00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,959
about me

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,959
i created a desktop app called developer

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,320
diary which is a privacy focused

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,560
note-taking app

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:23,279
available on linux on windows and mac

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,399
i founded invite which is a community of

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,519
remote developers

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,639
15 000 developers are member of this

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,760
community

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:34,399
it was started in 2016. i'm also

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,399
a producer of a developer conference

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,560
gate commit show which is a completely

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,320
online developer conference conference

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,720
and completely non-profit

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,720
started in 2019

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,800
i also contribute to some of the open

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,480
source projects

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:55,200
and i keep building some stuff

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,519
to teach people about full stack

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,880
development or related to security and

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,639
cryptography

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:05,360
and i have trained some students as well

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,480
and i love to play chess so if you also

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,000
love to play chess

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:13,120
do ping me after this talk

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,240
so this was a quick intro about me

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,959
the relevant experience that i have for

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,800
this talk

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:22,880
is building diary

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,680
so developer id is a privacy focused

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,680
note taking app

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:31,279
and i hope everyone can hear me

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:39,920
okay cool so developer id is a

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:43,680
privacy focused app for note taking

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,360
and especially made for developers so

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,600
if you have any thoughts in your mind

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,199
any solution that you are planning for

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,240
your problem you note down

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:55,120
uh quickly using a shortcut in this

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,880
app and when you are done with your work

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,920
at the end of the day you note down

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,320
things what you did in your day and then

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,920
just

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,480
move on with your personal life

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,600
and close whatever work that you have

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,600
for your professional work

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:17,040
and this app is available on

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:20,399
linux mac and windows i created this

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:23,839
using a framework called electro

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:26,959
and i have released more than 30

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:29,839
releases for this and also

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,480
the product which was predecessor of

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,600
this

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,959
app and i have i started

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,199
uh working on electron in working on

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:42,240
electron apps in 2016

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,000
so i have seen i have built apps using

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,399
electron one point x

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,399
to what current version we have in

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,480
electron 13.x

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,079
so that's a long journey and in this

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,040
long journey i have faced many

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,839
challenges

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,600
related to building the app as well as

00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,880
maintaining the app

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:04,160
so i have some experience which

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,440
can be relevant for you to speed up your

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,680
development

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:13,839
and to avoid the problems avoid

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,839
the challenges that i faced

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,839
so before we move uh dive into this talk

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,920
i want to ask this question to every one

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,920
of you

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,760
so the first option is have you used

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,000
electron before

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,000
so you will see the pole option if you

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,759
can answer yes or no

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,759
that will give me a better idea how to

00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,839
proceed

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,160
okay okay people are typing in

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,079
in chat you can also uh i would prefer

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,560
if you can share

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,839
via this poll option where you're asked

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,839
yes or no

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,399
so right after you have answered this

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,839
question i would also

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,680
want to know if you have which linux

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,440
distro have you used

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,839
in last two years and you can share with

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,959
me

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,480
uh is it debian debian is it fedora or

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,320
linux open shoes

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,680
or anything else if it is something else

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,680
please share that in chat

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:36,720
okay so 56 percent users have used

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:40,720
electron already cool

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,720
and the second question is on the screen

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,320
okay

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,680
okay cool very good so i think

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,360
half of the people almost half of the

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,839
people have used electron and half of

00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,480
them

00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:03,519
haven't used it so what i will do

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:08,480
i will move on to

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,480
the next slide alice can you enable

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,079
okay yeah cool so

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,760
debian is what we have received the

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,959
results debian 42

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:22,400
people have used debian and then uh

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,400
on second we have open source and fedora

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,799
then fedora and or our linux

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,319
okay great thanks a lot for uh sharing

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,960
your answers

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,240
so because uh half of the people haven't

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,600
gone through

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,760
don't know about electron i will

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,320
introduce electron and

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,960
even if you have used electron before it

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,760
a kind of

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,280
refresher for you and i won't spend much

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,840
time here

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,400
so let's quickly uh jump into the

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,720
introduction of electron

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,840
what is electron it's a framework to

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,280
build cross cross

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:58,400
platform desktop applications

00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,840
and so you can build application

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,280
for linux for windows for mac and also

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,240
on linux you can build

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:09,039
for all the distribution all the

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:12,640
distribution that we have for linux

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:16,080
now what do we have under

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:19,360
electron is chromium rendering engine

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:23,200
and node.js runtime um those

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:26,400
two things provide us the whole

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,880
experience of building cross-platform

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,799
desktop application

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,280
okay now as a developer when you are

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,919
using

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,160
electron you can code using web

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:41,440
technologies such as javascript

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,039
html and css and that's it that's all

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,320
you uh need to know

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,960
and with with this knowledge you will be

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,600
able to

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,080
build apps and you will be able to build

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:55,200
apps

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,200
for all the linux distribution platforms

00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:02,480
now let me show you

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,799
a quick glimpse of how does a hello

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,440
world in

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,840
electron looks like so look at the first

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,799
file

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:14,960
yellow file so here you are importing

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,799
app and browser window from this

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,000
electron framework

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,799
and then you are saying when a wrap is

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,360
ready

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,039
create a window a window that you see

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,559
which you can interact with this gui

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,840
window

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,600
and then what does create window means

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,679
you can see that it means

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,200
creating it is creating a browser window

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:39,760
accept some options

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:42,080
and then it says to load a html file

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,039
right and how does a html file looks

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,760
like we are

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,520
just saying hello world that's it and

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,600
keeping the background white

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,799
and that's it that's your hello world

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,000
that's your first

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:56,799
application using electron it is

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,679
that simple if and you want to build

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,559
more pages

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,840
you can you know html you just put your

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,039
stuff there

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,919
and there you have a ui ready for you

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,280
which will be available in all the uh

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,880
distributions of your

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:17,440
linux so that is the power of electron

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:21,919
using simple javascript html and css

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:24,559
you can create uh wonderful applications

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,520
and you do that quite fast so your

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,520
development time

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:31,760
is reduced you can get support from

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,880
many people who know web technology

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,480
which is

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,400
many people you don't need any

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,880
specialized skill for that

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,760
and learning electron js is also not

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,640
hard

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,200
you can simply go to this electron

00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,840
js.org website

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,200
their main website and you will get to

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,799
know how to build app

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,799
their documentation is amazing

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,120
and that i would suggest is a good

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,360
starting point

00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:01,200
to learn about electron so

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,600
you will learn about that and we won't

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,679
go into uh detail

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,200
but you have a basic idea how to build

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,200
an electron app

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,440
now we are moving to the second part of

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,440
this

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:18,159
talk where we talk about

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,600
now that you have coded your electron

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,840
application

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,520
how do you package that how do you

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,480
package that as a file which can be

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,360
installed

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,080
like a dab package or maybe a rpm

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,159
package

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:35,360
or any kind of file syst file that your

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:38,400
linux or distro supports

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,679
so how can you package this app this is

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,960
what we are going to discuss

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:45,200
in this slide and

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,679
the best there are multiple ways to do

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,799
this packaging your electron app

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,880
but the most reliable way that i have

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:56,000
found which works for me every time

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,760
is electron builder electron builder is

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,440
another

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:04,320
library another library which

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,880
is built for electron applications using

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,400
that

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:12,720
you can package your applications into

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:15,120
your desired format desired installers

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,840
or desired distribution file formats

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,240
that you

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:23,840
want to and you can do that

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:27,280
on your uh system itself

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,840
if you uh you choose one linux platform

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,039
let's say people said ubuntu is one that

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,240
they are using

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,559
most of us then you can build package

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,600
for

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:41,039
all other uh linux distributions like

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:44,080
you can choose arc linux open source or

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:47,200
freebst anything and you will be able to

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:51,120
build that from your own

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:53,760
uh linux uh system

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,400
now how does it look like when you pack

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,600
your zap

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,559
what code do you need to run and

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,440
this is what i'm showing here so

00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:04,799
package.json as you might

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:08,480
already know have already

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:11,760
knowledge of is dependency

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,640
management file for node related

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,440
application

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,520
and this is exactly what electron uses

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,799
to manage its dependencies

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:24,400
and there you define simply this

00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:25,760
dependency electron builder you define

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,960
the

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:32,640
version and then you define a

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:36,159
key value pair for build now this

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:39,760
key build will be used for configuring

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:42,960
your electron builder and let me

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:46,240
quickly uh give you what options

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:49,600
do you want to have to pay back your

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:53,440
linux desktop application so

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:57,279
first thing uh is

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:59,200
sr uh packaging so sr is a

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,440
you can say kind of a packaging or a

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,559
compression format that you use

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,880
and you can do without sr format as well

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,159
but

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,720
in my experience i have found this sr

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,919
format

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,320
is more suitable and you won't run into

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,960
any

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,000
kind of problem when you are using sr if

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,799
you are not using

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
sr then probably you will run into some

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,760
problems which i

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,960
had but when i used sr

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:29,200
format then i was i was not running into

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,400
any problems

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,240
was to define an app id for

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,559
whatever distribution that you are

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:40,000
distributing to they might need this

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:42,559
id it's an optional optional field

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,120
you don't need uh you don't absolutely

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,279
need it

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,880
but defining it i have seen is it's good

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:50,159
good to have

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,640
then the most important uh key uh

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,520
thing that you want to mention in this

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,039
configuration

00:24:53,520 --> 00:25:00,400
is this linux key which

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:05,120
is an object and that object

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:08,400
you define linux

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,400
first so linux when i'm saying linux i'm

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:15,840
telling this electron builder that

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,840
build or pack this app for linux

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,960
but we are not talking about them so for

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,400
now let's just focus on linux

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:33,360
and inside linux you want to specify

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,360
what target do you want to pack this

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:40,880
this app for okay

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,640
and you can choose

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,679
any of these targets that i have shared

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,200
here you will find all these

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,480
documentation on

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,400
electron builders documentation page but

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,720
just to give you an idea what kind of

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:56,320
package uh targets are supported

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,120
it's app image snap dab rpm freebsd

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,320
pacman

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,960
p5p apk and many more

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,320
so you get an idea that we this is

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,279
supporting

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,360
almost all the linux distributions that

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:12,159
we have

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,039
so you can build you can create that

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,480
file

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:19,919
which you will need to install your app

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,760
in different different linux

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,159
distributions

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,039
okay so that was about target you can

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,080
also choose

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:30,720
uh the architecture do you want to build

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,640
for 64-bit or 32-bit

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,000
for now we are not going uh into that

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,600
because usually we

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,679
want to build for 64-bit that's what

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,960
most currently so most systems are

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,679
currently but you have

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,400
option to build for older versions for

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:49,200
older architectures as well

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,840
and you can define all of them in one go

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,400
or like

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,159
build me a package for app image build

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,360
me a package for snap as well build me a

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,760
package

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,039
dab as well build me rpm and you can do

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,240
that all in one

00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:05,520
one go so this

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,960
is about the target that you want to

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,360
export your app okay then second thing

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,400
is

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:15,279
to keep in mind icons so

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,200
you want to define icon uh you put it in

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:19,760
a folder and you define that folder

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,960
named icon and that's where electron

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,000
builder will

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,480
pick your icons for your app

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,799
and if you miss to do that then your app

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,760
will be shown as a default

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,880
electron logo icon so you don't want to

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,200
do that

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,159
and which is why you define icons and

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,080
you define that in

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:42,480
multiple uh sizes so

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,000
and these configurations what sizes are

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,480
required you can find that

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,120
in electron builder documentation but

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,760
for now

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,159
this is good enough even if you put just

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,000
one

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:56,559
png file you are good to go

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,320
now another thing you may want to

00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,679
describe is the category of your

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,360
application so

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,039
because developer id was for

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,399
productivity so i

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:09,520
defined category as productivity

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:11,039
so that can be used for uh the

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,399
distribution platform that you want to

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,799
distribute to they might need

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,520
this kind of information that's optional

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,720
you

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:22,240
may or may not escape this

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,559
as you as you wish okay so this was

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,240
about this is how it the configuration

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:29,440
for electron builder looks like

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,559
and how you pack what command do you run

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,279
to pack this app now it's simply

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,640
electron

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:37,919
dash builder so make sure that you have

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,640
first of all make sure that you have

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,440
installed

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,720
this dependency electron builder and

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,679
then you can

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:49,520
run npm install so your electron builder

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,320
this library is installed and then you

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,960
can simply run electron builder

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,120
uh this way and one thing i like to do

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,240
is i like to create a script in packages

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,440
and which i

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,960
name build and there i mention this

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,880
command electron builder

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,279
so every time i don't need to write this

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,840
rather i write npm run build

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,559
you might know these tricks already so

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,000
not going

00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:16,480
there but it is as simple as this

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,360
you define linux object you define the

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,679
target

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,120
and couple of more things and you run

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:24,640
this command electron builder

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:27,120
and that's it your app will be packaged

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,679
one thing i would like to reiterate here

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:32,240
is that you can build package for all

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,720
a distribution on a single platform or

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,360
for

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,880
linux if you are building up for linux

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,399
packaging app for linux i would

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,559
recommend you to do that

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,440
on linux only whichever platform you

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,880
choose

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,520
i chose ubuntu and i built all the

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,919
packages

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,520
from ubuntu only but don't try to do

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,640
this from windows or from

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,399
mac os in those cases you might run into

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,679
some errors and

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:59,360
mentioning this that you can build all

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,919
the distributions from one

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,880
linux distribution is important because

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,360
when you try to

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,000
do this for other platforms like

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,360
building

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,440
windows app from a linux system or

00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,960
building mac os from linux system you

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,840
will run into challenges lots of

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,480
challenges

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,840
so the best way usually has been to

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,559
build

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,320
uh in the same system where for which

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,559
you want to distribute

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,640
but in case of linux you can choose any

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,320
other platform i have built in multiple

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,279
formats like rpm

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,080
pacman freebsd and i never run into any

00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,600
problems

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,159
except apk i was not able to make apk

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,320
work

00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,200
so that is something you might want to

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,480
keep in

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,600
your mind so that was about

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:48,480
packaging the app now you have this file

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,640
which can be installed if you have dab

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,600
you can install that using dpkg if you

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,880
have rpm

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:59,120
you can install it on fedora using rpm

00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:02,240
install command and so on

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,200
so how do you distribute this with your

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,720
target users

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,880
so the first thing is just share the

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,000
file that's it so that's a direct

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,880
distribution

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,760
put up a website and then list your uh

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,279
upload your

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,960
uh this file this packaged file

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,279
there and ask people to download from

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,320
there they will install from there

00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:24,320
so that is the first uh

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,600
that's the first distribution channel

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,559
that i went

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,200
then i see usually people will go for

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,720
this

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:35,200
distribution uh first and foremost

00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,120
benefit of this distribution uh channel

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,880
is that you have control

00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,399
you have all the complete control that

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,600
how you want to show and you have

00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:45,200
analytics

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,240
and uh you know a lot more thing than

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,320
you would

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:53,760
if you had distributed on other channels

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,240
now another an important important part

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,960
of

00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,399
distributing is not just the first time

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,360
you share that file

00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:02,159
what do you do after you release a new

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,320
version

00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,519
so you your users some of the users have

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,440
downloaded

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,360
the your application they started using

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,880
it now you are shipping

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,519
uh you ship your shipping 1.1 or 1.12 or

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,320
something

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,679
you are sending an update for security

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,120
or for ui

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:24,799
or for new features now how do you get

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:27,840
people to install your new app

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,279
so getting every communicating with

00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,760
everyone that's a

00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,640
long challenge that's a challenge and

00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,880
specifically

00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,799
even if you have their contact details

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,320
plea you won't have their contact

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,039
details they will simply download the

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,200
file

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,039
and then they will install and that's it

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,559
unless you have some signup mechanism on

00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:47,760
and so

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:50,960
but uh having said that

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,840
uh you want to enable auto updates so

00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,320
people who have

00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,200
already installed your applications can

00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,840
they get

00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,399
updates automatically so when they are

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,559
using

00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,919
and then they will get notification that

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,960
there is a new update

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:07,360
would you like to install it

00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:11,120
and similar to what you might have seen

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:14,240
if you have used visual code studio

00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,200
then you will see a notification that

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,000
there is a new

00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,840
visual code studio version is available

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,640
and when you click it you install it

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:27,120
and then it works so uh this also

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:30,480
reminds me that visual studio uh code

00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:35,039
is also built using electron

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:38,399
so that is one of uh one of the best

00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:41,760
example that i can give use of electron

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:45,279
to build a desktop application

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,799
oh yes as someone said visual studio

00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:51,039
code yes

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:54,240
so now enabling auto update

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:57,519
so one important thing to uh so

00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,320
electron has this auto updater module in

00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,679
its library which you can use to

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:06,000
automatically update

00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:09,679
the uh update your application

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,480
now one important thing to keep in mind

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,320
here is that

00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:18,639
it will work this inbuilt module

00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:21,520
to update will work only for app image

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,399
that's it if you have any other

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,919
packaging

00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:29,760
it won't work so you are stuck there

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:33,040
uh with inbuilt uh auto updating

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,159
uh module you can work only on app image

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,639
on linux

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,399
it works very well on windows and mac or

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,919
this auto update function

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:45,359
but on linux it works only for app image

00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:48,000
so remember that and when you have

00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:50,240
so right now we are completely talking

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,399
about app image only that's it

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,679
so if you want to update auto update

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,359
your app image

00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,359
first thing that you need to have is a

00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,760
release server where you host

00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:01,520
your files you host your file you host

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,320
your update files there

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,960
and this is what your desktop

00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,440
application

00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,440
is going to communicate with when it

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,560
wants to get a new version of the

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,720
application

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,640
now there are multiple solutions you

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,960
don't need to sit and start coding

00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,079
your release server rather there are

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,160
already

00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,160
existing solutions available such as

00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,119
electron release server hazelnuts or

00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,680
even you can use

00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,680
public github releases to do this uh the

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,079
best solution that i

00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,920
personally like has been electron

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,960
release server

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,800
so you can so you don't so you can

00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,480
maybe uh mention that if you are taking

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,760
notes electron release server is

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,280
something that

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,599
worked for me and probably it will for

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,680
you uh but you don't need to uh

00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,440
remember everything that i'm sharing in

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,000
this talk because i will share this

00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,359
presentation with you and i have added

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,359
uh proper links

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,800
everywhere you might need to visit those

00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:58,880
sites

00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,520
so so so one for the app image you want

00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,640
to enable

00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,640
uh automatic updates now you have uh

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,400
used electron delay servers to release

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,599
server to create your

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,880
server where you are hosting your files

00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,320
for

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,560
your linux app you

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,599
and it's pretty simple simply just clone

00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,640
the repo

00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:22,640
run it and that's it you you have admin

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,960
ui you just upload your

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,160
files there and you name the version and

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,200
that's it

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,079
you don't need to do anything else

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,880
it's pretty quick now you have this

00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,800
release server

00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,160
how do you get these updates from the

00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,079
release servers uh

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,520
from this client application from this

00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,680
desktop application

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,960
and for that i have included the code

00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,480
here if it is

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,480
too small uh let me know

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,040
right rice is sharing sharing something

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,760
we will come to that

00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,280
uh very soon about snap and everything

00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,040
but for now we are focusing on direct

00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,680
distribution so we are talking about app

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,400
image

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,920
for now and when you need to download

00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,480
updates for your

00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,880
app image this is this is how the code

00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,880
looks like auto updater is a module in

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,720
electron so you import it from the

00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:16,720
electron auto updater

00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:20,400
and then we have an event on

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:23,440
which is an event update downloaded

00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,480
if it is there then you show a user a

00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,119
dialog

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,240
and i'm showing that you have a new

00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,560
version available

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,760
would you like to apply those updates

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,040
into your app

00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,359
and once the user says yes then it

00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,160
simply calls this auto updater dot quit

00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:40,000
and install

00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,599
and that's it your update has been

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,640
applied nothing else

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,040
simple uh six seven lines or ten or

00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,079
maybe

00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:51,200
twelve lines of code and that's it your

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,960
app had been installed earlier it will

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,079
be updated when you release

00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,040
a new version on your release server so

00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,400
that was

00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:03,040
about the direct distribution

00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,200
okay you're sharing the file uh directly

00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:08,480
with your target users

00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,920
now let's come to the second uh

00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,240
part of the distribution which is

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,320
external distribution

00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,000
external distribution is where you are

00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,320
not controlling how

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,280
it is being shared with your target

00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,560
users

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:26,560
uh and how the updates are being applied

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:29,760
so you need to follow their rules and

00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,800
uh you uh you need to do some things you

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,160
need to modify

00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:37,280
probably in some cases to

00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:39,040
suit that distribution channel now i

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,079
have divided these external

00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,720
distribution channels in two forms one

00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,599
is the classic distribution classic

00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,119
distributions

00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:53,040
uh i mean they are

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:56,480
quite focused on one linux distro

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:59,119
one type of linux system

00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,079
while universal distribution are

00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,320
suitable for

00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:07,280
any type of linux linux system

00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,200
or linux distro so for example uh in

00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,119
classic distribution we have dab we have

00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,760
a dab for debian based system

00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:15,040
we have rpm for rail-based system fedora

00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,160
is one of the popular

00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:21,359
we have pac-man uh we have pac-man

00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,920
for uh arc-based uh

00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,200
systems and then we have freebsd for

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,920
freebsd

00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,760
uh systems and then uh in universal

00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,640
description we have three uh major

00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,079
choices

00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:37,200
one uh app image another snap

00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,839
and the last one flat pack so you

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,839
convert

00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:42,480
uh you distribute on these platforms

00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:44,640
only limited set of linux users who have

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,079
those particular type of distro will be

00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,280
able to install

00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:51,280
and if you distribute here almost all of

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,640
the

00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,440
all of the linux distro users will be

00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,800
able to

00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,280
use that now i'm sharing and there is

00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,560
one more thing you can actually convert

00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,119
these packages into one another that

00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,680
many of the linux users might be knowing

00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,680
but

00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,680
i consider that average user doesn't

00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,680
know this and i have seen that

00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,720
people have run into problems when they

00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:18,000
convert

00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,960
these packages into uh from one package

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,760
to another

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:25,839
so which is why discussing both of these

00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,839
very important

00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,240
okay now

00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,319
all right someone said that freebsd is

00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:38,000
using ports that

00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:40,560
is right so

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,400
but for now we are talking about uh

00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,359
whatever we had i think i'm not sure

00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,640
much sure about

00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:50,000
polls uh and i have never used freebsd

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,480
but this uh i'm sharing what i have

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,200
shared

00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,160
with my target users they asked me for

00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,040
some packaging

00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,400
and i created those packagings for them

00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,079
so let's talk about classic

00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,079
distributions first

00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,280
so because that is kind of fundamental

00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,480
thing and

00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,319
is a has been now for a long time so you

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,400
created a depth package

00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:11,839
you can uh distribute if you are just

00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,520
directly distributing it

00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:16,720
with your target audience they can

00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:19,359
simply go uh and type dpk ig minus i

00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,480
and then whatever is your name of your

00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,720
app and this

00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,040
dev file and that's it here the

00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,040
application will be installed

00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,160
now there are there is another thing

00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:32,160
that you can do

00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:34,240
that you can buy your own repository

00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,839
so here there were two steps one they

00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,280
downloaded the file and then they run

00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,599
this command

00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,480
and the the second option i'm telling

00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,359
you is about

00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,160
distributing via or your own repository

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:47,520
so you

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:50,240
add an repository and then you

00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,440
host your code there you need to follow

00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,319
certain guidelines and

00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,160
there are tools to uh do that so and i

00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,680
have included link here so once you get

00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,720
this file you can click on this and you

00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,079
will

00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:04,640
you will get to know that how to add uh

00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,599
how to create your own uh repository and

00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,240
then store your

00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,760
dev file there if you do that then you

00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:13,359
can do simply like this

00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:17,280
two command command lines one you add

00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:20,000
your repo your user has to add your repo

00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,920
to their sources list and this is the

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,079
command they can use sudo ad app

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,240
repository and whatever is your repo

00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,200
and then simply app install whatever is

00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,240
your name of your

00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,720
application so this is much simpler than

00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,599
this

00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,240
right but then there is some added uh

00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,119
tasks

00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,440
that you need to do then third uh third

00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,800
thing

00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,520
a third way to make this more usable

00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,000
more accessible is to distribute via

00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,200
debian

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,000
package repository so if you are

00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:52,079
able to distribute if you are able to

00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,599
add your package to debian or package

00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,599
repository

00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,839
you don't need to do this one as well

00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:58,720
you can simply your users can simply go

00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,560
apt install

00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,920
developer diary and that's it you are

00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:05,040
done

00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:08,720
having said that this

00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:11,040
was not possible for me and this might

00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,440
not be possible for many of the people

00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:16,160
there are restriction to

00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,680
distribute on debian package repository

00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,440
so make sure to read about it

00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,359
i have included the link you will get to

00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,920
know about all the information

00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,400
what are the restrictions and how to

00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,760
build

00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,359
uh how to distribute on debian

00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,800
but one restriction i would like to

00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:33,839
share with you is that

00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,160
if your app is not this

00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:38,079
does not follow these three things then

00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,119
you cannot publish on debian

00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:44,240
one if it is not free you cannot publish

00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:47,280
if you do not allow users to

00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:50,319
modify the code so the inherent

00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,280
uh condition is your code has to be open

00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:53,280
source

00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,800
people should be able to see your source

00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,839
code and

00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:00,319
they should be able to modify it if

00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:02,240
you are not allowing them to modify you

00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:05,040
cannot publish on debian

00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,240
if you do not allow your users to

00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,839
distribute

00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:13,040
your code your app

00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:15,119
then you can again not distribute on

00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,520
debian package ripple so these are the

00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,440
these are the limitations that you have

00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,000
and this process is going to be really

00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,640
long

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,359
for you to distribute i didn't uh go for

00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,760
this option

00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:27,760
because of all these uh challenges

00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:34,400
one free i think uh you cannot

00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,000
uh i think there are there you need to

00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,560
read this there was

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,079
an article exactly it talks about

00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,599
non-free as well

00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,440
so you might want to go through this

00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,520
article for now but for now i just want

00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,880
to summarize and give you a high level

00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,640
overview that how that

00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,520
these are the con there are some

00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:56,720
conditions and it will take some time

00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:59,359
uh for you to distribute that so

00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,319
i did not choose this i went for just

00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,920
the first one

00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:04,000
and probably very soon i will be

00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,800
distributing via my own repository

00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,680
as well so this is what i would

00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,079
recommend as well

00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,839
that first create that and then whenever

00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,359
you have time distribute via your own

00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:16,960
repository

00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:19,359
and maybe when you have a lot of users

00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,000
and you want to make it more accessible

00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,839
probably

00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,520
is a good time too and also you follow

00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:27,119
those license

00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:31,040
conditions that i shared then go for

00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:31,040
sharing on debian package system

00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,960
okay so now coming to uh more

00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,640
classical or distributed classic

00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,359
distribution channels uh

00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,079
rpm pac-man freebsd if you have rpm

00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:44,160
package

00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:46,880
then you can simply go rpm minus i and

00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:49,599
then whatever the name of your app

00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,119
and for rpm you can also again similar

00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:54,319
to apt you can

00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:56,960
choose yum you can distribute yim

00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:57,520
and this way you can share on many of

00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,800
the

00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:03,599
rail based systems and that's much

00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,800
easier i think so yum install a

00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:08,240
developer id

00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:11,680
is i i see many people prefer this

00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:15,839
over rpm so it is a good idea to

00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:15,839
publish there as well

00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:22,400
now coming to uh other other

00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:24,079
linux distro pacman if you are sharing

00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,560
on pacman pacman

00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:27,359
minus s and uh this is an app name

00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,240
that's how you

00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:30,640
install and similarly for uh freebsd you

00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,760
can use

00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,319
pkg install and so on so those are

00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,640
simple

00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:37,440
but how do you uh just i never got

00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,560
requirement

00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,480
for people to say that they need uh the

00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:45,839
app to distribute on some

00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:48,079
catalog on pacman or freebsd so

00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,040
i i never published there and that's

00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,280
something up to you

00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:53,359
if you want to put in efforts there but

00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,319
for me uh the most important one are the

00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:57,599
ubuntu

00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:59,839
so to be distributing via ubuntu

00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,440
uh for and making it easier there and

00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:06,480
then rpm was the second

00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:09,520
most uh channel that

00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:14,160
and that also we saw in today's

00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:16,160
poll as well so that was about classical

00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,240
uh distribution now coming to universal

00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,920
distribution you publish on one

00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,440
distribution channel and it is available

00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,160
on all the linux distro

00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,559
how can you do that so there are three

00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,440
uh

00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:29,280
main ways that we i highlighted app

00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,920
image snap and

00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,800
flat pack so going through each of them

00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,480
one by one and

00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,160
i'll just highlight few of the things

00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,920
that will help you make the decision

00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,280
where to invest your more more of your

00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:43,040
energy so

00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:46,559
one first one is app image

00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:49,119
installing app image is

00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,720
that simple there is not nothing more

00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:53,119
simple than app image

00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,000
you just click you just bring your file

00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,119
to your

00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:00,640
system and then you just click

00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:04,480
that's it and your app will run

00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:05,280
nothing else needed most easiest way to

00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,680
install

00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,880
any linux application is app image and

00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:12,880
which is available on

00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:16,000
almost all linux distro so that is

00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,960
the benefit of app image that you do not

00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,440
have

00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,960
and there is no extra step to publish

00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,240
you don't need to do anything

00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:25,599
for other other distributions we are

00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,160
going to see that you need to do

00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,720
something

00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:30,240
only then you will be able to find your

00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,040
applications in their distribution

00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,319
channel

00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:35,280
app image no extra step and then another

00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:37,359
benefit is that

00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,920
you can support auto update out of the

00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:42,000
box you don't need to do anything else

00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,800
to update you don't need to set up a

00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,319
release you don't need to

00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:50,400
rely on someone else's system

00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:52,640
rather you can build your own release

00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,640
server and then from there

00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,319
automatically using the auto operator

00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,520
module of electron you can auto update

00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,119
your app image

00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,119
so these are the benefits uh

00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:04,480
disadvantage

00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:06,240
no desktop integration so when it comes

00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,520
to creating shortcuts and

00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:10,880
pinning it to the bar and any uh desktop

00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:14,079
integration that you would want

00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:16,800
as uh as an app user for

00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,599
uh or then those are not available to

00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,280
you though so

00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:22,079
and this is a very serious uh

00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:24,319
disadvantage

00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,319
some people downloaded our app and then

00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:28,400
they just forget about it because

00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:30,640
they installed it in some folder but

00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,720
then they couldn't find it anywhere

00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,079
there was no shortcut there was no uh

00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,040
tight integration with the with the

00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,839
desktop

00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:39,119
so that was a huge problem and

00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:41,040
specifically it is for

00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,400
genome for genome you do not have this

00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,440
desktop integration

00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:48,559
uh i think for free uh not a freebie

00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:51,599
uh for kde tdkd you might see there is a

00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:54,240
desktop integration and then this

00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:56,000
uh this will vary for other distribution

00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,720
some will support desktop indication for

00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,920
app image

00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:02,559
some will not so quite

00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,800
confusing situation over there and we

00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:07,359
can definitely say that universally

00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,800
you do not have desktop integration you

00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:12,800
have for some but not for

00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:16,480
all second or big drawback was that

00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:19,760
you cannot auto start an app image

00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:23,119
and that is true for again genome

00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:24,480
but for kd again this is true that you

00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:27,680
can auto start

00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:30,720
but again we can see say that for all

00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:32,480
linux distribution you cannot uh you

00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,000
cannot auto start for all the

00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,359
distribution you can do this for some

00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
but not for

00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:39,200
all then third important point is

00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,520
security

00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,319
so it's simply everything is packaged

00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,880
there

00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:46,000
you just click run and then give it

00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,720
permission and that

00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,599
that's it it will run your code it's

00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:53,119
highly

00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:56,640
uh it's a very

00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:59,119
good solution to port your

00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:00,240
malware to different machines but as a

00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,240
user it is

00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,359
not a good idea i wouldn't trust an app

00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,559
image

00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:08,800
so and also in other type of systems

00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:11,119
they have some checks and balances which

00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:13,839
helps us increase security

00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:14,720
in app image none so as a user i

00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:18,319
wouldn't trust

00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,800
app image and uh as a user i will find

00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:21,200
it

00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,000
a little bit my experience won't be that

00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,359
good as i

00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,400
wanted to be and as an app developer

00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:31,200
i simply skipped this i

00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,240
supported app image earlier and that was

00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,800
my primary

00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,440
way to distribute but later on because

00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,599
of these

00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:42,960
two limitations specifically

00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:44,480
i removed my focus from app image it is

00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,400
available you can download it if you

00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,400
want it but my focus is not there

00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:54,800
okay now

00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:57,839
second snap so

00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,200
this is a very new thing uh for me at

00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:02,160
least it was

00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:05,200
uh it was new thing and very good

00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:07,359
experience i would say

00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,839
in terms of publishing there was no

00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:12,800
effort in publishing to snapcraft

00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:14,480
and installing was quite easy i just

00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,440
typed this command snap installed

00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,559
developer id

00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:20,400
and installed my developer diary and

00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,839
it was quite simple it has also the

00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,640
versioning systems

00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:25,280
so i can publish in beta channel and

00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,400
then i

00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:31,520
have a stable channel

00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,480
and a very good solution so a couple of

00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,040
things that

00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,480
i like about snap is that it provides

00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:39,520
sandboxing

00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,920
so this adds an extra layer of security

00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,280
for

00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:46,400
uh users and they are they can

00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:48,640
trust app they download from snap

00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:51,680
more than they would download directly

00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:53,680
from a website or via app image

00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,359
so that is one interesting thing about

00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,359
sandbox then delta updates

00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:58,400
you are pushing another update to your

00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:59,839
application

00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,680
or you don't need to ship the complete

00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:05,200
code rather just uh

00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:08,240
push the diff and that's it so

00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:11,920
it makes a network request lighter

00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:14,400
and the user experience becomes better

00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,200
one disadvantage of snapcraft i see is

00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,480
that

00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:21,280
its server is not not

00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:23,440
open sourced it is a centralized system

00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:26,559
snapcraft is centralized system

00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:29,520
so so this is one thing about

00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:31,520
snapcraft that i didn't like but other

00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:33,520
than that i think snapcraft is an

00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:36,800
amazing solution to distributor app

00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:38,000
and uh i think every every developer

00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,040
should be

00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,119
uh publishing on snap at least this

00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:46,000
gives me

00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:46,880
okay so i will uh i would want to wrap

00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,960
this up i have

00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,079
we are talking uh talking a lot about

00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,319
our distribution

00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:54,000
so one quick thing i want to say is the

00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:58,400
snap is a good solution

00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:00,720
and uh you should publish on snapcraft

00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,920
you have everything to gain nothing to

00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:05,200
lose

00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:08,800
and flat flat pack flat pack is also

00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:10,000
similar to snap and but it is open

00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,160
source server side as well

00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,520
as the client side and it is uh

00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,200
decentralized which is

00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,559
another good thing and then things are

00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,720
similar to

00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,240
the snap like it has sandboxing feature

00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,160
delta updates feature

00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:24,319
and the effort to publish is a

00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:27,520
non-trivial it's not as

00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:28,720
easy as snap but it's not uh that a big

00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,280
difference either

00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,160
and you install install installation is

00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,319
also

00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,760
quite easy flat pack install flat up and

00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:38,000
then whatever is the

00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,119
id of your app and you type it here and

00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,119
that's it done

00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,319
it supports all these platforms many of

00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,240
the

00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:46,160
i can see almost all the platforms are

00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:49,520
supported and same is the case with

00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:52,160
other like snap also this support

00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:53,920
most of the linux distro now coming to a

00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,480
comparison of universal distribution

00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,799
channel

00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,960
i have actually shared with you already

00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:02,000
uh whatever i found important

00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:03,920
but uh just to be extra sure if let's

00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,280
say you do not have time or you just

00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,520
want to focus on one distribution

00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,200
channel i have included this comparison

00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,920
table for table for you where you can

00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,000
see

00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,280
uh differences between app image snap

00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,559
and flat pack and

00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:18,720
this is thanks to the show source of

00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:20,000
app image github they created this

00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:23,359
comparison table

00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,760
and it's quite good now

00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:27,359
coming to another point once you have

00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:30,559
built the app you have to

00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:34,400
maintain your app and this is

00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:36,799
i think you will say

00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,240
uh okay neil says that's weird

00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:41,280
distinction to make between

00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:42,079
low and non-trivial right we will

00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,040
discuss that in

00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:45,839
q a uh maintain your app so one thing uh

00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,319
that

00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:50,319
i didn't realize when i was starting to

00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:51,040
build electron that you have to maintain

00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:54,640
your app

00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:57,760
and maintaining an electron app is a

00:55:54,640 --> 00:56:00,000
task is a chore you

00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:02,160
so and there are some things that will

00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,720
help you make this task easier

00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,599
one is always upgrade your electron and

00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,880
nodes version

00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:10,559
every quarter do not wait for uh

00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,640
one year or two or whenever you are

00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,480
releasing always upgrade your electron

00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,200
on node versions otherwise your user

00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,280
will be stuck

00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:18,799
such as it happened with me my users

00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,119
couldn't log in i had this

00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:22,240
google login and because i did not

00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:24,880
update this

00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,440
electron version which means essentially

00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,040
that

00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,559
the chromium version that i was using

00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:31,599
that was not updated

00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:33,200
which means that when google uh go

00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:34,880
when someone is signing with google

00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,680
google sees that this is coming from a

00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,720
browser

00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:40,079
which was quite old and uh that might

00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:43,040
have some security issues

00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:44,960
so google did not allow user to sign in

00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:48,000
as a security measure

00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,799
so it is always a good idea and in favor

00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,400
of your

00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:54,960
user that you upgrade your connect home

00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,000
sorry for interrupting uh but we are a

00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,480
little bit

00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,280
running out of time so if you can wrap

00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,880
up

00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,200
okay just give me two minutes and i'll

00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:05,359
just wrap it up sure

00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,880
there's just one more slide after this

00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:09,839
okay so

00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:11,119
maintenance always upgrade your

00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:13,359
electronic node versions

00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:14,559
every three months and that's the ideal

00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:17,200
timeline that i found

00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:19,040
another thing is always tests before

00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:21,599
packaging

00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:23,200
so you have a good system in place to

00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:26,240
test your

00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:28,160
application and you test it before

00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:30,079
packaging you test it after packaging

00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,799
and only then share it i have made many

00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:34,160
mistakes

00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:36,880
such as distributing a buggy application

00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,520
another thing is use typescript now when

00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,720
your code

00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:44,000
becomes big which will uh absolutely and

00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:48,319
i and i kept scratching my head when

00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:51,119
it happened and it was a nightmare to

00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:52,960
change anything it was nightmare to see

00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:55,280
that things are breaking

00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,200
so solution could have been typescript

00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:00,000
so i have started using typescript

00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,520
use that another is manage a different

00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,040
version if you want to manage different

00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,599
versions

00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,559
okay so we will skip this part for now

00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:08,720
and we will go to

00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:10,160
our last final thing which is analyzing

00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,799
and improving

00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,520
so the one particular insight that i

00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:15,200
have

00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,799
from my experience of last four years of

00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,799
building electron app is that

00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:20,240
for linux users is that linux users

00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:23,520
expect privacy

00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:24,000
a lot than any other platform so uh do

00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,799
not

00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,319
include any uh analytic service such as

00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:30,079
google or

00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:32,000
there are some external services do not

00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:33,680
use them rather you can

00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,040
uh implement but you still need

00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:38,160
analytics to improve

00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:41,359
so okay and the way i did was that i

00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:43,760
created simple bash file which takes

00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:45,440
the request logs to my server so

00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,200
whenever my app loads

00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,799
after some time it sends a request to

00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:52,000
update server do

00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:54,640
do i have a new update for the app and

00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,280
i log this request and i analyze those

00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:58,400
requests

00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:02,000
and based on the unique ips

00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:03,200
i see that what how many number of users

00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,440
do i have

00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:07,200
how many number of returning you just do

00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:09,040
how much average time is spent

00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,559
i'll share this script with you in in a

00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,720
github gist and

00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:13,760
uh probably or you can you can ask me

00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:16,799
for this in

00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,119
on my twitter or this is how it looks

00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:18,720
like

00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:21,680
it's a simple command to calculate

00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:25,839
downloads simple uh res x

00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:27,920
and okay if you have any

00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:29,040
of you can reach me out on these

00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,319
channels and

00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,640
i am open to questions okay uh there are

00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:35,280
some

00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:37,040
questions yeah but we don't have time

00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,880
unfortunately so

00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,720
would be great if you could type down

00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:43,680
the answers and we can leave the space

00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,680
for the next speaker

00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,599
some script something thank you so

00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:49,599
thanks a lot everyone for joining in

00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:00,160
okay so moving ahead we uh our next

00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:03,280
speaker is alexander

01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:04,720
smith if i pronounced it right

01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,640
and he will be talking about

01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:08,640
fragmentation in open source world

01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:11,680
and the challenges to create a healthy

01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:13,839
and sustainable project containers

01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:15,040
hi hi fagon can you please confirm you

01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:18,960
can hear me

01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:21,280
yes yes you are great so hello everybody

01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,160
my name is alexander zemke i'm one of

01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,079
the

01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,920
developers maintenance of the project

01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:26,839
called laplace i'm going to talk about

01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:30,640
this

01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:32,480
project soon and the title of my talk is

01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:34,319
on the fragmentation in the open source

01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:37,599
world and the challenges

01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:41,280
um caused by this

01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:44,319
with respect to the maintenance of

01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:48,000
such projects so let me start with um so

01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:48,000
let me see how to navigate here

01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:55,440
okay so let me start with some general

01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:57,359
um statements and consideration so open

01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,640
source community open source movement so

01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:00,160
many people associate

01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:02,000
uh immediately automatically

01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:05,280
contribution of millions of

01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,319
volunteers um many many people across

01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:09,599
the whole world

01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:13,839
working having the same or similar

01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:15,680
mindset ideas and um

01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:17,520
ideas and vision about how to develop

01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,960
the software how to distribute it how to

01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,960
make it available

01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,720
for the society so there's a big amount

01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,799
of manpower across

01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:26,799
the whole world contributing to this

01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:28,559
movement so while this is of course true

01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:30,480
for the whole movement in general

01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:31,920
this is not necessarily true if you go

01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,839
down to the level of

01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:36,079
every single project so we have many

01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:39,520
projects with a lot of manpower

01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:42,799
and we have projects uh um struggling

01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:44,319
to to maintain maintain the project in

01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:45,760
the long term

01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:47,680
so there are different challenges for

01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,559
different projects of different sizes

01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,079
and this so like

01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:51,599
big projects have different problems

01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:53,760
compared to

01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:55,280
challenges you have if you maintain a

01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,559
small approach again there's for sure

01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,960
and overlap between

01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:00,960
between these challenges and um so

01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:04,640
there's one important aspect of one

01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:08,000
important factor that is more critical

01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:10,079
for smaller projects

01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,760
okay so in in general so if i talk about

01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:13,920
small project it doesn't mean

01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,039
we are talking about a trivial trivial

01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,880
approach to providing

01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:18,720
some trivial functionality so if i talk

01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,359
about small or big project i always

01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,920
refer

01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:22,799
to the amount of manpower available in

01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:26,559
this project

01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:27,920
so the human factor even factor related

01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:30,319
to the amount of manpower

01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,039
is more critical for small approaches so

01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:32,839
let me

01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:34,720
let me spend some time talking about

01:02:32,839 --> 01:02:36,799
this

01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:38,799
so what many people what may you think

01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:41,039
or assume usually is okay so there's a

01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:43,440
project i'm using there's an application

01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:45,200
freely available and if i have some

01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,319
future requests or if i have some bug

01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,559
reports so i

01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:50,319
report this and then there's this

01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:52,240
expectation okay so that people

01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:53,920
behind this project that will take care

01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:55,039
of this they will provide implement this

01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:57,039
new feature that

01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:58,880
will work how the fix will provide the

01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:00,000
next update and so on and so on and goes

01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,680
like this

01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,280
more or less forever okay while i'm

01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,880
using this project so they're always

01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,559
well i'm using this application there

01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,839
are always people behind this project

01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:09,599
who

01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:11,359
will make sure you know this is this

01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:12,240
project is still alive and what people

01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:14,720
don't understand

01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,280
not always understand is maybe you know

01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,119
the

01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,880
developers and maintenance behind this

01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:20,880
project are human

01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,920
beings too so most of us are working on

01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:26,480
this approach in

01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:26,480
our free time spare time and um

01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,760
it's getting more and more harder as if

01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:31,200
your approach gets bigger and bigger i

01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,720
guarantee bigger with respect to the

01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:34,960
feature set so it's getting harder and

01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:36,559
harder for you to maintain such approach

01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:38,160
so you have a limited amount of time at

01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:40,640
some point in time

01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:41,920
um maintaining such approach it becomes

01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:44,559
becomes a work for you

01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,200
so it's not it starts maybe as a fun as

01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:47,440
a pet

01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,640
hobby approaching okay and results in

01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,000
additional additional

01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:51,280
work for you so you're getting more and

01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,079
more professional maybe with your

01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,559
project

01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:56,400
and this basically adds on top of the

01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:58,319
usual stress you have in your life

01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:00,000
so it's getting harder and harder and

01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:01,760
then people also can have personal

01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,520
interests and motivations

01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,799
that change over time so people can

01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,799
decide to

01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,920
stop working on this project okay and if

01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:09,599
you don't make sure

01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,200
don't make sure there's somebody who can

01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:13,280
pick up the work you

01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:15,039
did before if there's nobody else who

01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:17,359
can continue working on this

01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:19,599
the project is more or less done okay so

01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:20,960
this situation is very very critical for

01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:23,520
for the smaller project where we don't

01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:25,280
have enough people at h2

01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:27,920
so because of this reason so it's very

01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:30,480
very hard for these small projects to

01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:32,319
safeguard the maintenance the really big

01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,760
reliability of the project in the long

01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:35,760
run

01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:37,440
and what many so this is also my

01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,599
personal impression so many

01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,280
developers in this open source community

01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:43,359
heavily underestimate

01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:45,599
the import uh the importance of the

01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:48,640
invest in the long-term maintenance

01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:51,359
and i will talk about couple of examples

01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:53,119
on the next slides so one important

01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:54,319
problem or one important aspect here in

01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:56,640
this discussion is the

01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:58,160
fragmentation of resources or lack of

01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,359
collaboration between the different

01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,200
people uh

01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:03,039
working on similar projects so instead

01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:04,319
of working together let's say working

01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:06,559
together on the same

01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:08,400
same approach you combine combine the

01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:10,480
available resources that are spare

01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:12,799
anywhere you know people um

01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,319
prefer to work on their hobby projects

01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:16,000
and this is maybe successful for a

01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:16,720
couple of years but then because of the

01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,559
reasons

01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:20,319
mentioned above you don't manage to

01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:22,480
continue working anymore this project

01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:24,880
you stop doing this and

01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:28,000
this is clearly not a healthy healthy

01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:30,960
sustainable situation for your project

01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,280
so i would like to um make these

01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:36,079
statements now more precise to quantify

01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:38,799
them a bit and i would like to do so

01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:40,720
by using um the examples by using the

01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:42,079
project i'm working on and by using

01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:44,160
the examples for a couple of other

01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:46,400
projects that are similar

01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:48,880
to our project so the project i'm

01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,000
working on is called laptop laplate so

01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,760
for those who

01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,039
don't know this application very quick

01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,599
introduction about it

01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:56,640
so laplate is a kde application for

01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:59,280
interactive

01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:00,079
graphic and analysis of scientific data

01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,079
so this is

01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:03,119
just to get your brief introduction so

01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:05,599
you get an impression

01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:07,520
about what this kind of application can

01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:10,240
do for you

01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:12,079
um so this is application following the

01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:15,200
the graphical user interface

01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:16,480
approach you can import the data into

01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:18,720
this application we support

01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:21,200
multi-performance like ascii binary

01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:23,359
multi-dimensional formats like html5

01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:26,000
feeds and so on and so on so you import

01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:28,640
this data in the application and you can

01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,799
prepare visualization so we also support

01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:33,520
um

01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:35,359
live data meaning so you have data

01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:38,559
located somewhere in the heart this or

01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:41,039
coming over the network um from local

01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:42,799
network circuits mqtt or from serial

01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:44,799
port and then you basically connect to

01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:47,599
this data sources and

01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:48,880
application visualize visualize the data

01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:51,839
for you on every

01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:53,119
uh data update basically so right now we

01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:55,839
support only 3d

01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:57,119
dimensional visualization and on top of

01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:59,760
the visualization we

01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:01,520
provide also multiple what we call

01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,720
analysis functions okay analysis

01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:05,359
functions this can be a

01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:06,160
is sorry this can be either feeding

01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:08,079
smoothing

01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:10,079
phosphory transformation interpolation

01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:12,319
integration differentiation of your data

01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:13,200
and so on and so on so it also provides

01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:15,599
some basic

01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:17,440
statistical capabilities this is

01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:21,520
actually something an area where we plan

01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:24,319
to add much more in the future

01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:26,240
so we also support access to multiple to

01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:28,400
different open source computer algebra

01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:32,160
systems being maxima octave

01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:33,760
r or also to dynamic script languages

01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:35,440
like python

01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:38,000
and children so with this we basically

01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:40,000
allow allow to access a huge amount a

01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,960
very very powerful set of features

01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,240
provided by this systems and once you

01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:46,319
are done with your analysis of data

01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:48,720
visualization so you can export

01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:50,880
uh the results if needed to multiple to

01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:53,680
different formats and you can embed them

01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:55,440
in your publication and so on and so on

01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:57,520
okay so this is a very brief overview of

01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:00,400
the feature settings so if you want to

01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:01,200
need if you want to see more visit our

01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,440
web page

01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:04,799
so here a couple of screenshots so here

01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:07,839
you see a typical

01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:09,680
session of flat plot this is the main

01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:11,039
window on the left hand side you see

01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:13,039
there

01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:14,559
you see the uh what we call project

01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:17,759
explorer where all the

01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:18,239
um objects you created in this project

01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:19,920
are

01:08:18,239 --> 01:08:21,759
shown and then you basically click with

01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:24,799
the mouse uh select

01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:25,520
object uh you get it you get the content

01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:27,040
of this

01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:29,120
object basically shown in the middle

01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:31,120
area the main area of the application

01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:32,880
on the right hand side you can modify

01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:34,560
all the properties

01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:38,159
of the selected options so in this

01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:40,080
specific case some data some

01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:42,480
experimental data was imported in the

01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:44,960
application then we perform a feed

01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:45,920
by using a certain mathematical function

01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:49,040
we perform a fit

01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:50,560
to this um measured data okay so this is

01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:52,000
how this application looks like and then

01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:55,199
you can once you are done

01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:57,600
you will you you can export the results

01:08:55,199 --> 01:09:00,880
so here another example of what you can

01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:02,960
do with laplace here we are plotting uh

01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,719
we are visualizing a mathematical

01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,960
function defined

01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:08,319
a certain parametrization okay this is

01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:10,719
the so-called

01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:12,560
butterfly curve very very nice example

01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:16,880
and i wanted to use it here to show

01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:19,440
here in this session too

01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:21,359
so i mentioned the access to multiple

01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:22,080
computer algebra system and this is how

01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:23,600
it looks like

01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,600
so what you see here on the left hand

01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:29,520
side is a notebook

01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:31,359
um using maxima maxima is a well-known

01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,000
open source computer ultra processing

01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:35,199
maybe the

01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:38,400
most most powerful one in this area and

01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:40,239
um of course it's also possible to do

01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:42,080
visualization in this computer algebra

01:09:40,239 --> 01:09:43,359
systems okay but our approach is

01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:45,120
basically we do

01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:47,279
the calculation inside of such a

01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:50,319
computer algebra system session

01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:52,880
and we

01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:55,040
provide the exposed data the results of

01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,760
this calculations we expose this to the

01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:58,800
laplace

01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:01,199
runtime and then we basically can

01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,000
visualize visualize the produced data

01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:05,199
the results

01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:07,679
by using our graphical interface

01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:08,960
okay in this specific example uh duffing

01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:10,640
oscillator

01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:12,800
uh the properties of the stopping

01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,679
oscillator they're calculated so this is

01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,120
an

01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:17,360
oscillator that can develop a chaotic

01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:20,960
chaotic behavior

01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:23,199
and then um a couple of relevant

01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:24,640
metrics describing this oscillator this

01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:28,159
is the schematic behavior

01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:31,199
uh visualize on the right hand side

01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:34,560
okay enough of it advertisement

01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:35,440
for that plot um i hope you got an

01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:38,480
impression about

01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:43,360
uh what this project can do for you and

01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:46,080
um well this is not the only project

01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:47,440
that can do this stuff so i will

01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,080
introduce shortly a couple of other

01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:50,239
projects

01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:51,760
um so while talking about when talking

01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:55,760
about fragmentation

01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:57,679
fragmentation of resources and um

01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:59,120
the amount of manpower you have attached

01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:01,440
to every single project so

01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:03,360
somehow we need to quantify this and i

01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:06,960
would like to quantify this by

01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:09,280
using the uh git the commit statistics

01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:11,440
so here i extracted the statistics from

01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:13,600
github for our approach again for

01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:15,120
for the next projects i'm going to show

01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:16,960
soon

01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:20,400
so what you see here is the history of

01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:20,400
laplace in the last

01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:24,400
10 12 years okay so you see so the first

01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:27,280
two

01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:28,159
top contributors so those are the uh

01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:31,360
basically there are

01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:34,400
two core maintainers of this project

01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:36,159
and we see the number of commits

01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:38,239
every day or every week but the

01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:40,320
resembling is used here right now

01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:41,280
so you see a constant constant active

01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:43,600
work done over

01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:44,640
multiple multiple years but again so

01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:47,600
only two

01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:49,679
core developers right now so we have a

01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:52,080
couple of other guys i'm showing here so

01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:53,679
those are our students so we are

01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:55,679
participating in the google summer of

01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:57,280
course for multiple years already we try

01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:59,600
to attract new

01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:01,440
new contributors new students and by

01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:04,000
utilizing basically this

01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,880
program so what you see here are our

01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,360
students

01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:08,000
so this guy actually um i mentored him a

01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:10,719
couple of years

01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,360
ago and then one two years later he

01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:14,480
became

01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:17,040
um became a jesuit mentor too

01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:18,880
okay so this was kind of a success story

01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:21,600
for us we managed to enable

01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:22,480
one person and um this person continued

01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,640
contributing

01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:26,800
to the project even after jesus project

01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:27,520
was his project was finalized okay so

01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,679
this guy

01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:31,120
was mentoring these guys couple of years

01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:33,040
later

01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:34,960
so he disappeared then for one two three

01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:37,280
years because he need

01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:38,960
university uh was over he was somewhere

01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:40,560
in the university and then you i mean

01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,520
you have your own personal life you need

01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,280
to organize

01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:44,880
a job you know you need maybe to move to

01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,000
another city and so on and so on so it

01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:49,360
took some time

01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,880
for him to to finalize all this stuff so

01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:52,480
he is now returning back started

01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:55,199
contributing

01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:56,560
um recently again so we have a couple of

01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:58,400
other contributors

01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:00,080
let me show this here again so a couple

01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:03,679
of czech students here

01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:07,280
so this guy is actually one of our users

01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:10,080
who is quite active with respect to

01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:11,840
providing generating new ideas but also

01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:14,560
providing providing fixes

01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:16,239
and also developing new features okay

01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,280
this is of course an ideal situation

01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:21,040
when you manage

01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:24,320
to convert one of some of your users to

01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:26,159
to to to contributors okay

01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:27,600
so you see also this guy please remember

01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:30,640
this name you will see

01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,600
this name later on again so this is one

01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:34,880
of the

01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:37,679
translators in kde at kde

01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,640
okay and this is the person helping out

01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:41,760
all the time

01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:43,520
to make sure that translation and

01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,840
localization relevant stuff is properly

01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:47,520
done in our code

01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:49,280
so this is the station for approaching

01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:51,120
again two core developers spreading

01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:53,040
contributions from other people

01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:55,040
and well this is the status of this

01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:57,280
project right now

01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:58,400
we are not alone okay so there's similar

01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:01,440
projects um

01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:02,320
out there and uh let me spend some time

01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:04,159
talking about them

01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:06,719
so first of the projects i decided to

01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:08,480
pick here is side davis side davis

01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,239
abbreviation standing for

01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:12,400
scientific data analysis and

01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:15,120
visualization so actually the history of

01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:17,600
this project is quite interesting one um

01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:18,400
side davis resulted as a fork of another

01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:21,840
project

01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:25,440
that went closed sourced close source

01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:27,280
15 years ago 20 years ago so i'm not

01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:30,159
going to talk about this project

01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:30,640
and the two guys who um this

01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:34,080
project

01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:36,480
original project they quickly realized

01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:38,400
okay so the code base we have right now

01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:40,640
this is maybe not in the best shape

01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:42,480
we would like to rewrite everything and

01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,920
but this is a lot of work okay so you

01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:46,080
quickly realized

01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:48,080
it's going to be hard so you kind of

01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:49,520
understand the amount of um

01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,880
the number of features you would like to

01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:52,080
provide you understand the overall

01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,920
feature set

01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:55,199
that this kind of application needs to

01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:57,040
provide to the users

01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:58,480
in order to be accepted in order to have

01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:01,040
a chance uh

01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:03,040
out there and they quickly realized okay

01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:04,719
we need maybe to collaborate with

01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:06,320
somebody else they started looking

01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:09,040
around and they

01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:10,000
encounter found laplace okay at that

01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:12,480
time at that point

01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:15,120
in time let plot had this transition

01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:17,280
from q3 to q4

01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:18,560
major reflecting major rewrite and

01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:20,480
actually so instead of

01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:21,600
adjusting migrating the code so we

01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:24,320
decided to

01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,199
start from scratch okay we started from

01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:28,480
scratch

01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:29,840
and uh sky the side davis guys decided

01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:33,040
to participate in this

01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:33,920
so we used used laplace repository we

01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:36,480
used this

01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:38,159
new code where we tried to incorporate

01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:40,080
all the experience

01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:41,600
we had from the past every everything

01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,080
that went wrong so we wanted to do

01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,719
better

01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:45,199
okay so we worked together for i don't

01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:48,640
know

01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:51,520
one year two years and then um so very

01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:54,800
very healthy collaboration very active

01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:56,159
phase for all of us and then at some

01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:58,480
point in time one of the

01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:59,199
side davis guys decided to quit this

01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:03,280
business

01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:05,520
so he became demotivated

01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:07,440
he had other activities in his life so

01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,960
did the motivation change interest

01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:10,239
changed and he also he became

01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:13,600
demotivated because

01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:14,560
of the amount of work you need to do to

01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,480
invest here

01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:18,480
to get the project to a level where you

01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:19,600
would like to have it okay you can as i

01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:22,719
mentioned before so

01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:24,880
that the overall scope of such a project

01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:26,640
is very very clear for all the people

01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:28,560
working in this process so most of us

01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:31,760
have an academical background so

01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:33,440
during our university time phd times you

01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:35,360
know we worked obviously working with

01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:38,880
this kind of application so you kind of

01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:40,560
know the overall feature set okay now if

01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,840
you start implementing the features and

01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:44,000
you extrapolate

01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:45,120
extrapolate to the level uh what you

01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,000
would like to see

01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:49,840
for your program you can you can uh

01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,960
estimate the amount of time you need

01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,719
here okay and this was

01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:54,480
one of the reasons for this guy to quit

01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:56,560
so he said no i mean it's not

01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:58,560
it's taking too long of my time too much

01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:00,400
of my time it will take too long

01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:02,239
for all of us to become successful i

01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:03,520
don't want to do this anymore okay so he

01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:06,480
created this business

01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:07,920
and a couple of months uh later the

01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,960
second developer of society was

01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,360
disappeared

01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,400
so the second guy didn't even notify us

01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,480
on

01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:16,000
on the mailing list so there was no

01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:18,000
personal email sent

01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,600
he simply disappeared okay not clear not

01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,719
clear what happened to him

01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:25,440
and um well at this point in time so

01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:28,000
uh sai davis was quite popular on

01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:29,760
sourceforge popular with uh in the sense

01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,880
of you know so the number of downloads

01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:32,880
for this fortune

01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:34,480
per month was very very high and

01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:36,640
salesforce didn't want

01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:37,679
this project to die because of its

01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:40,800
success okay

01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:42,960
and then um sourceforge um

01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:44,080
did some advertisement on their homepage

01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,159
so this day

01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:47,120
they started looking for another

01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:48,960
maintainer

01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:50,960
for this project and there was one guy

01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:52,159
who decided to take over the maintenance

01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:54,880
here so that they

01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:56,640
joined this program uh this project took

01:17:54,880 --> 01:18:00,239
over basically everything

01:17:56,640 --> 01:18:02,560
and um yeah so he became basically the

01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:04,159
maintainer of this project

01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:05,840
a couple of months after this we reached

01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:07,280
out to this and there was maybe one two

01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:08,800
or three other guys who

01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:10,480
started working on this project too

01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,280
because of all this advertisement and

01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:13,120
noise

01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:14,400
did by sourceforge so there were

01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:16,560
multiple people who

01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:18,239
took over the work so we reached out to

01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,600
them and asked for collaboration and

01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:21,520
asked to continue the

01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:23,360
the successful and very productive

01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:26,960
collaboration we had with the original

01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:28,159
two hours authors of this project and

01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:30,239
they didn't show too much of the

01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:32,000
interest okay so for them i mean

01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:34,560
they they were struggling with the

01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,440
overall uh amount of code in the future

01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:37,840
say

01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:38,880
set of side davies anyway and it was

01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:43,679
hard for them

01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:46,159
to move on now to yet another project

01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:46,880
um well so the project i think is still

01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:50,400
alive but

01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:52,239
it doesn't have any any big development

01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:54,480
of new features so there's more or less

01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:56,719
maintenance work so keeping keeping

01:18:54,480 --> 01:19:00,400
alive what was created in the last

01:18:56,719 --> 01:19:00,960
years and yes so maintenance is still

01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:04,159
done but

01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:06,640
no major major development done anymore

01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:08,000
and what you see here so there was there

01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:10,159
was some activity done by

01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,600
another user and so this guy also

01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:14,800
disappeared here

01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:16,320
2016 so there was another guy who

01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:19,280
started contributing here

01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:20,960
and was not quite happy with the overall

01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:24,159
architecture of this court

01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:25,920
so he decided to fork this okay like one

01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:28,400
of the problems um

01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:29,040
in the open source community so you you

01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:31,360
um

01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:33,199
don't talk to each other you the

01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:34,800
project okay i'm not saying this is

01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:36,480
always the case but this

01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:38,480
happens from time to time so this guy

01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:41,280
 uh

01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:42,000
uh front side davis and created alpha

01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,679
plot

01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,760
okay so this is now a screenshot and the

01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:48,480
statement the description from

01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:49,520
from this from from from the home page

01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:52,080
of this project

01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:54,080
so this is how a typical uh session

01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:55,440
looks like inside there's an alpha plot

01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:57,840
so they looked they have

01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:58,960
more or less the same feature set and

01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:01,600
what is being done here

01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,800
what was done here uh basically this guy

01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:05,280
decided to

01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:06,320
move to another floating library here so

01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:08,239
instead of using

01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:10,320
the code the old library that was used

01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:11,679
by side data he wanted to use

01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:13,760
something that's more more than

01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:15,280
providing more features and having more

01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:17,440
maintenance and so on and so on

01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:18,639
okay this is basically refactoring done

01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:20,960
by the sky here

01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:22,239
and then adding more new features again

01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:24,719
similar situation here

01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:26,400
so quite some excitement and activity at

01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:29,520
the beginning

01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:31,280
and this is what i um

01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:33,600
always referring to so it's very very

01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:35,280
sad very very easy to start a project

01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,120
okay so you are very motivated you are

01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,600
eager to develop something it's very

01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:40,159
easy

01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:42,000
very easy to do the first steps um

01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:44,480
during this development during this

01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,320
excitement phase okay but then at some

01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:48,800
point in time you run into this

01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:50,400
saturation phase where it's not so easy

01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:52,080
anymore to do the next steps

01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:54,400
okay you have technical challenges you

01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:56,000
get challenges uh

01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:57,679
because of your personal life because of

01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,120
the limited amount of time and so on and

01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:00,960
so on so all these factors

01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:02,320
i just got in the beginning so you run

01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,840
basically into these problems

01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:05,280
at some point in time okay and this is

01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:07,440
what we see here so after this

01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:09,840
excitement phase after this very

01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:11,199
active development phase it went down so

01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:13,199
there was no nothing done

01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:15,199
anymore and then you see these different

01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:18,400
phases you know where this

01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:19,120
one single person uh finds uh where this

01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:21,920
person finds

01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:22,639
some time to contribute to okay so big

01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,560
breaks

01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:25,679
in the development of this project there

01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:28,800
again some

01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:30,560
some live shown here and but more or

01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,520
less you know so one man project

01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:34,080
to no further contribution from

01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:37,679
[Music]

01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:39,440
other people um so there's one more

01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:42,560
project to mention here so this is

01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:44,639
called views um

01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:46,080
i would say you know out of this project

01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:47,280
i mentioned here this is maybe the

01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:50,000
project with the

01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:51,199
biggest amount of feature sets said

01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:54,400
having also the

01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:57,120
longest history here maybe um

01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:59,760
also more or less a one-time project

01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:01,760
okay this is a guy from academia

01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:04,239
who apparently has enough time to

01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:06,320
continue working on this

01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:08,000
on this project working on this project

01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:09,360
already for many many years so the

01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,880
project was still active still

01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:12,639
maintained and

01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:15,120
a couple of years ago so i reached out

01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:16,639
to this guy and asked for collaboration

01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:19,360
like you know so we are working on the

01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:21,679
same same um

01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:22,880
functionality we are using cube you know

01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:24,639
so there's a lot of

01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:26,239
a lot of stuff maybe to be shared so

01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:27,840
let's come together let's work together

01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:28,800
on something that is much much bigger

01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:31,360
that

01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:32,560
than compared to what we have right now

01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:34,719
in our approaches like

01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:36,080
working alone and then so this guy

01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:38,159
didn't show too much of

01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:40,800
interest you know and then we went

01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:43,040
different ways separate ways

01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,639
again and continue working on our

01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:46,960
projects

01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:47,760
alone so also here you see so this is

01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:52,159
more or less

01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:56,000
one one main project

01:22:52,159 --> 01:22:56,000
so one more project to mention here

01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:02,159
it's actually another project from the

01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:05,280
kde community it's

01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:06,880
called case team so this is

01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:09,840
also a project having a very long

01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:12,320
history and this project is known for

01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:13,280
for its speed okay so the setting i took

01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:16,239
here is

01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:18,400
from their home page and you see a

01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:20,800
typical session where some live data

01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:22,960
is visualized so incoming data and high

01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:25,360
frequency

01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:26,800
is visualized and then certain analysis

01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:28,159
functions like smoothing maybe is

01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:29,600
applied you know and then

01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:31,679
you get basically this kind of

01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:33,600
visualization

01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:37,679
so let's check let's check the activity

01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:37,679
and the activity for this project tool

01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:42,320
so over here more or less the same

01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:44,639
situation we have one to two developers

01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:45,920
contributing to this project so one one

01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:48,960
developer who

01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:52,560
managed to work for a substantial amount

01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:53,600
time of time managed to contribute to

01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:56,800
this project

01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:59,280
and he more or less disappeared

01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:02,080
two years ago okay so right now there's

01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:04,800
nobody else who can pick up this project

01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:07,360
so there are many other several several

01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:10,800
emails sent to the mailing list

01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:13,199
users asking for

01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:15,440
updates for some maintenance related

01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:17,199
work for new builds for windows for new

01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:18,960
versions of windows and so on and so on

01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:19,840
again there's more or less nobody who

01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:22,480
can

01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,199
reply who can take over the work that

01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,880
was done

01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:27,440
that disguise here okay there was

01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:29,840
another guy who was quite active

01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:31,360
who has his active face disappeared

01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:34,480
completely too

01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:39,040
okay so right now this project is not

01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:39,040
i would say not alive anymore

01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:44,320
okay as a short summary maybe so what

01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:46,800
you see here so for this kind of

01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:50,480
applications we see a very

01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:53,600
fragmented distribution of development

01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:56,000
resources so we see mostly one to

01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:57,440
two main projects and these different

01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:01,040
approaches have different

01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:02,719
speed of development for laptop i would

01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:05,360
say right now we have a

01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:06,960
very very active very healthy

01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:07,679
development phase of these two

01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:10,320
developers

01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:12,000
including these ratio the four are

01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:13,760
working very well together so

01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,320
very it's a lot of fun developing

01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:17,840
working together years will be

01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:19,920
uh i would say you know very very

01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,880
productive very very effective right now

01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:22,639
so there are no

01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:24,000
bigger discussions so we're highly

01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:25,760
aligned um

01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,040
very productive mode right now no

01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:30,239
conflict uh

01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:31,360
conflicts uh but it's clear you know

01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:33,600
this won't go

01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:35,280
on forever because of the reasons i

01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,000
mentioned in the beginning so they still

01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:39,520
need to

01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:41,760
think about what to do how to do the

01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:43,360
project setup properly so we don't run

01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:45,440
into this situation

01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:47,280
like for a couple of other projects i

01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:49,280
showed before

01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:51,040
and also right now so even being very

01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:52,320
effective very productive we are still

01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:55,520
very limited

01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:57,920
uh with respect to our to our time okay

01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:58,880
so we know what as i mentioned before so

01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:01,280
we know we

01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:03,040
know very well what needs to be done but

01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:04,159
we need to develop what our users are

01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:06,800
expecting from us

01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:07,760
also either by comparing ourselves with

01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,679
other

01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:11,120
similar open source projects or even

01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:13,440
with commercial approaches

01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:14,560
that have a very very big feature set so

01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:16,400
we know pretty much

01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:18,400
what needs to be done here okay and then

01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,960
we again kind of extrapolate the amount

01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,800
of time

01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:22,000
we would need here and then we realized

01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:24,400
okay this will take

01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,280
us years and years many many years to

01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:27,679
get to this level

01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:29,520
okay so somehow we would like to speed

01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:31,920
up speed up this development

01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:33,520
so being effective being productive is

01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:36,080
not is not enough here so

01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:36,960
the amount of manpower we have here is

01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:38,639
uh

01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:40,960
not enough to do the next steps so we

01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:42,080
would like to bring the project to uh to

01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:44,639
the next level

01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:46,719
and having the other resources uh

01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:48,719
available right now is maybe not enough

01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:50,320
so we would like to change this current

01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:52,000
situation so there's challenges

01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:53,600
i mentioned before so we would like to

01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,120
address them somehow so we want to do

01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:57,600
the next step

01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:58,239
in the development of the project and we

01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,600
want to

01:26:58,239 --> 01:27:02,320
um make sure you know so we have this

01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:04,480
healthy

01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:05,760
situation in the project going on for

01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:09,280
many many

01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:10,960
years near future in future

01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:13,440
so what we are doing what we are doing

01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:15,679
here right now so we are looking for

01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:17,520
signatures and collaboration with other

01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:19,440
projects so with other projects so i'm

01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:21,440
not referring anymore to the

01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:22,960
projects i mentioned before because here

01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:24,239
the situation is clear so they are

01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:26,800
either not active

01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:28,400
anymore or we already reached out to

01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:30,159
them there was no big interest to

01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:31,120
collaborate okay so i don't think so we

01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:33,040
are going

01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:34,880
we are going to reach out to these guys

01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:36,239
again so we are looking here basically

01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:38,159
for

01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:40,080
uh for other projects or for other

01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:42,080
frameworks libraries

01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:44,080
that we can utilize that we can use in

01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:44,880
our application that would help us to

01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:48,000
speed up

01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:49,840
basically the development of the project

01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,080
so we also would like to intensify the

01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:54,159
activities within our within kde within

01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:55,360
our organization so those activities are

01:27:54,159 --> 01:27:56,960
basically around

01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:58,639
around packaging of the software

01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:01,600
distributing it through

01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:02,800
various uh app stores like microsoft

01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:04,719
store uh

01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:07,199
apple store and so on and so on so we

01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:10,400
have um

01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:13,679
um we would like oba already

01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:15,360
making more use of the artifacts built

01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:17,679
artifacts produced on the build

01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:20,159
infrasubject kde lake and also this

01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:22,080
installer provide nightly installer

01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:23,840
nightly build to this installer provided

01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:24,880
for windows station image provide for

01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:27,600
mac os

01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:28,000
users and we do a bit more advertisement

01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:30,239
around

01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,840
this build artifacts we invite users to

01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:33,760
test to use overnight clips it's not

01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:37,600
only on linux where the dissipation is

01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:39,600
clear right so we also want to attract

01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:40,639
so we realized actually so we have many

01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:43,360
many users

01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:44,960
coming from the windows world and we

01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:46,320
don't want to block them don't want to

01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:47,840
completely ignore them

01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:49,920
and now we are also inviting more and

01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:53,120
more of these users to

01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:54,800
test to test their nightly builds okay

01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:56,639
and the results for this are produced on

01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:58,400
the centrally available infrastructure

01:28:56,639 --> 01:29:00,080
kde

01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:02,080
so we also also the documentation we

01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:03,840
have right now this is uh definitely

01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:05,120
something that is not on the level where

01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:07,280
we would like to have it

01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:08,719
and also here so we are looking for some

01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:14,719
synergies collaboration

01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:19,199
within the kde kde organization

01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:20,880
um yes maybe i i i would like to

01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:23,040
make a short pause here so i mentioned

01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:26,639
the infrastructure infrastructure

01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:28,320
built infrastructure and

01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:30,400
so there are many many people working

01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:34,000
behind the scenes contributing

01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:36,239
uh to the success of our project or to

01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,960
to the success of other projects at the

01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:40,960
kde so people are taking care of of the

01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:42,159
build infrastructure people taking care

01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:44,800
of the promotional

01:29:42,159 --> 01:29:45,760
documentation translation localization

01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,440
of

01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:49,120
of the application and so on and so on

01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:50,639
you know so these people are usually not

01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:53,760
the frontman

01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:55,679
of the project so they are not visible

01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:56,960
in many many cases okay but they are

01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:58,080
definitely there and they're

01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:59,920
contributing

01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:01,440
a lot a lot to the success of this

01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:02,480
fortune and i think so all these guys

01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:04,719
they self

01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:06,960
deserve a lot of appreciation so let me

01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:08,800
use maybe this opportunity to thank

01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:10,719
all these people working in these areas

01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:12,400
um so i really appreciate it

01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:14,480
appreciate the help okay see what you're

01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:17,520
doing here so ben yuri

01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:19,360
paul um carls and many many others

01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:21,120
are doing their work behind the scenes

01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:23,199
thank you a lot

01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:25,280
same of course for the for the organizer

01:30:23,199 --> 01:30:26,239
organizers of this event so alice and

01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:30,000
other people so

01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:30,719
thank you a lot so to improve to improve

01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,400
the overall the

01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:34,400
current situation right now so we also

01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:36,960
plan to increase the frequency of

01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:39,760
releases so this is one of the problems

01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:40,560
we have right now where we don't didn't

01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:42,719
pay enough

01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:45,660
attention maybe in the past so the

01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:47,520
release when we consider

01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:49,440
[Music]

01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:51,600
and they consider the current new

01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:54,000
feature set to be big enough

01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:55,120
and so there are no regular regular

01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:58,239
releases

01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:58,800
right now so we do a release um once per

01:30:58,239 --> 01:31:00,639
year

01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:02,159
so less than a year maybe and this is

01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:03,520
something that we definitely need to

01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:08,159
change so we

01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:08,159
are releasing in big bunches and um

01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:13,040
we should do the same difference if we

01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:15,440
should release more frequently and

01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:17,280
uh because you know releasing releasing

01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:19,760
getting getting additional attention to

01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:21,679
your projects anyway

01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:23,120
so and you want to invest more into the

01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:23,920
promotion work to attract new

01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:26,320
contributors

01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:27,360
so having not enough resources not

01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:29,280
enough contributors

01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:30,880
is a challenge for this kind of project

01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:32,159
for the small courses so at the end this

01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:35,199
is definitely something

01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:38,320
we need to change by by attracting new

01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:38,320
new people to the project

01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:42,239
so i mentioned synergies and you know

01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:43,280
working together collaborating with

01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:46,000
other projects

01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:47,760
and maybe just to give you one example

01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,840
so what i'm showing here is coming to a

01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:51,440
counter is another kde application it's

01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:54,080
a front-end for

01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:55,600
uh front-end to different uh

01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:57,199
mathematical applications to the

01:31:55,600 --> 01:32:00,159
different open source computer

01:31:57,199 --> 01:32:01,520
algebra systems like maxima octave and

01:32:00,159 --> 01:32:02,480
so on and so on okay this is what i

01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:04,560
mentioned in the

01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:06,800
in the beginning and this is one of the

01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:08,800
signatures one of my

01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:09,920
examples i'm usually referring to in

01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:12,159
this context

01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:14,080
so this is maybe had a big big

01:32:12,159 --> 01:32:15,920
additional value we added um

01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:17,600
to level because of the collaboration

01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:18,800
between the support these two projects

01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:20,400
within kde

01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:22,080
so this is now another project and

01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:25,840
contributing to also

01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:27,360
mentoring gzip students um so this is a

01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:29,600
stand-alone application

01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:31,679
okay but what we did basically so we

01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:34,880
embedded the runtime we embedded this

01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:36,960
this application into into laptop we

01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:38,320
enabled this connection between the the

01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,600
computational part

01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:42,320
of this application and the

01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:43,840
visualization part of flat plot okay and

01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:44,639
then with this we basically provide

01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:46,960
enable uh

01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:48,320
completely new workflows and provide a

01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:50,880
big additional value

01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:52,480
to our application okay so this kind of

01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:53,520
signatures this kind of collaboration

01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:57,280
this is what we are

01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:57,280
looking for here basically right now

01:32:58,159 --> 01:33:04,719
i mentioned the promotional work um

01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:07,920
to be honest um so there's a certain

01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:09,120
certain change in the mindset happening

01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:10,960
on our side

01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:12,239
okay so we plan to invest more in this

01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:15,440
direction now and

01:33:12,239 --> 01:33:17,840
um i don't want to say we completely

01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:18,719
ignored the promotional part in the past

01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:20,840
okay but

01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:22,239
i would say we heavily under

01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:24,080
underestimated the

01:33:22,239 --> 01:33:25,840
impact or the importance of this

01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:28,320
promotional process somehow you have the

01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:30,159
impression or you have this perception

01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:31,520
you're writing the best code ever so

01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:33,760
you're working on the most

01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:35,920
coolest features you know so you're much

01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,639
much better than your direct competitors

01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:38,080
and

01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:39,920
so all these users you're trying to

01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:40,800
address so they will automatically come

01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:43,840
to you

01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:47,120
okay this is kind of a

01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:50,480
mindset uh we had in the past okay

01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:53,280
and this didn't go well okay this was

01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:54,800
of course correct to a certain extent

01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:56,320
okay we managed to attract certain

01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:57,760
amount of users okay but this is not

01:33:56,320 --> 01:34:00,080
enough and we did manage

01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:02,320
so following this uh strategy this

01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:05,280
philosophy we didn't manage to attract

01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:06,800
any any new contributors okay so this is

01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:07,360
not something that we would like to

01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:10,159
change

01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:11,440
so we invest now we started investing

01:34:10,159 --> 01:34:14,719
into

01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:17,440
into the documentation

01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:19,840
example tutorials and so on and so on so

01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:22,080
is this this is something that was not

01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:24,480
uh didn't get enough attention from us

01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:27,840
in the past

01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:30,480
um we also invest now into the ux

01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:31,920
um the ex part of the application so we

01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:33,840
need to make sure you know the

01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:37,040
application is not only usable

01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:39,199
by us but also by um

01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:40,239
by many other newcomers here so actually

01:34:39,199 --> 01:34:43,119
there was a commit

01:34:40,239 --> 01:34:44,639
on a comment on one of the graded reddit

01:34:43,119 --> 01:34:46,639
articles published by the kde

01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:48,400
promotional team and one of the users

01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:49,840
the comment was like this okay so i

01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:51,520
installed laptop

01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:53,679
looks great so the screenshots on the

01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:55,679
homepage look great but i don't see how

01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:56,400
to visualize how to import and visualize

01:34:55,679 --> 01:35:00,480
the data

01:34:56,400 --> 01:35:02,400
okay and this was kind of um

01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:03,840
well this was a very critical comment at

01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:05,280
least for me you know because you are

01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:07,199
working on this application for many

01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:09,199
many years and everything is very very

01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:11,040
clear to you so you know how to import

01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:13,040
it how to visualize and you think you

01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:14,639
assume everything is very very easy to

01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,040
understand and then you are confronted

01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:17,600
with

01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:19,600
such a statement from a newcomer from a

01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:21,119
new user again and you see okay people

01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:23,520
don't manage to

01:35:21,119 --> 01:35:24,960
to work with your application right away

01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:26,840
so you need additional help okay and

01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:29,840
this is something that we need

01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:32,639
uh something that we take very very

01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:34,320
seriously and try to improve more

01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:36,800
so the overall plan is of course to

01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:39,600
attract new contributors to add

01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:41,040
to convert ideally we managed to convert

01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:43,600
some users

01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:46,000
of this application into contributors so

01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:48,400
mostly users in this community

01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,280
have their required technical background

01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:51,600
so they have

01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:52,560
technical skills okay and then if these

01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:54,800
people have

01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:55,679
already some skills in c plus plus acute

01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:57,679
area

01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:58,719
so these people of course are very very

01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:00,560
welcome here

01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:03,520
and the overall goal so without putting

01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:06,880
this now very very negatively so

01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:09,199
the final goal is to make your

01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:11,280
yourself redundant so what do i mean by

01:36:09,199 --> 01:36:13,199
this if some of us if one of the core

01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:15,440
developers decides to

01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:17,520
quit the project okay as it was the case

01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:19,040
for a couple of other examples i

01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:20,719
mentioned a couple of minutes ago

01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:23,040
so if this person disappears for some

01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:24,480
reasons okay so there must be somebody

01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:26,239
somebody

01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:28,880
else in this watching this community who

01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:29,679
can step in and take over basically what

01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:31,840
you

01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:32,719
what you what you were doing before okay

01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:34,320
so it's like

01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:36,320
like you know so the hard disk in your

01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:37,280
computer so if your heart this crashes

01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:39,119
and if you don't

01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:41,199
don't have any backup if you don't if

01:36:39,119 --> 01:36:42,960
you don't have any any possibility to

01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:43,600
restore your data to replace the hard

01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:46,639
disk

01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:47,760
okay your system is smallest done and

01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:49,520
this is something that

01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:51,520
you can also so you can also apply the

01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:53,600
same arguments to the maintenance of

01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:56,719
such open source fortune so if you want

01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:58,320
for long if you want to have a healthy

01:36:56,719 --> 01:37:00,400
maintenance for a

01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:01,760
long period of time you need to make

01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:04,840
sure there is somebody

01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:07,600
somebody who can take over your

01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:09,840
activities

01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:11,920
of course all these things mentioned

01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:14,000
here this additional work into the

01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:15,280
promotion documentation and so on and so

01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,520
on this results in

01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:18,560
additional work and additional effort

01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:20,639
for the maintenance

01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:21,920
as i mentioned before we also want to

01:37:20,639 --> 01:37:24,400
developers

01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:26,480
that need to do a lot of development we

01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:27,600
think we need to write hardcore code so

01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:30,000
we need to write a

01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:30,960
code that is not always trivial okay and

01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,040
then on top

01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:34,960
on top of this work you need to also

01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:36,719
work out all the other points

01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:38,880
mentioned above so this basically

01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:40,639
results in additional work and effort

01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:42,480
for the maintenance at least in the

01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:44,480
beginning until you manage to organize

01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:46,560
additional power here okay but

01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:48,320
without doing this additional work

01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:50,480
without doing this additional effort

01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:52,159
i simply don't see how to change the

01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:54,560
overall situation so as i mentioned

01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:57,440
before so right now healthy situation we

01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:59,040
continue working on the project but uh

01:37:57,440 --> 01:38:02,080
this this

01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:03,040
it's clear to everybody uh to all of us

01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:05,360
so this can

01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:07,199
this can go on like this forever there

01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:07,600
will be a point in time where we need to

01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:09,520
create

01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:11,679
where we need to hand over to somebody

01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:14,880
and then there must be somebody who can

01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:14,880
take over this activities

01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:19,840
um yeah at the end it's not about uh

01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:22,320
finding the proper balance between

01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:24,080
doing the development work and finding

01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:26,880
enough time to do the promotional

01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:29,440
promotional part of the project

01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:32,800
maintenance

01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:36,480
um so the last

01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:38,800
slide in my presentation um

01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:40,719
i mentioned multiple times um you know

01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:43,679
we have not enough time

01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:45,199
or having enough time is a problem it's

01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:47,679
a critical factor

01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:48,800
for people contributing to to open

01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:51,920
source projects and

01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:55,280
projects having a non-trivial

01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:57,360
amount of features so now we need to

01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:58,480
invest into the promotion so having

01:38:57,360 --> 01:39:00,480
finding time

01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:02,080
for the promotional work is a bit hard

01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:03,040
and if you find if you manage to find

01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:05,840
some time for this

01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:06,719
so we want to be as effective as

01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:08,880
possible

01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:09,920
okay so at the end it's all about uh

01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:12,159
being

01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:13,840
more effective using the time you have

01:39:12,159 --> 01:39:15,840
and then producing the biggest output

01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:18,639
out of it

01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:19,520
so what i'm showing here are two tweets

01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:22,159
um

01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:24,400
from the last year so in the past we

01:39:22,159 --> 01:39:26,480
only published something on our

01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:28,080
home page when we did a release okay so

01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:29,280
there's a release announcement some new

01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:31,920
releases available

01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:33,360
we write a big blog post introducing uh

01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:35,520
introducing all the new features

01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:36,800
available new release and this strategy

01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:39,760
we decided to change

01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:41,520
so now we basically report every couple

01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:43,520
of weeks on the current

01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:45,440
development activities so if there's a

01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:47,040
new feature that landed in master

01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:48,960
so we introduced this you know as we

01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:51,679
prepare a new blog post we tweet

01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:53,450
on twitter with the help of the kde

01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:54,800
promotion team we

01:39:53,450 --> 01:39:56,400
[Music]

01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:58,239
distribute this information through

01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:59,280
multiple channels and what you see here

01:39:58,239 --> 01:40:02,880
on the left hand side

01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:05,040
is a tweet published last year where we

01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:07,040
introduced a new feature

01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:08,639
that was finalized back then so this

01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:10,400
feature was around this what we call

01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:12,719
info element okay with the help of this

01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:16,400
feature it's possible to attach

01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:17,920
attach um a label to your data point and

01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:18,719
then this label basically keeps the

01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:20,639
position while

01:40:18,719 --> 01:40:22,480
zooming in zooming out and deploying or

01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:23,760
doing different navigation here

01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:25,920
and then you can modify all the

01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:27,360
properties of this uh info element okay

01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:29,840
so this kind of

01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:32,000
feature was introduced uh last year

01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:33,040
finalized last year and then we wanted

01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:36,239
to

01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:37,920
um to write an article about this

01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:40,560
okay and usually so we try to find a

01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:43,040
good example um

01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:44,800
for the data uh visualizing our

01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:45,360
application so in this concrete example

01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:47,840
so

01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:51,360
i selected i chose the data for the

01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:53,840
distribution of the hydrogen in our

01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:54,639
um galaxy so what you see here so the

01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:57,280
three peaks

01:40:54,639 --> 01:40:59,280
are basis so the measurement at 24

01:40:57,280 --> 01:41:00,480
simply at 21 centimeter emission line of

01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:03,360
the hydrogen

01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:05,679
is measured in a certain direction

01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:06,719
relative to our position relative to our

01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:09,199
solar system

01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:10,239
and as you know so our galaxy has a

01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:12,880
spiral

01:41:10,239 --> 01:41:14,560
form and into the direction uh where

01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:17,760
this measurement was done into so

01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:20,880
we basically see cb probe

01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:24,000
this emission coming from the three

01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:25,280
spiral arms okay because of this spiral

01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,400
arms having the different

01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:32,239
velocities because of the doppler shift

01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:32,800
so this emission line is shifted okay

01:41:32,239 --> 01:41:35,040
and these

01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:36,719
three spikes you see there's three peaks

01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:38,000
you see here basically they correspond

01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:40,880
to the three

01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:41,840
uh um spiral arms of our galaxy that are

01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:45,600
visible

01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:47,840
from our from our solar system

01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:49,520
okay so very very nice example very nice

01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:53,199
physics behind this so i was

01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:54,960
i i really liked this uh example i was

01:41:53,199 --> 01:41:56,800
proud of it okay i was really really

01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:58,480
proud of it and then on the next day we

01:41:56,800 --> 01:42:00,800
produce another tweet so this was kind

01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:04,239
of a fun tweet maybe

01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:06,480
i did a picture of my um

01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:08,080
workspace of my desk okay and then we

01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:11,600
invited our

01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:15,040
followers to a small quiz so we asked

01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:16,960
to find to identify 12 kde related

01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:20,159
things so what you see on this picture

01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:21,679
is my cat so he was

01:42:20,159 --> 01:42:23,679
a bit aggressive at this point in time

01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:25,679
he aggressively refused to

01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:27,679
leave the desk okay since i didn't have

01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:28,000
enough time for this activity for this

01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:30,239
photo

01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:32,719
session and i didn't want to escalate

01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:34,159
the situation a bit further i decided to

01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:37,760
leave him on the desk and then do a

01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:37,760
picture everything okay

01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:44,400
um well this tweet with the cat

01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:47,119
brought us four times more attention

01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:48,480
use an impression on twitter okay so

01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:52,480
apparently

01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:54,560
having uh uh with the cat is um

01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:56,000
more popular more attractive than

01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:58,080
talking about the distribution

01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,840
of the high direction in your galaxy

01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:01,679
okay so this is a lesson to learn from

01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:03,840
this and maybe this is also the

01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:05,679
recommendation for everybody who is who

01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:08,719
is tweeting

01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:10,320
um cats seems to be very very popular so

01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:13,440
if you manage to incorporate

01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:15,280
cat in one of your tweets um

01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:16,639
attention impressions are guaranteed for

01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:19,760
you

01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:23,199
okay so kind of a fun fact

01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:26,239
and i think this is also the last slide

01:43:23,199 --> 01:43:27,840
um the last slide in my presentation so

01:43:26,239 --> 01:43:29,840
thank you everybody for your attention

01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:31,520
so i think we still have some time for

01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:33,760
questions and if you are watching the

01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:36,000
recording now and would like to

01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:37,440
reach out to us asking questions so this

01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,400
is uh

01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:42,159
the link to our home page multiple base

01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:45,040
documented there how to reach

01:43:42,159 --> 01:43:47,520
out to us and i think so using the our

01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:49,840
room on metrics and pds metrics is maybe

01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:51,920
the most easiest most comfortable way

01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:54,400
to get in contact with us thanks

01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:54,400
everybody

01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:57,600
yeah there is one question in the shared

01:43:57,040 --> 01:44:01,119
notes if

01:43:57,600 --> 01:44:01,119
you can take

01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:08,000
have you found any correlation between

01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:10,800
software internalization and code

01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,800
contribution

01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:22,400
to be honest not i mean of course

01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:24,080
we know so and by checking the

01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:27,199
statistics we know

01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:30,719
into which languages the software was um

01:44:27,199 --> 01:44:31,119
was um was translated and we have couple

01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:33,600
of

01:44:31,119 --> 01:44:35,360
um certainly we have a couple of

01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:37,760
translators who are more

01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:38,800
active okay so we have we have software

01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:41,679
kde software

01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:42,960
is uh translated in in some languages uh

01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:45,040
you know to a better

01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:46,560
extent compared to other languages but

01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:48,320
this doesn't mean you know so we have

01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:50,239
more contributors here so we have maybe

01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:51,280
one or two persons doing this and they

01:44:50,239 --> 01:44:54,159
simply have

01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:54,719
more more time here okay to do this work

01:44:54,159 --> 01:44:57,600
and

01:44:54,719 --> 01:44:58,560
um so with respect to according to

01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:01,199
writing code

01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:03,440
i also don't see any any relation any

01:45:01,199 --> 01:45:06,960
correlation and interdependence

01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:08,480
between the different languages and

01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:17,840
generalizations we are supporting and

01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:17,840
the code contribution

01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:33,440
so this next question being written down

01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:35,199
right now which activities did really

01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:39,360
help attract people to the project

01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:40,080
um so we just as of this year we started

01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:42,239
uh

01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:45,199
trying to quantify the success of this

01:45:42,239 --> 01:45:47,679
project okay by monitoring the

01:45:45,199 --> 01:45:49,520
um the number of downloads number of

01:45:47,679 --> 01:45:52,239
downloads and checking statistics

01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:54,000
for you know for linux distribution

01:45:52,239 --> 01:45:57,679
checking the number of downloads

01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:59,679
from from the microsoft store flat

01:45:57,679 --> 01:46:01,679
repositories and so on and so on okay so

01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:04,000
this is we are still in the process of

01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:06,000
defining metrics that we will use to

01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:07,280
quantify basically the success

01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,040
okay right now i would say so the

01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:11,679
personal impression is

01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:13,360
uh um publishing more producing more

01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:14,719
noise around your projects so publishing

01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:15,360
something on the home page you know

01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:16,960
providing

01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:19,040
additional documentation as nice

01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:21,679
examples and so on and so on this is

01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:22,159
this is what helped to attract new users

01:46:21,679 --> 01:46:23,920
and

01:46:22,159 --> 01:46:25,679
right now we measured this basically by

01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:28,320
the number of emails

01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:30,000
personal emails we get we get everybody

01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:31,840
using number of puck reports feature

01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,239
requests and so on and so on so i

01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:35,920
right now i would say the promotional

01:46:34,239 --> 01:46:39,119
promotional work we did

01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:41,520
on in the recent past

01:46:39,119 --> 01:46:43,520
uh brought us more attention more new

01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:45,440
users

01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:46,560
than the new features we released

01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:48,239
recently

01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:49,840
okay and this is the reason why i said

01:46:48,239 --> 01:46:51,679
okay so there's a certain

01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:54,080
change in the mindset happening right

01:46:51,679 --> 01:46:55,840
now where we say now okay so the

01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:57,520
level of maturity of the project is

01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:59,600
maybe good enough now

01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:01,520
and so the application is usable for

01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:02,800
many many users coming from many many

01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:05,119
different academic

01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:07,119
communities so we simply need to reach

01:47:05,119 --> 01:47:08,159
out to them to introduce the project and

01:47:07,119 --> 01:47:10,000
try to attract

01:47:08,159 --> 01:47:11,760
and track new users okay and this is

01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,800
what is happening right now so we see

01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:15,520
new users

01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:15,840
coming coming and getting contact with

01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:18,320
us

01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:20,000
so promotional work definitely is that

01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:22,000
[Music]

01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:24,320
had the heaviest impact in the recent

01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,320
past

01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:36,880
so i guess we can there are no questions

01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:39,920
so we can wrap the

01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:43,440
session here thanks

01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:45,920
thanks everybody okay now we have a

01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:51,840
small break

01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:51,840
we can we'll continue after the break

02:10:12,480 --> 02:10:18,560
hello everyone and welcome back for to

02:10:16,639 --> 02:10:21,360
the linux of summit

02:10:18,560 --> 02:10:22,159
so next on the virtual stage we have

02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:24,239
young rulik

02:10:22,159 --> 02:10:26,079
i hope to have to try the correct

02:10:24,239 --> 02:10:27,599
pronunciation sorry about it

02:10:26,079 --> 02:10:29,599
and he will give a talk about

02:10:27,599 --> 02:10:32,639
distribution of qt apps

02:10:29,599 --> 02:10:35,679
to other platforms so

02:10:32,639 --> 02:10:35,679
the end stage is yours

02:10:36,159 --> 02:10:43,840
okay uh hello everyone uh just click

02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:43,840
check if you can hear me

02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:50,560
okay perfect so hello again

02:10:47,280 --> 02:10:52,480
uh my name is jan guruli and i will talk

02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:54,480
about distribution of good apps to other

02:10:52,480 --> 02:10:56,159
platforms

02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:57,840
so first let's start with some

02:10:56,159 --> 02:11:00,480
introduction uh

02:10:57,840 --> 02:11:02,000
so i work for redhead where i'm part of

02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:04,960
the desktop team

02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:05,679
and my responsibilities there are to

02:11:04,960 --> 02:11:08,480
take care of

02:11:05,679 --> 02:11:10,960
guild and kd packages in well and

02:11:08,480 --> 02:11:13,920
besides that i also tried to include

02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:15,360
red hat's emerging technologies such as

02:11:13,920 --> 02:11:19,360
flatback or pipefire

02:11:15,360 --> 02:11:20,960
uh with kde or cute and i'm also part of

02:11:19,360 --> 02:11:23,440
fedora kdc

02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:24,800
where i occasionally package cute and

02:11:23,440 --> 02:11:28,400
kde

02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:31,280
and i'm also a big fan of kd

02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:32,400
and user and developer there for example

02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:35,280
i maintain the

02:11:32,400 --> 02:11:38,960
plasma network management upload so i

02:11:35,280 --> 02:11:41,360
contribute there as well

02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:43,280
so about this presentation so why am i

02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:46,880
giving this talk

02:11:43,280 --> 02:11:47,840
uh like a year ago i took over

02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:51,040
maintainership

02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:53,199
of federal media writer

02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:54,800
if you don't know federal media writer

02:11:53,199 --> 02:11:58,239
that's a tool

02:11:54,800 --> 02:12:01,760
we provide to users it allows them to

02:11:58,239 --> 02:12:04,480
easily download any fedora variant

02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:05,679
and write all the images to their usb

02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:07,760
drives

02:12:05,679 --> 02:12:09,199
it has a nice ui and it's available on

02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:13,280
all platforms

02:12:09,199 --> 02:12:16,000
and before that i had zero experience of

02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:17,040
building uh cute applications on mac and

02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:20,719
windows

02:12:17,040 --> 02:12:23,360
so i had to learn how to do that or

02:12:20,719 --> 02:12:24,239
the previous maintainer already had some

02:12:23,360 --> 02:12:27,119
build scripts

02:12:24,239 --> 02:12:28,320
written but i i introduced some new

02:12:27,119 --> 02:12:31,760
dependencies

02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:34,239
and i rewrote the application to cmake

02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:35,040
so i had to learn everything how to do

02:12:34,239 --> 02:12:38,800
that and

02:12:35,040 --> 02:12:41,040
update all the builds scripts

02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:43,199
to include my new dependencies and to

02:12:41,040 --> 02:12:44,719
accommodate cmake changes and things

02:12:43,199 --> 02:12:47,760
like that

02:12:44,719 --> 02:12:50,880
and it was not a really easy process

02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:53,760
to learn everything uh it sometimes may

02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:55,040
get complicated so i decided to give

02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:58,880
this talk

02:12:55,040 --> 02:13:01,199
so i will mention uh tools we use

02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:02,719
to distribute fedora media writer and to

02:13:01,199 --> 02:13:06,320
build it on windows and

02:13:02,719 --> 02:13:09,040
mac os i will give you some examples of

02:13:06,320 --> 02:13:11,520
cmake usage because that's something i

02:13:09,040 --> 02:13:14,719
learned recently

02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:16,880
during the rewrite and it's not much

02:13:14,719 --> 02:13:19,280
about linux so

02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:21,679
because i guess many of you are linux

02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:24,800
users and linux developers so you know

02:13:21,679 --> 02:13:24,800
how it works there

02:13:28,840 --> 02:13:36,239
okay so let's start with some basics so

02:13:33,119 --> 02:13:38,960
here i have just an overview of platform

02:13:36,239 --> 02:13:42,400
specific defines you can use in cmake

02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:44,480
to distinguish platform-specific code uh

02:13:42,400 --> 02:13:46,719
each of the platform defines gets

02:13:44,480 --> 02:13:50,159
defined on on the platform where you

02:13:46,719 --> 02:13:53,760
build your project so there are defines

02:13:50,159 --> 02:13:58,320
like apple win32 or unix which

02:13:53,760 --> 02:14:00,800
gets defined on each platform

02:13:58,320 --> 02:14:01,440
with unix it can be tricky because unix

02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:04,239
defined

02:14:01,440 --> 02:14:04,880
gets defined also on apple so in case

02:14:04,239 --> 02:14:07,920
you want to

02:14:04,880 --> 02:14:10,880
detect linux so i use something like

02:14:07,920 --> 02:14:13,760
unix and not iphone for example

02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:16,320
then cmego supervised uh compiler

02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:19,599
defines uh if you want to distinguish

02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:22,000
for example between mingw or microsoft

02:14:19,599 --> 02:14:25,920
digital compiler

02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:27,760
and i also include one tip for you uh

02:14:25,920 --> 02:14:29,920
because it's something that took me a

02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:31,760
while to figure out

02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:35,440
when your application for example

02:14:31,760 --> 02:14:39,199
provides a gml plugin

02:14:35,440 --> 02:14:42,560
this plugin has to be marked as a module

02:14:39,199 --> 02:14:44,000
otherwise uh guilt on windows won't be

02:14:42,560 --> 02:14:46,639
able to load it

02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:50,159
that's a window specific thing uh it's

02:14:46,639 --> 02:14:54,239
mentioned in the documentation but uh

02:14:50,159 --> 02:14:54,960
it i didn't see it before so i'm i'm i'm

02:14:54,239 --> 02:14:58,000
mentioning

02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:59,599
mentioning it here so it might because

02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:01,920
it i think it might be useful for

02:14:59,599 --> 02:15:04,400
someone

02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:05,119
and just just to complete the topic uh

02:15:04,400 --> 02:15:08,079
there are also

02:15:05,119 --> 02:15:09,679
cute defines similar to cmx support i

02:15:08,079 --> 02:15:12,159
mentioned before

02:15:09,679 --> 02:15:14,159
uh these are on the source code level on

02:15:12,159 --> 02:15:16,239
and not on the build system level

02:15:14,159 --> 02:15:17,760
uh so you can use these so to

02:15:16,239 --> 02:15:20,800
distinguish your platform

02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:21,199
like mac linux or windows and same goes

02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:24,079
for

02:15:21,199 --> 02:15:24,079
all compilers

02:15:27,040 --> 02:15:34,840
okay so now let's start uh

02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:37,679
with our first platform and that will be

02:15:34,840 --> 02:15:38,719
windows so what everything you have to

02:15:37,679 --> 02:15:42,239
do for windows

02:15:38,719 --> 02:15:44,000
first of all you might need to include a

02:15:42,239 --> 02:15:47,280
manifest file

02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:49,840
the manifest file is in form of xml file

02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:51,679
and lets you define specific needs for

02:15:49,840 --> 02:15:54,639
your application

02:15:51,679 --> 02:15:55,199
for example uh in case of fedora media

02:15:54,639 --> 02:15:58,320
writer

02:15:55,199 --> 02:16:00,560
we use this so

02:15:58,320 --> 02:16:01,840
to get some additional privileges

02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:06,239
because as i mentioned

02:16:01,840 --> 02:16:07,119
it writes the federal images to usb

02:16:06,239 --> 02:16:10,800
drive

02:16:07,119 --> 02:16:13,199
so for that we need a special permission

02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:14,960
but you can you can you can also using

02:16:13,199 --> 02:16:17,679
that you can also define

02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:18,960
another stuff like that your application

02:16:17,679 --> 02:16:22,079
is dpi aware

02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:25,520
or compatibility with other

02:16:22,079 --> 02:16:28,159
windows versions and things like that

02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:30,960
then you probably want to create an

02:16:28,159 --> 02:16:34,319
installer for your users

02:16:30,960 --> 02:16:35,200
uh because probably you don't want your

02:16:34,319 --> 02:16:37,920
users to

02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:40,319
build your application themselves and on

02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:42,319
windows the only way

02:16:40,319 --> 02:16:43,439
you can do that is to create installer

02:16:42,319 --> 02:16:47,200
for them

02:16:43,439 --> 02:16:50,319
and then you want to sign the installer

02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:51,840
otherwise when users try to install your

02:16:50,319 --> 02:16:53,920
application

02:16:51,840 --> 02:16:54,960
they will get warning it comes from

02:16:53,920 --> 02:16:58,960
unverified

02:16:54,960 --> 02:16:59,900
source so therefore

02:16:58,960 --> 02:17:03,030
we have to sign them

02:16:59,900 --> 02:17:03,030
[Music]

02:17:04,479 --> 02:17:07,679
okay let's start with the first step how

02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:11,040
to get

02:17:07,679 --> 02:17:15,519
good on windows so

02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:18,000
there are more options uh

02:17:15,519 --> 02:17:19,519
you can get a kill from the official

02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:22,399
killed installer

02:17:19,519 --> 02:17:23,519
you can download it on the official good

02:17:22,399 --> 02:17:26,840
webpage

02:17:23,519 --> 02:17:30,479
or the advantage of windows is

02:17:26,840 --> 02:17:33,679
that you can cross compile

02:17:30,479 --> 02:17:38,080
windows application on linux

02:17:33,679 --> 02:17:41,120
so you can use mingw packages

02:17:38,080 --> 02:17:44,960
and it can also make your life

02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:48,240
simple as you can do it from one place

02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:52,080
and in case you want some automated

02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:54,960
builds on github you can use

02:17:52,080 --> 02:17:57,679
this you can include this action which

02:17:54,960 --> 02:17:58,319
allows you to specify a good version you

02:17:57,679 --> 02:18:00,719
can use

02:17:58,319 --> 02:18:01,439
and the compiler you will use to build

02:18:00,719 --> 02:18:05,519
your

02:18:01,439 --> 02:18:08,559
kit application use vsd so

02:18:05,519 --> 02:18:11,840
to provide automated windows built

02:18:08,559 --> 02:18:16,399
on github

02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:16,399
okay uh so let's start

02:18:16,559 --> 02:18:23,280
with the manifest file

02:18:19,599 --> 02:18:26,240
so here i have example uh how to

02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:28,559
include the uh manifest file uh with

02:18:26,240 --> 02:18:31,519
your application

02:18:28,559 --> 02:18:31,920
uh in cmake you just use target sources

02:18:31,519 --> 02:18:35,280
uh

02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:38,800
your target name and uh path

02:18:35,280 --> 02:18:41,519
to rc file the rc file

02:18:38,800 --> 02:18:43,760
might look like this one where you

02:18:41,519 --> 02:18:46,000
specify

02:18:43,760 --> 02:18:48,000
the path or the name of the manifest

02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:49,120
file which will get included into your

02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:52,319
binary

02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:55,840
and then icon

02:18:52,319 --> 02:18:58,880
for your windows application

02:18:55,840 --> 02:19:02,719
and i think this works only for

02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:06,319
mingw compiler with the microsoft visual

02:19:02,719 --> 02:19:07,040
studio compiler or if the windows

02:19:06,319 --> 02:19:11,120
manifest

02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:11,840
matches uh the application or the target

02:19:11,120 --> 02:19:14,000
name

02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:16,559
i think it includes it automatically but

02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:20,160
i haven't tried that because we use the

02:19:16,559 --> 02:19:23,359
ming compiler

02:19:20,160 --> 02:19:26,399
in gw compiler

02:19:23,359 --> 02:19:28,240
and just to show you how the manifest

02:19:26,399 --> 02:19:30,319
file look like

02:19:28,240 --> 02:19:31,280
this is the one we use in fedoramic

02:19:30,319 --> 02:19:35,040
operator

02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:38,319
you can see we just require

02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:38,319
additional privileges

02:19:38,399 --> 02:19:41,519
for the right access

02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:52,560
and when we are talking about cmake

02:19:49,200 --> 02:19:54,880
one more tip for you this is a specific

02:19:52,560 --> 02:19:59,439
thing to windows uh

02:19:54,880 --> 02:20:03,120
when building your windows application

02:19:59,439 --> 02:20:05,600
you have to specify its win32

02:20:03,120 --> 02:20:07,520
application otherwise when you build it

02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:09,439
and start your application

02:20:07,520 --> 02:20:10,880
it will automatically open the windows

02:20:09,439 --> 02:20:13,120
terminal

02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:16,720
and that's probably also something you

02:20:13,120 --> 02:20:19,200
don't want for your users to experience

02:20:16,720 --> 02:20:21,600
so they have to wait so either in

02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:23,120
executable command you specify it's

02:20:21,600 --> 02:20:26,240
vin32 application

02:20:23,120 --> 02:20:26,640
or you can use set target properties on

02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:30,800
your

02:20:26,640 --> 02:20:33,600
target and set these properties to true

02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:33,600
there are two ways

02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:41,600
now when we we build the application

02:20:39,280 --> 02:20:42,960
we want to start preparing files for the

02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:46,160
installer

02:20:42,960 --> 02:20:48,800
on windows you basically have to bundle

02:20:46,160 --> 02:20:49,200
or include all the libraries which are

02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:52,479
not

02:20:49,200 --> 02:20:55,760
present on the standard window

02:20:52,479 --> 02:20:56,800
installation so that might that might

02:20:55,760 --> 02:21:00,240
include

02:20:56,800 --> 02:21:02,080
cute plugins qml modules or some system

02:21:00,240 --> 02:21:05,120
libraries

02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:07,760
if you're doing this manually

02:21:05,120 --> 02:21:08,240
you can but you in some cases for

02:21:07,760 --> 02:21:11,760
example

02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:14,880
in case of qml modules and good plugins

02:21:11,760 --> 02:21:15,280
you have to make sure oh they will keep

02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:18,479
their

02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:19,280
directory hierarchy otherwise you don't

02:21:18,479 --> 02:21:22,800
load them

02:21:19,280 --> 02:21:27,840
and skill libraries on system libraries

02:21:22,800 --> 02:21:29,840
can go to this to their root directory

02:21:27,840 --> 02:21:31,600
but if you don't want to do it manually

02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:33,359
uh it's probably something

02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:35,680
that's something you probably don't want

02:21:33,359 --> 02:21:39,120
uh because it's a painful process

02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:43,359
we do that for some builds uh

02:21:39,120 --> 02:21:46,800
but in github we we use uh

02:21:43,359 --> 02:21:50,479
this way you can use

02:21:46,800 --> 02:21:51,200
uh windowpoi cute that's a tool qt

02:21:50,479 --> 02:21:54,800
provides

02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:57,920
uh when you run this tool you specify

02:21:54,800 --> 02:21:59,120
qml directory and your application

02:21:57,920 --> 02:22:02,000
binary

02:21:59,120 --> 02:22:02,479
and this will automatically install all

02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:05,680
your

02:22:02,479 --> 02:22:08,720
uh skilled plugins or all good

02:22:05,680 --> 02:22:12,960
libraries and and thanks to

02:22:08,720 --> 02:22:17,600
kml import scanner

02:22:12,960 --> 02:22:20,840
it will also include all kml modules

02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:23,840
you need to bundle with their

02:22:20,840 --> 02:22:23,840
application

02:22:26,319 --> 02:22:30,880
and system libraries still might need to

02:22:29,200 --> 02:22:32,720
be copied manually because i think

02:22:30,880 --> 02:22:36,160
having the procured

02:22:32,720 --> 02:22:39,760
it's only about cute stuff so some some

02:22:36,160 --> 02:22:39,760
things still have to be done manually

02:22:40,160 --> 02:22:46,880
okay now we have all the files uh

02:22:43,840 --> 02:22:50,399
ready so you probably want to start

02:22:46,880 --> 02:22:53,359
creating your installer to create

02:22:50,399 --> 02:22:53,680
uh the window installer we use ncis it's

02:22:53,359 --> 02:22:56,240
a

02:22:53,680 --> 02:22:57,280
open source system to create windows

02:22:56,240 --> 02:23:01,040
installer

02:22:57,280 --> 02:23:02,960
it's system it's a script base and

02:23:01,040 --> 02:23:04,399
it allows you to define everything you

02:23:02,960 --> 02:23:06,720
need for the installer

02:23:04,399 --> 02:23:08,479
like files which gets installed and

02:23:06,720 --> 02:23:10,720
uninstalled or

02:23:08,479 --> 02:23:13,120
you can define the application name

02:23:10,720 --> 02:23:15,840
version link

02:23:13,120 --> 02:23:16,560
things that get gets into windows

02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:20,160
register

02:23:16,560 --> 02:23:22,880
or the shortcut to the application

02:23:20,160 --> 02:23:23,920
i don't have example how the script

02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:26,240
looked like

02:23:23,920 --> 02:23:28,000
because the one we have in fedora media

02:23:26,240 --> 02:23:30,560
right is quite long

02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:32,800
but i think with this thing it's

02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:35,359
something you probably copy from

02:23:32,800 --> 02:23:38,479
some other project and just modify it

02:23:35,359 --> 02:23:38,479
all to your needs

02:23:39,280 --> 02:23:44,800
so probably there is no reason to write

02:23:41,840 --> 02:23:44,800
this from scratch

02:23:45,280 --> 02:23:50,960
and when you have uh

02:23:49,120 --> 02:23:52,560
when you wrote the script for the

02:23:50,960 --> 02:23:55,600
installer

02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:58,640
uh you can try to generate it

02:23:55,600 --> 02:24:01,760
uh to do so you use uh

02:23:58,640 --> 02:24:06,319
makencies tool you can again

02:24:01,760 --> 02:24:09,520
get it from mink gw packages on linux

02:24:06,319 --> 02:24:11,600
or you can use chocolatey on windows

02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:12,640
chocolate is a package manager from

02:24:11,600 --> 02:24:15,280
windows

02:24:12,640 --> 02:24:17,840
so you can if you have it you can just

02:24:15,280 --> 02:24:22,160
run a choco install makenchies

02:24:17,840 --> 02:24:25,840
and you are done uh once you create

02:24:22,160 --> 02:24:28,399
the installer for windows now it's time

02:24:25,840 --> 02:24:29,920
to sign the installer to sign the

02:24:28,399 --> 02:24:33,200
installer we use

02:24:29,920 --> 02:24:37,040
ossl sign code

02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:41,200
this is again from mingw package

02:24:37,040 --> 02:24:45,120
on windows there is signed sign tool

02:24:41,200 --> 02:24:47,520
or basically a similar tool to these uh

02:24:45,120 --> 02:24:48,240
the parameters or the command is very

02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:51,280
similar

02:24:48,240 --> 02:24:51,680
so here i have example of the overseason

02:24:51,280 --> 02:24:54,840
sign

02:24:51,680 --> 02:24:56,000
code we use in case of federal media

02:24:54,840 --> 02:24:59,120
writer

02:24:56,000 --> 02:25:03,760
we design tool it's

02:24:59,120 --> 02:25:03,760
similar you specify

02:25:04,560 --> 02:25:08,399
the certificate passport password

02:25:07,439 --> 02:25:10,960
certificate

02:25:08,399 --> 02:25:12,160
or you need the timestamp and then

02:25:10,960 --> 02:25:15,359
specify

02:25:12,160 --> 02:25:15,359
path to the installer

02:25:18,880 --> 02:25:24,640
okay and now

02:25:22,720 --> 02:25:25,840
when you are done with installer it's

02:25:24,640 --> 02:25:28,880
time

02:25:25,840 --> 02:25:31,840
to try it i don't think

02:25:28,880 --> 02:25:32,880
you will manage to successfully create

02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:36,160
install

02:25:32,880 --> 02:25:38,560
for on the first try i

02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:40,800
failed many times because many times

02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:44,160
we'll find a library is missing

02:25:40,800 --> 02:25:45,040
or i don't know installer does something

02:25:44,160 --> 02:25:48,080
wrong

02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:51,120
so this is like a try

02:25:48,080 --> 02:25:54,399
and repeat process many times

02:25:51,120 --> 02:25:56,800
but if you once you've managed to

02:25:54,399 --> 02:25:58,640
do it successfully one time there's

02:25:56,800 --> 02:26:00,880
probably no reason

02:25:58,640 --> 02:26:02,560
why it shouldn't why it shouldn't work

02:26:00,880 --> 02:26:04,240
in the future unless you add some new

02:26:02,560 --> 02:26:05,840
dependencies

02:26:04,240 --> 02:26:08,160
there's probably no reason why it should

02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:08,160
break

02:26:10,479 --> 02:26:16,080
okay now it's uh time for another

02:26:12,560 --> 02:26:19,120
platform and it is mac os

02:26:16,080 --> 02:26:20,240
uh with with mac os this situation is

02:26:19,120 --> 02:26:22,960
similar

02:26:20,240 --> 02:26:25,439
but in some ways it's more complicated

02:26:22,960 --> 02:26:27,359
the signing is more complex

02:26:25,439 --> 02:26:29,680
than on windows and the main

02:26:27,359 --> 02:26:33,280
disadvantage is that you have to

02:26:29,680 --> 02:26:37,920
do all of this on macos platform

02:26:33,280 --> 02:26:42,160
there is no cross compiling from linux

02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:44,800
so you need some mac machine

02:26:42,160 --> 02:26:46,840
or probably install macos virtual

02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:48,960
machine at least

02:26:46,840 --> 02:26:50,800
or on mac os

02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:52,000
it's all about creating application

02:26:50,800 --> 02:26:55,040
bundle uh

02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:58,160
mac doesn't use installers you can

02:26:55,040 --> 02:27:00,080
you can think of it as a app image a

02:26:58,160 --> 02:27:03,120
very cheaper application

02:27:00,080 --> 02:27:03,680
together with all libraries which are

02:27:03,120 --> 02:27:05,920
not

02:27:03,680 --> 02:27:06,500
available on standard mac os

02:27:05,920 --> 02:27:07,760
installation

02:27:06,500 --> 02:27:10,080
[Music]

02:27:07,760 --> 02:27:12,000
uh steps to create the bundle are

02:27:10,080 --> 02:27:15,200
following you need to write uh

02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:15,760
info info plist file which i will

02:27:15,200 --> 02:27:18,319
describe

02:27:15,760 --> 02:27:19,359
later then you have to bundle all

02:27:18,319 --> 02:27:22,240
libraries so

02:27:19,359 --> 02:27:23,920
since this system is similar to windows

02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:26,160
and after you bundle everything

02:27:23,920 --> 02:27:28,560
uh you need to sign the binaries you

02:27:26,160 --> 02:27:32,160
need to sign the bundle itself

02:27:28,560 --> 02:27:35,520
then you create a dmg file and then

02:27:32,160 --> 02:27:36,640
uh mac has an additional step you have

02:27:35,520 --> 02:27:39,200
to send

02:27:36,640 --> 02:27:41,040
your bundle for notification i will

02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:45,040
describe all the steps

02:27:41,040 --> 02:27:48,160
more closely in next slides

02:27:45,040 --> 02:27:50,000
so again first step how you can get cute

02:27:48,160 --> 02:27:53,120
on macos

02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:57,280
what we use is home brew that's

02:27:53,120 --> 02:28:00,000
this is similar to chocolate on windows

02:27:57,280 --> 02:28:00,560
it's a package installer so in our case

02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:03,280
uh

02:28:00,560 --> 02:28:05,040
we just called brew install qt5 and blue

02:28:03,280 --> 02:28:07,439
installs you make

02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:08,399
and it will give us uh everything we

02:28:07,439 --> 02:28:10,960
need

02:28:08,399 --> 02:28:11,680
another option is to again use the

02:28:10,960 --> 02:28:14,960
official

02:28:11,680 --> 02:28:14,960
installer from good

02:28:17,359 --> 02:28:21,380
okay now we can start creating macos

02:28:20,960 --> 02:28:23,040
bundle

02:28:21,380 --> 02:28:26,640
[Music]

02:28:23,040 --> 02:28:30,880
so we start the process from cmake

02:28:26,640 --> 02:28:33,280
uh let's see make you define that your

02:28:30,880 --> 02:28:34,399
executable will be a macos bundle and

02:28:33,280 --> 02:28:36,880
you additionally

02:28:34,399 --> 02:28:38,880
can set the icon to your application

02:28:36,880 --> 02:28:42,319
that you can see on the first

02:28:38,880 --> 02:28:44,880
line then we can specify some properties

02:28:42,319 --> 02:28:46,399
uh like the uh name of them of the

02:28:44,880 --> 02:28:49,760
bundle

02:28:46,399 --> 02:28:54,640
then you specify path to info please

02:28:49,760 --> 02:28:57,520
and then specify macos deployment target

02:28:54,640 --> 02:28:58,560
and you also can specify where your

02:28:57,520 --> 02:29:01,600
where the application

02:28:58,560 --> 02:29:05,200
icon can go because the

02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:05,200
macos bundles have some

02:29:05,439 --> 02:29:12,479
directory hierarchy so

02:29:08,800 --> 02:29:15,040
so things like icons or

02:29:12,479 --> 02:29:17,520
additional resources goes into resources

02:29:15,040 --> 02:29:17,520
further

02:29:19,520 --> 02:29:24,000
so now what is the information property

02:29:22,319 --> 02:29:27,280
list

02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:27,600
uh there's a file you have to include

02:29:27,280 --> 02:29:31,120
for

02:29:27,600 --> 02:29:33,200
every every application bundle it uh

02:29:31,120 --> 02:29:35,359
basically identifies your bundle you can

02:29:33,200 --> 02:29:36,160
set their your application name your

02:29:35,359 --> 02:29:40,160
version

02:29:36,160 --> 02:29:43,840
icon or you can use your own template

02:29:40,160 --> 02:29:47,200
it doesn't need to be the one

02:29:43,840 --> 02:29:50,720
that is provided by default or by cmake

02:29:47,200 --> 02:29:52,000
the format is xml here here i have a

02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:55,439
small example

02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:58,800
you can see it's a key value based uh

02:29:55,439 --> 02:29:59,840
so specify for example the icon icon

02:29:58,800 --> 02:30:02,840
file

02:29:59,840 --> 02:30:04,080
and then the variable gets substituted

02:30:02,840 --> 02:30:07,280
from

02:30:04,080 --> 02:30:08,479
cmg defines so you can as i mentioned

02:30:07,280 --> 02:30:11,359
you can either use

02:30:08,479 --> 02:30:13,520
your own file or where you have your own

02:30:11,359 --> 02:30:15,840
application specific defines

02:30:13,520 --> 02:30:17,439
this probably that's something we use in

02:30:15,840 --> 02:30:20,880
federal media writer

02:30:17,439 --> 02:30:23,520
for example for the version we have a

02:30:20,880 --> 02:30:26,240
federal media brazil federal media

02:30:23,520 --> 02:30:28,880
writer version which gets substituted

02:30:26,240 --> 02:30:29,280
across the project but you can use the

02:30:28,880 --> 02:30:32,000
one

02:30:29,280 --> 02:30:33,600
provided by cmake but you have to know

02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:36,080
all the variables

02:30:33,600 --> 02:30:38,000
you have to define in order to properly

02:30:36,080 --> 02:30:41,600
get them substituted

02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:41,600
in the info based file

02:30:44,560 --> 02:30:51,439
okay um now at this phase

02:30:48,160 --> 02:30:54,160
uh we only have uh files

02:30:51,439 --> 02:30:55,520
or binaries which were built by our

02:30:54,160 --> 02:30:58,399
application

02:30:55,520 --> 02:31:00,880
but as i mentioned similar to windows

02:30:58,399 --> 02:31:02,960
you have to include all the libraries

02:31:00,880 --> 02:31:06,479
which are not present on standard mac

02:31:02,960 --> 02:31:09,359
installation so in this case uh

02:31:06,479 --> 02:31:11,120
we use uh make deploy kit this is

02:31:09,359 --> 02:31:14,399
similar to the windowpoke

02:31:11,120 --> 02:31:18,800
or that's basically the same here i have

02:31:14,399 --> 02:31:23,120
a example of how i use it with cmake

02:31:18,800 --> 02:31:26,399
so you can see we first search for it

02:31:23,120 --> 02:31:29,920
and then we create a custom command

02:31:26,399 --> 02:31:32,479
that calls the make deploy guild

02:31:29,920 --> 02:31:33,840
providing path uh to our application

02:31:32,479 --> 02:31:37,280
bundle

02:31:33,840 --> 02:31:40,640
path to our qml directory and

02:31:37,280 --> 02:31:40,640
application executable

02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:44,880
uh because on mac uh

02:31:45,520 --> 02:31:50,720
it's not very easy to bundle our

02:31:49,439 --> 02:31:54,080
libraries

02:31:50,720 --> 02:31:54,080
manually like on windows

02:31:55,359 --> 02:32:01,600
because uh if you if you see if you

02:31:58,399 --> 02:32:04,800
for example see this example when i call

02:32:01,600 --> 02:32:08,800
all tool on cute gui or library

02:32:04,800 --> 02:32:11,359
you can see the path to the library

02:32:08,800 --> 02:32:12,160
points somewhere to the system and if

02:32:11,359 --> 02:32:14,560
you just

02:32:12,160 --> 02:32:16,160
blindly copy this library to your

02:32:14,560 --> 02:32:19,760
application bundle

02:32:16,160 --> 02:32:22,080
it will keep pointing to the same path

02:32:19,760 --> 02:32:23,760
and when you then distribute this to the

02:32:22,080 --> 02:32:25,680
users

02:32:23,760 --> 02:32:26,880
they won't be able to load it because

02:32:25,680 --> 02:32:31,359
the path

02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:31,359
or the library on this path won't exist

02:32:31,600 --> 02:32:36,800
so if you if you

02:32:35,040 --> 02:32:39,359
if there are situations where you have

02:32:36,800 --> 02:32:42,240
to do this manually

02:32:39,359 --> 02:32:44,720
you have to change the path to the

02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:48,000
library

02:32:44,720 --> 02:32:50,319
you first copy it to the

02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:51,200
specified directory in the application

02:32:50,319 --> 02:32:53,600
bundle

02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:55,760
in this case is the name of the bundle

02:32:53,600 --> 02:32:58,479
contents and frameworks

02:32:55,760 --> 02:32:59,760
and then you have to call or install

02:32:58,479 --> 02:33:02,479
name tool

02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:03,280
that's a tool that that can that allows

02:33:02,479 --> 02:33:06,399
you to change

02:33:03,280 --> 02:33:08,640
the path to the library and

02:33:06,399 --> 02:33:09,520
if you are doing this manually for all

02:33:08,640 --> 02:33:12,319
the libraries

02:33:09,520 --> 02:33:13,120
uh it's probably not something you want

02:33:12,319 --> 02:33:16,319
to do

02:33:13,120 --> 02:33:19,520
so make the project youth will

02:33:16,319 --> 02:33:22,479
do all of that for you

02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:23,760
automatically but there are some

02:33:22,479 --> 02:33:26,399
situations where

02:33:23,760 --> 02:33:26,880
some libraries might be skipped or we

02:33:26,399 --> 02:33:28,960
have

02:33:26,880 --> 02:33:30,240
this situation with federal media writer

02:33:28,960 --> 02:33:32,479
where some library

02:33:30,240 --> 02:33:34,319
is considered as a system library and

02:33:32,479 --> 02:33:36,960
therefore it's not copied uh

02:33:34,319 --> 02:33:38,000
with mega deploy qt so we have to do

02:33:36,960 --> 02:33:40,640
this process

02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,640
manually

02:33:42,880 --> 02:33:50,960
okay now coming to signing binaries

02:33:47,600 --> 02:33:52,000
with mac as i mentioned uh there are two

02:33:50,960 --> 02:33:56,080
things so you have to

02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:58,399
sign all the binaries in the bundle

02:33:56,080 --> 02:34:00,240
that there has to be every library in

02:33:58,399 --> 02:34:03,280
the frameworks directory

02:34:00,240 --> 02:34:04,160
and then it has to be your application

02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:07,520
binaries

02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:08,479
or the executables uh these all have to

02:34:07,520 --> 02:34:11,040
be signed

02:34:08,479 --> 02:34:13,120
and then you also have to sign the

02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:16,960
bundle itself

02:34:13,120 --> 02:34:19,280
to science to sign uh your application

02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:20,800
you have you you can use a code code

02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:23,760
sign tool

02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:24,399
uh here's an example how it can be run

02:34:23,760 --> 02:34:27,600
or

02:34:24,399 --> 02:34:31,840
it can be done using make deploy guide

02:34:27,600 --> 02:34:31,840
with code sign option

02:34:32,319 --> 02:34:35,280
then when you sign

02:34:35,359 --> 02:34:38,399
your application bundle and all the

02:34:36,880 --> 02:34:41,680
binaries

02:34:38,399 --> 02:34:45,520
you have to create a dmg file a dmg file

02:34:41,680 --> 02:34:47,520
is a container for apps on mac os

02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:49,760
as i mentioned before you can think of

02:34:47,520 --> 02:34:51,760
it as an app image

02:34:49,760 --> 02:34:53,120
to create one you can use make the make

02:34:51,760 --> 02:34:56,560
deploy cute again

02:34:53,120 --> 02:34:57,840
with a dmg option or you can use a gi

02:34:56,560 --> 02:35:01,120
video

02:34:57,840 --> 02:35:05,439
the example is here also we go

02:35:01,120 --> 02:35:08,880
agi till create and specify

02:35:05,439 --> 02:35:13,680
the application panel name the output

02:35:08,880 --> 02:35:17,760
and some other parameters

02:35:13,680 --> 02:35:20,399
and then the next step is notification

02:35:17,760 --> 02:35:21,040
this is specific to macos because on

02:35:20,399 --> 02:35:23,120
windows

02:35:21,040 --> 02:35:24,840
you just sign the installer and that's

02:35:23,120 --> 02:35:27,600
it

02:35:24,840 --> 02:35:30,240
apple uh has additional step

02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:30,880
that's notarization the notarization

02:35:30,240 --> 02:35:34,080
process

02:35:30,880 --> 02:35:37,280
uh checks for any malicious code

02:35:34,080 --> 02:35:37,920
or components and also verifies whether

02:35:37,280 --> 02:35:40,880
you'll sign

02:35:37,920 --> 02:35:42,160
everything everything correctly this is

02:35:40,880 --> 02:35:44,720
done on apple servers

02:35:42,160 --> 02:35:45,359
so you send them your application bundle

02:35:44,720 --> 02:35:47,280
they will

02:35:45,359 --> 02:35:50,160
then reply you they will send you an

02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:53,040
email back with the result

02:35:50,160 --> 02:35:54,000
once again you can use make deploy

02:35:53,040 --> 02:35:57,280
killed

02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:58,640
to use to send your application to

02:35:57,280 --> 02:36:01,439
authorization

02:35:58,640 --> 02:36:03,040
or you can use xc run all tool dot

02:36:01,439 --> 02:36:09,840
rights app

02:36:03,040 --> 02:36:09,840
then again specifying some parameters

02:36:11,200 --> 02:36:18,720
uh once the notarization is complete

02:36:15,280 --> 02:36:21,359
uh you will receive back an email uh

02:36:18,720 --> 02:36:23,359
then authorization produces a ticket

02:36:21,359 --> 02:36:25,120
that tells that your app is successfully

02:36:23,359 --> 02:36:27,760
authorized

02:36:25,120 --> 02:36:29,200
then you have to include this ticket

02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:31,920
within your application

02:36:29,200 --> 02:36:34,319
also your distributed application is

02:36:31,920 --> 02:36:37,439
identified as notarized

02:36:34,319 --> 02:36:40,240
next time anyone wants to try to use it

02:36:37,439 --> 02:36:41,840
and to include the ticket in the bundle

02:36:40,240 --> 02:36:44,319
you just run

02:36:41,840 --> 02:36:45,600
exceerance stepper stepper the

02:36:44,319 --> 02:36:48,479
application name

02:36:45,600 --> 02:36:50,080
or the name of the bundle it includes

02:36:48,479 --> 02:36:52,399
the ticket

02:36:50,080 --> 02:36:54,000
and then you again create the dng file

02:36:52,399 --> 02:36:57,920
which you can finally

02:36:54,000 --> 02:37:02,319
distribute to your users at this point

02:36:57,920 --> 02:37:02,319
your application is properly signed

02:37:02,840 --> 02:37:05,840
notarized

02:37:06,960 --> 02:37:11,439
and you are done again i'll simmer the

02:37:10,319 --> 02:37:14,640
windows

02:37:11,439 --> 02:37:16,800
this probably something you won't make

02:37:14,640 --> 02:37:20,080
on first try

02:37:16,800 --> 02:37:23,280
so again this is a dry and repeat

02:37:20,080 --> 02:37:25,680
step many times but

02:37:23,280 --> 02:37:26,880
again on the once you do it one time and

02:37:25,680 --> 02:37:29,920
it works

02:37:26,880 --> 02:37:30,720
and you know you have a way how to

02:37:29,920 --> 02:37:33,359
automate it

02:37:30,720 --> 02:37:35,120
it's probably there is no reason when it

02:37:33,359 --> 02:37:36,720
should break

02:37:35,120 --> 02:37:40,560
until you introduce some new

02:37:36,720 --> 02:37:40,560
dependencies or anything like that

02:37:42,479 --> 02:37:51,120
okay and that's it

02:37:46,319 --> 02:37:51,120
uh now it's time for some questions

02:37:58,880 --> 02:38:03,600
okay i i can see some questions uh in

02:38:02,080 --> 02:38:06,319
shared notes

02:38:03,600 --> 02:38:07,600
yeah also uh there are some questions in

02:38:06,319 --> 02:38:09,280
the shared notes

02:38:07,600 --> 02:38:10,800
i'm not sure if you want me to read them

02:38:09,280 --> 02:38:13,120
for you if you can uh

02:38:10,800 --> 02:38:14,000
i can i can read them i see them okay

02:38:13,120 --> 02:38:17,280
great

02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:18,160
first question someone asking uh either

02:38:17,280 --> 02:38:20,720
of them

02:38:18,160 --> 02:38:22,960
i wrote a cute application with kirigami

02:38:20,720 --> 02:38:25,120
and k89n

02:38:22,960 --> 02:38:26,399
while i'm struggling to varying extend

02:38:25,120 --> 02:38:29,040
to create

02:38:26,399 --> 02:38:31,120
builds for non-nx platforms i'm

02:38:29,040 --> 02:38:32,319
struggling the hardest to create a build

02:38:31,120 --> 02:38:34,240
for ios

02:38:32,319 --> 02:38:36,560
i know it's possible to do since

02:38:34,240 --> 02:38:38,640
subsurface was supported to run there

02:38:36,560 --> 02:38:39,840
but i cannot find any documentation on

02:38:38,640 --> 02:38:42,240
how to do it

02:38:39,840 --> 02:38:43,920
what steps could one take to create this

02:38:42,240 --> 02:38:46,720
build

02:38:43,920 --> 02:38:47,520
okay i saw this question before my talk

02:38:46,720 --> 02:38:49,680
uh

02:38:47,520 --> 02:38:50,960
honestly i don't have any experience

02:38:49,680 --> 02:38:54,319
with ios

02:38:50,960 --> 02:38:55,200
but i would expect the build process or

02:38:54,319 --> 02:38:58,800
the bundling

02:38:55,200 --> 02:39:02,080
bundling might be similar

02:38:58,800 --> 02:39:05,120
so you probably have to bundle uh

02:39:02,080 --> 02:39:08,240
everything with your application but as

02:39:05,120 --> 02:39:10,000
far as i know on ios

02:39:08,240 --> 02:39:11,520
the only way how to distribute your

02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:14,560
application is for the

02:39:11,520 --> 02:39:17,040
app store so

02:39:14,560 --> 02:39:20,240
i have no experience how to get your

02:39:17,040 --> 02:39:20,240
application to app store

02:39:21,920 --> 02:39:27,120
okay uh second question

02:39:25,359 --> 02:39:29,040
did you obtain the certificate for

02:39:27,120 --> 02:39:32,640
signing on windows

02:39:29,040 --> 02:39:33,280
uh i myself don't have a certificate for

02:39:32,640 --> 02:39:37,280
windows

02:39:33,280 --> 02:39:40,880
or or even for mac os

02:39:37,280 --> 02:39:44,399
that's something our fedora engineering

02:39:40,880 --> 02:39:48,080
does or designing process

02:39:44,399 --> 02:39:50,800
so they have the certificates so they

02:39:48,080 --> 02:39:53,120
do the signing also the packages are

02:39:50,800 --> 02:39:53,520
built in kochi at least for the windows

02:39:53,120 --> 02:39:56,319
so

02:39:53,520 --> 02:39:57,120
build or the windows installer the

02:39:56,319 --> 02:39:59,439
package

02:39:57,120 --> 02:40:00,640
the package is built in fedora

02:39:59,439 --> 02:40:04,840
infrastructure

02:40:00,640 --> 02:40:07,840
and just gets signed with the script we

02:40:04,840 --> 02:40:07,840
provide

02:40:08,319 --> 02:40:12,359
third question how robust would you

02:40:11,040 --> 02:40:15,120
consider using

02:40:12,359 --> 02:40:16,399
cheatworks compiling windows version

02:40:15,120 --> 02:40:18,840
from linux

02:40:16,399 --> 02:40:21,439
compared to compiling natively from

02:40:18,840 --> 02:40:25,120
windows

02:40:21,439 --> 02:40:25,120
ah so

02:40:25,200 --> 02:40:28,640
i think for

02:40:28,880 --> 02:40:35,040
uh cute at least regarding cute

02:40:32,399 --> 02:40:36,399
stuff if you don't have some specific

02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:39,760
libraries

02:40:36,399 --> 02:40:42,080
i would say it's robust enough uh

02:40:39,760 --> 02:40:43,680
i think it has everything you need all

02:40:42,080 --> 02:40:46,720
the tools

02:40:43,680 --> 02:40:48,160
uh i haven't tried to actually build a

02:40:46,720 --> 02:40:51,520
federal media writer

02:40:48,160 --> 02:40:57,840
natively on windows uh vibrated natively

02:40:51,520 --> 02:40:57,840
in github ci but there we also use mingw

02:40:59,760 --> 02:41:03,760
so i i haven't hit any any any issue

02:41:02,399 --> 02:41:06,800
with me min gw

02:41:03,760 --> 02:41:09,200
or anything i would like or i would be

02:41:06,800 --> 02:41:09,200
missing

02:41:09,359 --> 02:41:13,279
at least at least for our usage

02:41:15,040 --> 02:41:19,040
another question or do you think you

02:41:16,880 --> 02:41:22,880
could use you could run

02:41:19,040 --> 02:41:26,800
vsl to vsl to run the tools instead of

02:41:22,880 --> 02:41:26,800
mingy on windows

02:41:28,560 --> 02:41:33,040
i honestly don't know what bsl is

02:41:42,840 --> 02:41:45,840
so

02:41:46,800 --> 02:41:51,760
uh yes uh i think

02:41:49,920 --> 02:41:53,279
as i mentioned for example for the

02:41:51,760 --> 02:41:56,479
signing uh

02:41:53,279 --> 02:41:59,040
there are alternatives there was a talk

02:41:56,479 --> 02:42:01,520
on thursday a similar torque to these

02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:04,640
advantages so

02:42:01,520 --> 02:42:06,880
they didn't go that deep they use

02:42:04,640 --> 02:42:08,319
the sign tool for example for windows

02:42:06,880 --> 02:42:11,520
signing

02:42:08,319 --> 02:42:15,120
they didn't use the mingy

02:42:11,520 --> 02:42:18,560
version so yeah

02:42:15,120 --> 02:42:21,840
all of this can be done using on native

02:42:18,560 --> 02:42:21,840
windows tools

02:42:22,960 --> 02:42:27,200
have you tried another question uh have

02:42:25,439 --> 02:42:29,439
you tried uploading your app to the

02:42:27,200 --> 02:42:32,720
apple and windows app stores

02:42:29,439 --> 02:42:36,479
uh i have not uh

02:42:32,720 --> 02:42:38,240
the only official way how we now provide

02:42:36,479 --> 02:42:42,880
a federal media writer is

02:42:38,240 --> 02:42:46,160
for the get fedora.org webpage

02:42:42,880 --> 02:42:48,000
i i almost checked

02:42:46,160 --> 02:42:50,160
how to get your application on windows

02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:53,359
store i don't think the process

02:42:50,160 --> 02:42:56,000
is easy because

02:42:53,359 --> 02:42:57,120
i saw that there were many steps in

02:42:56,000 --> 02:43:00,399
order to

02:42:57,120 --> 02:43:00,880
get their application there and that's

02:43:00,399 --> 02:43:04,319
probably

02:43:00,880 --> 02:43:04,319
not worth the time

02:43:05,920 --> 02:43:10,399
at least in this case accelerator i

02:43:08,399 --> 02:43:12,200
think although

02:43:10,399 --> 02:43:13,520
the way how we provide it or the

02:43:12,200 --> 02:43:16,640
discoverability

02:43:13,520 --> 02:43:23,840
on the getfederal.org page is

02:43:16,640 --> 02:43:23,840
enough for our use case

02:43:45,200 --> 02:43:51,120
oh i i think i'm

02:43:48,399 --> 02:43:53,040
got the fourth question wrong uh the

02:43:51,120 --> 02:43:56,000
window subsystem for linux uh

02:43:53,040 --> 02:43:57,920
that's the yeah they're running linux on

02:43:56,000 --> 02:44:01,120
on windows

02:43:57,920 --> 02:44:02,160
yeah that's that's probably something

02:44:01,120 --> 02:44:06,640
that

02:44:02,160 --> 02:44:06,640
that can be run instead of mingw

02:44:11,520 --> 02:44:19,840
okay i haven't tried yet

02:44:23,120 --> 02:44:26,720
right given that there is still some

02:44:24,800 --> 02:44:29,840
time left maybe we can wait a few more

02:44:26,720 --> 02:44:31,920
minutes if someone asks us questions

02:44:29,840 --> 02:44:47,840
if you have please add them in the

02:44:31,920 --> 02:44:47,840
shared notes

02:44:58,840 --> 02:45:01,840
happened

02:45:07,680 --> 02:45:13,040
if you if you decide

02:45:11,120 --> 02:45:15,600
to build your application windows and

02:45:13,040 --> 02:45:19,200
make uh i think you can you can check

02:45:15,600 --> 02:45:22,160
uh how we do that in federal dive writer

02:45:19,200 --> 02:45:23,600
uh all the examples i mentioned here are

02:45:22,160 --> 02:45:26,319
from there

02:45:23,600 --> 02:45:28,319
so you can you can see how we do it uh

02:45:26,319 --> 02:45:31,920
you can see how we built it in

02:45:28,319 --> 02:45:35,439
our github ci for example

02:45:31,920 --> 02:45:35,439
that that can be also helpful

02:45:35,680 --> 02:45:43,359
we built inferior in github ci we built

02:45:39,760 --> 02:45:46,240
only on-site binaries or the sign

02:45:43,359 --> 02:45:48,640
designing as i said is done by federal

02:45:46,240 --> 02:45:51,120
engineering

02:45:48,640 --> 02:45:52,319
but you can you can even there you can

02:45:51,120 --> 02:45:56,399
see the

02:45:52,319 --> 02:45:56,720
scripts we use for signing so you can

02:45:56,399 --> 02:46:11,840
check

02:45:56,720 --> 02:46:11,840
check it there and get some examples

02:46:23,120 --> 02:46:26,800
yeah there's there's another question uh

02:46:24,880 --> 02:46:28,240
have you seen the talk done by dan and

02:46:26,800 --> 02:46:31,760
ariana on friday

02:46:28,240 --> 02:46:35,120
yeah i saw it uh i i mentioned it

02:46:31,760 --> 02:46:37,760
during uh been answering um

02:46:35,120 --> 02:46:40,720
one of the questions yeah it was a it

02:46:37,760 --> 02:46:44,160
was a great talk uh

02:46:40,720 --> 02:46:47,279
they also built uh their their

02:46:44,160 --> 02:46:48,240
uh they also used github ci to produce

02:46:47,279 --> 02:46:50,800
builds

02:46:48,240 --> 02:46:51,680
it was for me it was interesting to

02:46:50,800 --> 02:46:54,880
learn

02:46:51,680 --> 02:46:55,760
how to do the signing there and keep the

02:46:54,880 --> 02:46:59,520
certificates

02:46:55,760 --> 02:47:03,200
in private that's that was a

02:46:59,520 --> 02:47:06,399
useful thing to know uh still

02:47:03,200 --> 02:47:07,279
designing because it's done by federal

02:47:06,399 --> 02:47:08,960
engineering

02:47:07,279 --> 02:47:10,960
i probably won't have access to

02:47:08,960 --> 02:47:12,960
certificates but

02:47:10,960 --> 02:47:14,960
it might be useful in future if you

02:47:12,960 --> 02:47:17,359
decide to

02:47:14,960 --> 02:47:18,960
somehow automate the builds and

02:47:17,359 --> 02:47:21,359
designing

02:47:18,960 --> 02:47:22,800
because right now i have to open ticket

02:47:21,359 --> 02:47:24,960
for them and

02:47:22,800 --> 02:47:35,840
ask them to do the signing to sign the

02:47:24,960 --> 02:47:35,840
bills i produced

02:47:41,760 --> 02:47:44,960
so if there are no more questions i

02:47:43,439 --> 02:47:47,040
guess we can thank

02:47:44,960 --> 02:47:48,479
jan for this talk thank you very much

02:47:47,040 --> 02:47:49,920
very very interesting and also

02:47:48,479 --> 02:47:52,319
for taking time to reply to all the

02:47:49,920 --> 02:47:52,319
questions

02:47:56,160 --> 02:47:59,359
i just want to say thank you for

02:47:57,600 --> 02:48:02,880
listening

root ikea i hope i could turn it right

02:55:55,600 --> 02:56:00,160
with earth talk contributing beyond code

02:56:01,120 --> 02:56:05,359
for our attendees please be reminded to

02:56:03,120 --> 02:56:06,000
ask your question in the shared notes so

02:56:05,359 --> 02:56:07,520
that we

02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:10,160
can read them at the end of the

02:56:07,520 --> 02:56:10,160
presentation

02:56:10,399 --> 02:56:15,040
let's give our speaker a few seconds to

i'm also a part of github program

02:58:36,160 --> 02:58:39,439
and about not putting my video because

02:58:39,200 --> 02:58:42,880
of

02:58:39,439 --> 02:58:44,960
connection issues my bandwidth i have to

so yeah

02:58:55,200 --> 02:58:58,640
okay so um in today's talk i'm going to

be

02:58:58,640 --> 02:59:03,120
taking you through um my open source

02:59:01,840 --> 02:59:06,080
career ladder path

02:59:03,120 --> 02:59:08,160
um and challenges i encounter during

02:59:06,080 --> 02:59:10,880
contributing to open source

02:59:08,160 --> 02:59:13,200
and you know what sparked my interest in

02:59:10,880 --> 02:59:16,399
you know while contributing and also

02:59:13,200 --> 02:59:19,040
how you can you know help um other

02:59:16,399 --> 02:59:21,040
newcomers and open source contributors

02:59:19,040 --> 02:59:22,720
and non-code contributors because today

02:59:21,040 --> 02:59:25,760
like i'm going to be focusing

02:59:22,720 --> 02:59:29,120
on non-code contributions right so

uh it's less than a year that i started

02:59:48,640 --> 02:59:52,640
doing open source contributions i

02:59:50,479 --> 02:59:57,040
started doing open source contributions

02:59:52,640 --> 03:00:00,240
three months into my coding journey

02:59:57,040 --> 03:00:03,040
at july so i'm going to be taking you

03:00:00,240 --> 03:00:04,240
through the story of all my open source

03:00:03,040 --> 03:00:07,279
contributions with

03:00:04,240 --> 03:00:11,840
the gnome foundation and i hope you

enjoy my story

03:00:12,960 --> 03:00:20,080
so yeah uh i started my open source

03:00:16,800 --> 03:00:21,040

challenge so a quick context on what uh

03:00:24,240 --> 03:00:29,439
women of open source

03:00:25,840 --> 03:00:30,080

03:00:29,439 --> 03:00:33,040
africa

03:00:30,080 --> 03:00:35,040
is an initiative by the open source

03:00:33,040 --> 03:00:38,319
community here in africa

03:00:35,040 --> 03:00:41,200
and another another group called the

03:00:38,319 --> 03:00:42,720
another ngo called she called africa

03:00:41,200 --> 03:00:45,600
that is about you know

um contributing to the success of

03:00:45,600 --> 03:00:49,840
african women

03:00:46,800 --> 03:00:52,640
in um in tech so

03:00:49,840 --> 03:00:53,439
there's the initiative came about in

03:00:52,640 --> 03:00:57,520
july

03:00:53,439 --> 03:01:00,720
um just launched in july um to you know

03:00:57,520 --> 03:01:02,000
make more women in in africa contribute

03:01:00,720 --> 03:01:03,760
to open source

03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:05,040
right so there was the launch there was

03:01:03,760 --> 03:01:07,040
a launch of the

03:01:05,040 --> 03:01:08,800
program of the initiative and you know

03:01:07,040 --> 03:01:12,000
there was like a little

03:01:08,800 --> 03:01:13,040
workshop to get you to contribute um

03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:16,880
give your first

03:01:13,040 --> 03:01:18,800
open source contribution and i was three

03:01:16,880 --> 03:01:21,279
months into coding then

03:01:18,800 --> 03:01:23,200
um i i have a microbiology degree i

03:01:21,279 --> 03:01:27,200
transitioned from microbiology

03:01:23,200 --> 03:01:30,399
to doing tech so i was three months into

03:01:27,200 --> 03:01:32,960
country into coding and i said okay open

03:01:30,399 --> 03:01:34,080
source seems like a good thing for me to

03:01:32,960 --> 03:01:36,319
start on with

03:01:34,080 --> 03:01:38,080
and before now i'm also like a social

03:01:36,319 --> 03:01:41,040
volunteer so volunteering has been

03:01:38,080 --> 03:01:43,600
something i am really passionate about

03:01:41,040 --> 03:01:44,640
so i said okay i'm going to attend this

03:01:43,600 --> 03:01:48,240
uh i'm going to

03:01:44,640 --> 03:01:50,560
attend this um this um launch

03:01:48,240 --> 03:01:51,920
for uh woost car that's women of open

03:01:50,560 --> 03:01:54,240
source africa

03:01:51,920 --> 03:01:54,960
so i attended the launch i i think i

03:01:54,240 --> 03:01:57,200
attended

03:01:54,960 --> 03:01:59,439
late and you know during the workshop i

03:01:57,200 --> 03:02:02,479
said okay let me give it a try

03:01:59,439 --> 03:02:04,080
and we used um the first contributions

03:02:02,479 --> 03:02:06,319
um repository the

03:02:04,080 --> 03:02:07,920
one of the popular first repositories

03:02:06,319 --> 03:02:09,600
people do their first open source

03:02:07,920 --> 03:02:13,040
contributions with

03:02:09,600 --> 03:02:15,279
so we use the first um we use the first

03:02:13,040 --> 03:02:18,560
contributions repository to do a

03:02:15,279 --> 03:02:20,399
practice for the workshop and you know i

03:02:18,560 --> 03:02:21,200
was struggling because i was trying to

03:02:20,399 --> 03:02:23,600
you know get i

03:02:21,200 --> 03:02:25,520
had never used it before that was like

03:02:23,600 --> 03:02:27,040
my first good experience i'm going to

03:02:25,520 --> 03:02:28,000
tell you about my challenges with it

03:02:27,040 --> 03:02:32,000
later on

03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:34,479
during the session so uh i have um

03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:36,240
never used gates before and we are

03:02:34,479 --> 03:02:38,240
supposed to use git i had to you know

03:02:36,240 --> 03:02:40,479
download git on my system

03:02:38,240 --> 03:02:42,479
and try to follow up with the conference

03:02:40,479 --> 03:02:45,520
i was even jotting down

03:02:42,479 --> 03:02:46,000
while the um speaker was trying to help

03:02:45,520 --> 03:02:49,680
us

03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:51,920
set up git and everything and

03:02:49,680 --> 03:02:53,840
i didn't even know how i made this

03:02:51,920 --> 03:02:55,120
contribution you can see this is a

03:02:53,840 --> 03:02:58,479
screenshot

03:02:55,120 --> 03:03:01,760
of a tweet i made um

03:02:58,479 --> 03:03:03,920
after making the the poo and my pull

03:03:01,760 --> 03:03:05,920
request was merged after making the pull

03:03:03,920 --> 03:03:07,200
request to add my name to the first

03:03:05,920 --> 03:03:10,319
contributions

03:03:07,200 --> 03:03:12,720
so i immediately tweeted about this um

03:03:10,319 --> 03:03:14,800
after i was able to you know send in a

03:03:12,720 --> 03:03:17,840
pull request for the first time

03:03:14,800 --> 03:03:19,040
and it got so many engagements like you

03:03:17,840 --> 03:03:22,960
can see here

03:03:19,040 --> 03:03:26,080
i had over 200 likes on on on this

03:03:22,960 --> 03:03:28,080
um of people telling me congratulations

03:03:26,080 --> 03:03:29,359
for making your first open source

03:03:28,080 --> 03:03:31,840
contribution

03:03:29,359 --> 03:03:34,240
and you know i was so happy because i

03:03:31,840 --> 03:03:37,200
just basically added my name

03:03:34,240 --> 03:03:37,680
to i just basically added my name to the

03:03:37,200 --> 03:03:40,439
um

03:03:37,680 --> 03:03:41,840
contributors list and people were saying

03:03:40,439 --> 03:03:45,359
congratulations and

03:03:41,840 --> 03:03:48,560
it was it was so nice and i said okay

03:03:45,359 --> 03:03:52,240
i think that i i want to keep doing this

03:03:48,560 --> 03:03:54,080
and fortunately um women of open south

03:03:52,240 --> 03:03:56,080
africa had a challenge

03:03:54,080 --> 03:03:57,439
in the month of july that was starting

03:03:56,080 --> 03:04:00,560
in the month of july

03:03:57,439 --> 03:04:02,720
so it's similar to the um

03:04:00,560 --> 03:04:04,080
october 1st challenge you know where you

03:04:02,720 --> 03:04:07,120
get the the

03:04:04,080 --> 03:04:10,240
the um the criteria was get

03:04:07,120 --> 03:04:12,479
a good amount of pull requests made to

03:04:10,240 --> 03:04:15,279
contribute to different organizations

03:04:12,479 --> 03:04:16,640
and you're going to get a price so in

03:04:15,279 --> 03:04:20,560
the month of july

03:04:16,640 --> 03:04:23,600
i put my heads down to start looking for

03:04:20,560 --> 03:04:24,399
open source organizations that i could i

03:04:23,600 --> 03:04:27,840
could um

03:04:24,399 --> 03:04:30,080
start contributing to and

03:04:27,840 --> 03:04:31,840
it was it was like it was really very

03:04:30,080 --> 03:04:34,960
hard for me at first because

03:04:31,840 --> 03:04:36,960
i just used git for the first time and

03:04:34,960 --> 03:04:38,000
i'm somebody that is very very

03:04:36,960 --> 03:04:41,359
inquisitive

03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:41,840
so i was like okay how am i going to

03:04:41,359 --> 03:04:44,880
start

03:04:41,840 --> 03:04:45,760
finding projects that i would contribute

03:04:44,880 --> 03:04:51,840
to

03:04:45,760 --> 03:04:51,840
so let's go to how i found no projects

03:04:52,399 --> 03:04:55,920
so i want to take you through my

03:04:54,439 --> 03:04:58,640
engagement room

03:04:55,920 --> 03:05:00,560
but first i'll pause here and say thank

03:04:58,640 --> 03:05:04,160
you so much to sri

03:05:00,560 --> 03:05:07,200

very helpful with me finding the

03:05:32,640 --> 03:05:37,040
loan project and start my first

03:05:35,760 --> 03:05:40,479
contributions

03:05:37,040 --> 03:05:40,479
with the gnome project

03:05:44,560 --> 03:05:53,040
so i was um i was just three months into

03:05:49,120 --> 03:05:56,319
coding i was taking a python classes

03:05:53,040 --> 03:05:59,200
self learning by myself i

03:05:56,319 --> 03:06:01,920
tried to um i was looking for projects i

03:05:59,200 --> 03:06:05,520
could get involved with

03:06:01,920 --> 03:06:07,040
and then um at that time um the scalable

03:06:05,520 --> 03:06:10,560
onboarding project

03:06:07,040 --> 03:06:13,760
led by sri was ongoing and

03:06:10,560 --> 03:06:16,560
i joined the jitsu room first like that

03:06:13,760 --> 03:06:20,000
was my first time together about gtc

03:06:16,560 --> 03:06:23,279
i i only knew about google meets and

03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:26,960
zoom but when i joined the gtc

03:06:23,279 --> 03:06:29,600
room or on the first day of the meeting

03:06:26,960 --> 03:06:30,399
i just started i just stayed quiet to

03:06:29,600 --> 03:06:33,600
listen to

03:06:30,399 --> 03:06:36,640
everything i felt lost but then

03:06:33,600 --> 03:06:38,960
i had some courage um because

03:06:36,640 --> 03:06:40,160
you know they were willing to hear my

03:06:38,960 --> 03:06:42,960
opinions

03:06:40,160 --> 03:06:44,399
i was coming into the the call for the

03:06:42,960 --> 03:06:47,520
first time

03:06:44,399 --> 03:06:50,160
and they asked for my opinions and

03:06:47,520 --> 03:06:52,000
they wanted to know what i thought about

03:06:50,160 --> 03:06:53,279
the project or they were questioned and

03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:56,479
i tried also

03:06:53,279 --> 03:07:00,080
to give my opinions right and

03:06:56,479 --> 03:07:00,560
then i i was told we're going to be

03:07:00,080 --> 03:07:04,319
using

03:07:00,560 --> 03:07:05,279
gitlab and i was only conversant with

03:07:04,319 --> 03:07:09,200
github

03:07:05,279 --> 03:07:12,640
because remember i was three months into

03:07:09,200 --> 03:07:16,000
my coding journey so i said okay

03:07:12,640 --> 03:07:19,680
um i think i would have to make i saw um

03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:23,359
i saw a a change um on the

03:07:19,680 --> 03:07:26,640
change was needed on the weekly

03:07:23,359 --> 03:07:28,640
um so i was like okay i can i can make

03:07:26,640 --> 03:07:31,760
this change and remember i was

03:07:28,640 --> 03:07:35,439
on the most car challenge right i was

03:07:31,760 --> 03:07:38,560
uh i had to get some pull requests

03:07:35,439 --> 03:07:40,880
by the end of july so i needed to start

03:07:38,560 --> 03:07:43,520
making my contributions and i saw that

03:07:40,880 --> 03:07:44,479
the scalable onboarding project on

03:07:43,520 --> 03:07:47,760
gitlab

03:07:44,479 --> 03:07:50,240
it had a readme fix to be fixed and i

03:07:47,760 --> 03:07:51,200
said okay let me try to contribute to

03:07:50,240 --> 03:07:54,640
this project by

03:07:51,200 --> 03:07:58,240
changing the typos on the readme

03:07:54,640 --> 03:08:02,160
and making my first contribution was

03:07:58,240 --> 03:08:05,200
a was an interesting and

03:08:02,160 --> 03:08:08,560
a frustrating one because i

03:08:05,200 --> 03:08:11,920
struggled with gifts and ssh

03:08:08,560 --> 03:08:14,080
like i i remember there was a particular

03:08:11,920 --> 03:08:17,200

setting up ssh and

03:08:32,720 --> 03:08:39,200
all the other things but you know um

03:08:44,319 --> 03:08:48,080
it was having so many errors and i tried

03:08:47,120 --> 03:08:51,120
again the second

03:08:48,080 --> 03:08:53,760
day and it went through so basically

03:08:51,120 --> 03:08:56,319
after making those with me changes i

03:08:53,760 --> 03:08:57,439
got involved with the calls and trying

03:08:56,319 --> 03:09:00,000
to set up

03:08:57,439 --> 03:09:00,720
this project so the scalable onboarding

03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:03,600
project

03:09:00,720 --> 03:09:04,560
is basically how do we make onboarding

03:09:03,600 --> 03:09:06,960
scalable

03:09:04,560 --> 03:09:07,920
how do we improve the operating system

03:09:06,960 --> 03:09:11,520
in norm

03:09:07,920 --> 03:09:13,359
so we're trying to um you know set up

03:09:11,520 --> 03:09:16,240
all those so i was

03:09:13,359 --> 03:09:16,880
fully involved with this project another

03:09:16,240 --> 03:09:20,239
project

03:09:16,880 --> 03:09:20,880
that i you know engaged with was the

03:09:20,239 --> 03:09:23,520
faces

03:09:20,880 --> 03:09:24,560
of no so um the first thing i've known

03:09:23,520 --> 03:09:27,840
was a website

03:09:24,560 --> 03:09:30,239
like appreciate um to appreciate um

03:09:27,840 --> 03:09:31,120
the loan contributors know foundation

03:09:30,239 --> 03:09:34,880
members

03:09:31,120 --> 03:09:37,840
and i tried you know i tried to

03:09:34,880 --> 03:09:40,080
do some overhaul on the on the

03:09:37,840 --> 03:09:41,040
documentation and seeing things i could

03:09:40,080 --> 03:09:43,840
improve

03:09:41,040 --> 03:09:44,720
then also another project that i'm also

03:09:43,840 --> 03:09:48,239
proud to be

03:09:44,720 --> 03:09:49,279
part of is the extensions rebooted

03:09:48,239 --> 03:09:52,560
initiative

03:09:49,279 --> 03:09:55,359
so um we are trying to make the

03:09:52,560 --> 03:09:57,439
extensions no extensions you know trying

03:09:55,359 --> 03:09:58,239
to create a conversation between the

03:09:57,439 --> 03:10:01,840
genome

03:09:58,239 --> 03:10:02,560
um developers and extension developers

03:10:01,840 --> 03:10:05,920
so that at

03:10:02,560 --> 03:10:08,800
every release um their extensions

03:10:05,920 --> 03:10:10,239
no extension would not break so all

03:10:08,800 --> 03:10:13,840
these projects that

03:10:10,239 --> 03:10:14,239
listed are listed here even though i was

03:10:13,840 --> 03:10:17,359
not

03:10:14,239 --> 03:10:19,760
able to you know i was still finding my

03:10:17,359 --> 03:10:22,399
way around coding i was still

03:10:19,760 --> 03:10:23,279
able to meaningfully contribute to these

03:10:22,399 --> 03:10:26,560
projects

03:10:23,279 --> 03:10:28,239
i was able to write um on the extensions

03:10:26,560 --> 03:10:31,359
rebooted initiative

03:10:28,239 --> 03:10:34,880
i i was able to you know write um

03:10:31,359 --> 03:10:37,479
a blog post with um together with sri

03:10:34,880 --> 03:10:38,640
and you know i was able to look at the

03:10:37,479 --> 03:10:42,000
documentation

03:10:38,640 --> 03:10:42,960
and do try to see what i can do to make

03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:45,600
it better

03:10:42,960 --> 03:10:46,080
so it goes beyond saying that open

03:10:45,600 --> 03:10:50,800
source

03:10:46,080 --> 03:10:50,800
is more than code right

03:10:52,080 --> 03:10:55,840
so let's

03:10:56,080 --> 03:11:00,720
so let me talk about my challenges

03:10:58,560 --> 03:11:03,040
during contributing

03:11:00,720 --> 03:11:04,479
because you know for non-code

03:11:03,040 --> 03:11:09,840
contributors

03:11:04,479 --> 03:11:09,840
there are so many challenges

03:11:11,920 --> 03:11:17,040
so there are so many um challenges that

03:11:14,479 --> 03:11:19,040
i encountered even though it was a very

03:11:17,040 --> 03:11:19,680
good journey for me even though it was

03:11:19,040 --> 03:11:22,800
really

03:11:19,680 --> 03:11:23,359
very sweet and very interesting let me

03:11:22,800 --> 03:11:25,680
tell you

03:11:23,359 --> 03:11:28,560
about the challenges i encountered

03:11:25,680 --> 03:11:28,560
contributing

03:11:31,600 --> 03:11:35,520
so let's talk about my technical

03:11:33,760 --> 03:11:38,560
difficulties

03:11:35,520 --> 03:11:39,439
so i told you earlier that i had some

03:11:38,560 --> 03:11:42,800
very

03:11:39,439 --> 03:11:45,439
very very crazy issues with kids

03:11:42,800 --> 03:11:46,080
so i was using git for the first time

03:11:45,439 --> 03:11:48,479
and

03:11:46,080 --> 03:11:50,080
i think you know over time over the

03:11:48,479 --> 03:11:53,760
period of one year

03:11:50,080 --> 03:11:57,279
i would say everybody has these problems

03:11:53,760 --> 03:12:00,239
because till today

03:11:57,279 --> 03:12:01,520
i still have my issues with kids but

03:12:00,239 --> 03:12:04,479
then starting was a

03:12:01,520 --> 03:12:05,600
whole lot but a whole lot more difficult

03:12:04,479 --> 03:12:09,120
because

03:12:05,600 --> 03:12:12,399
i was just getting started and it

03:12:09,120 --> 03:12:14,319
was a whole lot for me but then with you

03:12:12,399 --> 03:12:17,359
know trying to be consistent

03:12:14,319 --> 03:12:20,560
and with help i got from the community

03:12:17,359 --> 03:12:23,920
i got better with using git now

03:12:20,560 --> 03:12:26,319
another technical difficulty i faced

03:12:23,920 --> 03:12:27,200
was you know installing and setting up

03:12:26,319 --> 03:12:30,479
you know

03:12:27,200 --> 03:12:33,680
i use a windows operating system

03:12:30,479 --> 03:12:34,319
so you'll know finding how to set up and

03:12:33,680 --> 03:12:37,439
install

03:12:34,319 --> 03:12:39,760
was a big problem for me it was so

03:12:37,439 --> 03:12:42,080
difficult for me i know there were times

03:12:39,760 --> 03:12:44,000
where i i had to read a lot of dogs i

03:12:42,080 --> 03:12:47,040
had to do a lot of things

03:12:44,000 --> 03:12:47,760
and then network bandwidth here in my

03:12:47,040 --> 03:12:50,960
country

03:12:47,760 --> 03:12:54,560
sometimes most times network is quite

03:12:50,960 --> 03:12:56,160
very poor so joining the meetings i had

03:12:54,560 --> 03:12:58,720
to you know

03:12:56,160 --> 03:12:59,520
sometimes i would try to speak and there

03:12:58,720 --> 03:13:02,319
wouldn't be

03:12:59,520 --> 03:13:04,479
nobody would be able to hear me because

03:13:02,319 --> 03:13:06,720
my network was quite poor

03:13:04,479 --> 03:13:07,840
and that was that's like an issue that

03:13:06,720 --> 03:13:09,760
you know

03:13:07,840 --> 03:13:11,040
most people that it's not like we are

03:13:09,760 --> 03:13:14,160
not able to get

03:13:11,040 --> 03:13:17,279
good and better internet

03:13:14,160 --> 03:13:18,000
um you you get to face this next network

03:13:17,279 --> 03:13:21,840
bandwidth

03:13:18,000 --> 03:13:22,479
issues right and also i had electricity

03:13:21,840 --> 03:13:24,720
issues

03:13:22,479 --> 03:13:27,520
there were some times where i needed to

03:13:24,720 --> 03:13:30,800
work with my laptop but i did not have

03:13:27,520 --> 03:13:33,359
um power to you know power my laptop so

03:13:30,800 --> 03:13:36,000
sometimes it delayed my contributions

03:13:33,359 --> 03:13:38,000
and also my communications and also

03:13:36,000 --> 03:13:41,520
sometimes it could delay

03:13:38,000 --> 03:13:45,680
my enthusiasm to continue but then

03:13:41,520 --> 03:13:45,680
happily i still pushed forward

03:13:48,160 --> 03:13:55,040
so communication difficulties

03:13:51,439 --> 03:13:56,319
now um i am from africa and i'm from

03:13:55,040 --> 03:13:59,439
nigeria so

03:13:56,319 --> 03:14:02,000
i had the accent trying to hear

03:13:59,439 --> 03:14:05,279
when someone else is speaking was quite

03:14:02,000 --> 03:14:07,520
hard for me even when i tried to speak

03:14:05,279 --> 03:14:08,560
also sometimes i would have to repeat

03:14:07,520 --> 03:14:11,600
myself

03:14:08,560 --> 03:14:13,520
over and over again for you know the

03:14:11,600 --> 03:14:16,319
other person to hear me

03:14:13,520 --> 03:14:17,200
and it's not it's not much it's not um

03:14:16,319 --> 03:14:20,160
it's normal

03:14:17,200 --> 03:14:22,239
because you know essence differs so you

03:14:20,160 --> 03:14:24,160
know i had to battle with a whole lot of

03:14:22,239 --> 03:14:26,319
this but i had to try

03:14:24,160 --> 03:14:27,439
talking because i am somebody that talks

03:14:26,319 --> 03:14:30,560
really fast

03:14:27,439 --> 03:14:33,920
so i have to try and paste in my words

03:14:30,560 --> 03:14:37,279
i had to talk slowly so the other person

03:14:33,920 --> 03:14:39,920
would be able to clearly hear me

03:14:37,279 --> 03:14:42,800
so there were also difficulties with me

03:14:39,920 --> 03:14:46,160
understanding technical and social terms

03:14:42,800 --> 03:14:49,439
that were unique to the gnome project so

03:14:46,160 --> 03:14:51,920
if during um on the rocket chat

03:14:49,439 --> 03:14:52,880
or on the chat channel someone is

03:14:51,920 --> 03:14:54,800
talking about

03:14:52,880 --> 03:14:56,800
something that you know i was not

03:14:54,800 --> 03:14:59,600
conversants with

03:14:56,800 --> 03:15:01,920
it it was like it was hard for me to

03:14:59,600 --> 03:15:03,200
understand these terms because i was

03:15:01,920 --> 03:15:06,080
just starting

03:15:03,200 --> 03:15:08,160
so i also had slack in communication

03:15:06,080 --> 03:15:11,920
like with time zones right

03:15:08,160 --> 03:15:14,720
so initially when i started

03:15:11,920 --> 03:15:17,040
initially when i started um i did not

03:15:14,720 --> 03:15:19,040
understand the time zone difference

03:15:17,040 --> 03:15:21,120
so when i would send a message and you

03:15:19,040 --> 03:15:24,319
know there was no response in like

03:15:21,120 --> 03:15:26,960
five hours i was like oh is this person

03:15:24,319 --> 03:15:27,520
did this person not get my message but

03:15:26,960 --> 03:15:30,319
then

03:15:27,520 --> 03:15:32,319
later on i got to understand that you

03:15:30,319 --> 03:15:35,760
know that time zones differ

03:15:32,319 --> 03:15:36,560
and it's it can be night time at the

03:15:35,760 --> 03:15:40,000
other end

03:15:36,560 --> 03:15:40,000
of the world right

03:15:44,800 --> 03:15:48,960
so now i have talked about my

03:15:47,359 --> 03:15:52,200
difficulties

03:15:48,960 --> 03:15:55,120
i want to tell you about what i loved

03:15:52,200 --> 03:16:03,120
contributing not just contributing code

03:15:55,120 --> 03:16:06,880
but contributing beyond code

03:16:03,120 --> 03:16:07,200
the community it's there is so much to

03:16:06,880 --> 03:16:10,880
be

03:16:07,200 --> 03:16:14,840
done in the community i saw

03:16:10,880 --> 03:16:16,319
beyond the software right i saw beyond

03:16:14,840 --> 03:16:18,640
because um

03:16:16,319 --> 03:16:19,600
you know i saw people trying to

03:16:18,640 --> 03:16:23,680
understand

03:16:19,600 --> 03:16:26,720
the software i saw i saw beyond um

03:16:23,680 --> 03:16:28,160
beyond code and was able to contribute

03:16:26,720 --> 03:16:30,560
to the community

03:16:28,160 --> 03:16:31,600
helping the community management help

03:16:30,560 --> 03:16:34,000
with or even

03:16:31,600 --> 03:16:36,720
not just with them but with other

03:16:34,000 --> 03:16:37,279
organizations that i actively contribute

03:16:36,720 --> 03:16:40,560
to

03:16:37,279 --> 03:16:42,960
i was part of the community management i

03:16:40,560 --> 03:16:44,239
always tried to look for ways i could

03:16:42,960 --> 03:16:47,040
help

03:16:44,239 --> 03:16:47,600
i could help somebody else at the other

03:16:47,040 --> 03:16:49,680
end

03:16:47,600 --> 03:16:51,359
i always try to look for ways i could

03:16:49,680 --> 03:16:54,720
you know improve

03:16:51,359 --> 03:16:58,000
or promote people that were contributing

03:16:54,720 --> 03:17:01,760
so i really loved the community work and

03:16:58,000 --> 03:17:04,720
i would always be a community farm

03:17:01,760 --> 03:17:05,840
also i tried to create a niche for

03:17:04,720 --> 03:17:08,880
myself

03:17:05,840 --> 03:17:12,080
while contributing to open source

03:17:08,880 --> 03:17:15,359
so i i found out because of the

03:17:12,080 --> 03:17:18,560
difficulties i had contributing

03:17:15,359 --> 03:17:21,200
i started advocating for beginners

03:17:18,560 --> 03:17:22,479
because i found out that in most open

03:17:21,200 --> 03:17:25,680
source projects

03:17:22,479 --> 03:17:26,479
beginners are not well appreciated and

03:17:25,680 --> 03:17:29,600
that like

03:17:26,479 --> 03:17:33,279
i i saw that and i said okay what

03:17:29,600 --> 03:17:34,880
i'll try my best in whatever community i

03:17:33,279 --> 03:17:37,840
find myself in

03:17:34,880 --> 03:17:40,479
try to advocate for beginners try to

03:17:37,840 --> 03:17:43,520
tell them you can get into open source

03:17:40,479 --> 03:17:46,160
because most people think it's just code

03:17:43,520 --> 03:17:48,160
it's just about the software but so many

03:17:46,160 --> 03:17:51,279
people do not

03:17:48,160 --> 03:17:53,680
you can actually do other things

03:17:51,279 --> 03:17:55,680
you can engage in community you can

03:17:53,680 --> 03:17:58,720
engage in documentation

03:17:55,680 --> 03:18:03,200
i also try to do public speaking

03:17:58,720 --> 03:18:05,439
to to help others understand that yes

03:18:03,200 --> 03:18:07,040
you can contribute to open source

03:18:05,439 --> 03:18:10,239
without having to write

03:18:07,040 --> 03:18:10,720
code and also quality impact that he

03:18:10,239 --> 03:18:14,239
brought

03:18:10,720 --> 03:18:17,359
on the software so a bit about this i am

03:18:14,239 --> 03:18:20,399
part of the chaos um badging

03:18:17,359 --> 03:18:23,040
chaos badging project and you know

03:18:20,399 --> 03:18:23,760
we are trying what that badging project

03:18:23,040 --> 03:18:28,319
is about

03:18:23,760 --> 03:18:31,680
it's um giving diversity and inclusion

03:18:28,319 --> 03:18:35,120
and inclusive badges to conferences

03:18:31,680 --> 03:18:37,359
that observe this metrics so over time

03:18:35,120 --> 03:18:41,040
contributing to that project i

03:18:37,359 --> 03:18:43,840
was able to see how people would change

03:18:41,040 --> 03:18:44,720
their their their metrics to you know

03:18:43,840 --> 03:18:47,920
suit

03:18:44,720 --> 03:18:50,880
diverse diverse cultures right so

03:18:47,920 --> 03:18:52,080
there's a lot of quality impact i was

03:18:50,880 --> 03:18:54,479
able to make and i

03:18:52,080 --> 03:18:57,760
see them and that makes me love open

03:18:54,479 --> 03:18:57,760
source contributions

03:19:00,720 --> 03:19:04,479
yes there were rewards and con

03:19:03,080 --> 03:19:07,520
recognitions

03:19:04,479 --> 03:19:10,720
so we're contributing to open source

03:19:07,520 --> 03:19:13,920
right i've got a lot of

03:19:10,720 --> 03:19:16,640
a lot of recognitions both from

03:19:13,920 --> 03:19:17,120
persons and both from organizations

03:19:16,640 --> 03:19:19,680
right

03:19:17,120 --> 03:19:20,720
because these organizations i i have

03:19:19,680 --> 03:19:23,439
been part of

03:19:20,720 --> 03:19:25,920
were really helpful to my quotes there

03:19:23,439 --> 03:19:28,319
were rewards for me there were

03:19:25,920 --> 03:19:33,840
recognitions which i'll talk about in

03:19:28,319 --> 03:19:36,800
the next slide

03:19:33,840 --> 03:19:39,040
so one of the biggest rewards was

03:19:36,800 --> 03:19:42,160
becoming a github star

03:19:39,040 --> 03:19:45,359
so rewind back to when i said i am

03:19:42,160 --> 03:19:46,000
just i'm barely one year so june is

03:19:45,359 --> 03:19:48,319
going to make

03:19:46,000 --> 03:19:49,120
it one year of contributing to open

03:19:48,319 --> 03:19:52,880
source

03:19:49,120 --> 03:19:56,160
and for my contributions and the impact

03:19:52,880 --> 03:20:00,880
i have made the people i have inspired

03:19:56,160 --> 03:20:00,880
and have been able to educate i

03:20:01,840 --> 03:20:06,000
and it was so amazing because i was like

03:20:05,359 --> 03:20:09,120
the

03:20:06,000 --> 03:20:12,399
first um female um from

03:20:09,120 --> 03:20:15,920
from africa right i was in the midst of

03:20:12,399 --> 03:20:19,120
um in list of three amazing

03:20:15,920 --> 03:20:20,960
uh male uh milk guys so i

03:20:19,120 --> 03:20:22,160
they were people that you know i have

03:20:20,960 --> 03:20:24,960
always looked

03:20:22,160 --> 03:20:26,560
up looked up to and you know getting

03:20:24,960 --> 03:20:29,359
that recognition meant

03:20:26,560 --> 03:20:32,000
a whole lot to me and it's you know

03:20:29,359 --> 03:20:35,359
spoiled me to keep contributing and to

03:20:32,000 --> 03:20:39,040
keep inspiring and educating others

03:20:35,359 --> 03:20:40,640
and also recently i got some swags from

03:20:39,040 --> 03:20:43,840
google open source

03:20:40,640 --> 03:20:47,840
they recognized my contributions um

03:20:43,840 --> 03:20:50,319
with no um chaos and they sent me some

03:20:47,840 --> 03:20:53,840
swags which was pretty interesting

03:20:50,319 --> 03:20:56,160
because while i was unboxing those swags

03:20:53,840 --> 03:20:58,560
i unboxed it with my parents

03:20:56,160 --> 03:20:59,439
and they were so happy that you know i

03:20:58,560 --> 03:21:02,319
made

03:20:59,439 --> 03:21:02,800
in i have been inspiring i have been

03:21:02,319 --> 03:21:06,080
doing

03:21:02,800 --> 03:21:09,600
amazing things by myself

03:21:06,080 --> 03:21:12,720
right and also i got an award as a

03:21:09,600 --> 03:21:13,520
github star so when the award came it

03:21:12,720 --> 03:21:16,239
was so

03:21:13,520 --> 03:21:17,359
beautiful it's so beautiful rather and

03:21:16,239 --> 03:21:20,640
you know

03:21:17,359 --> 03:21:25,840
i it made me love more things about

03:21:20,640 --> 03:21:25,840
contributing to open source

03:21:28,560 --> 03:21:34,479
now how can you help how can you

03:21:31,760 --> 03:21:34,880
you know create a more inclusive space

03:21:34,479 --> 03:21:38,399
for

03:21:34,880 --> 03:21:41,520
non-code contributors how can you

03:21:38,399 --> 03:21:41,920
how can you encourage more beginners to

03:21:41,520 --> 03:21:45,439
get

03:21:41,920 --> 03:21:45,439
involved in open source

03:21:48,160 --> 03:21:52,080
recognize and appreciate non-code

03:21:50,880 --> 03:21:55,040
contributions

03:21:52,080 --> 03:21:55,520
in your project or your community so

03:21:55,040 --> 03:21:58,960
this

03:21:55,520 --> 03:22:01,279
is a call um a call to action for you

03:21:58,960 --> 03:22:02,880
listening for everybody listening to

03:22:05,680 --> 03:22:09,600
community

03:22:06,720 --> 03:22:11,279
in your project set channels and

03:22:09,600 --> 03:22:14,399
pipelines to encourage

03:22:11,279 --> 03:22:17,439
non-code contributions appreciate them

03:22:14,399 --> 03:22:18,560
and you know tell um try to encourage

03:22:17,439 --> 03:22:22,000
their work

03:22:18,560 --> 03:22:25,200
try to um put the spotlights on them

03:22:22,000 --> 03:22:27,640
open source is not just about code right

03:22:25,200 --> 03:22:28,960
try to show empathy in your

03:22:27,640 --> 03:22:31,439
communications

03:22:28,960 --> 03:22:32,479
in your engagement with non-code

03:22:31,439 --> 03:22:34,720
contributors

03:22:32,479 --> 03:22:36,319
even generally while you're

03:22:34,720 --> 03:22:39,520
communicating because

03:22:36,319 --> 03:22:41,680
you know it's it's a diverse team

03:22:39,520 --> 03:22:44,960
and you do not understand you might not

03:22:41,680 --> 03:22:47,520
know what the other person at the end of

03:22:44,960 --> 03:22:48,239
the at the other end is feeling other

03:22:47,520 --> 03:22:50,960
moments

03:22:48,239 --> 03:22:52,560
so please try to show empathy while

03:22:50,960 --> 03:22:55,600
you're communicating

03:22:52,560 --> 03:22:56,880
and also the most important thing i want

03:22:55,600 --> 03:22:59,920
you to take away

03:22:56,880 --> 03:23:03,279
from this session is recognize and

03:22:59,920 --> 03:23:06,080
appreciate non-code contributions

03:23:03,279 --> 03:23:08,160
set channels and pipelines to encourage

03:23:06,080 --> 03:23:12,080
those non-code contributions

03:23:08,160 --> 03:23:13,760
and also to look at beginners coming

03:23:12,080 --> 03:23:14,640
into your project because they are

03:23:13,760 --> 03:23:17,279
helpful

03:23:14,640 --> 03:23:17,840
beginners see things from a different

03:23:17,279 --> 03:23:21,359
end

03:23:17,840 --> 03:23:23,680
right so try to encourage beginners

03:23:21,359 --> 03:23:25,359
that come into your project try to make

03:23:23,680 --> 03:23:27,680
things easier for them

03:23:25,359 --> 03:23:28,800
try to tell them okay if this is not

03:23:27,680 --> 03:23:30,720
your spark

03:23:28,800 --> 03:23:33,120
if you can't try python you could

03:23:30,720 --> 03:23:36,080
contribute to documentation

03:23:33,120 --> 03:23:36,560
you could help with community engagement

03:23:36,080 --> 03:23:39,040
so

03:23:36,560 --> 03:23:40,000
try this is a call out action to

03:23:39,040 --> 03:23:42,640
everybody

03:23:40,000 --> 03:23:43,040
that is listening presently to this talk

03:23:42,640 --> 03:23:45,600
and

03:23:43,040 --> 03:23:48,319
persons are going to listen to this so

03:23:45,600 --> 03:23:48,319
in future

03:23:50,239 --> 03:23:54,640
so uh i'll take questions if there are

03:23:53,680 --> 03:23:59,840
any questions

03:23:54,640 --> 03:23:59,840
at this point

03:24:10,840 --> 03:24:14,960
so

03:24:12,319 --> 03:24:15,359
thank you very much for your talk very

03:24:14,960 --> 03:24:18,880
very

03:24:15,359 --> 03:24:22,479
interesting um there's actually only

03:24:18,880 --> 03:24:24,239
um one question in the short note

03:24:22,479 --> 03:24:26,800
i'm not sure if someone else is writing

03:24:24,239 --> 03:24:28,800
right now i know there is someone

03:24:26,800 --> 03:24:30,319
texting in the chat so initially if you

03:24:28,800 --> 03:24:31,680
can access the

03:24:30,319 --> 03:24:33,120
shared note if you want me to read the

03:24:31,680 --> 03:24:34,720
question for you if you prefer to read

03:24:33,120 --> 03:24:36,640
it yourself

03:24:34,720 --> 03:24:39,040
i'm trying to access it it's still

03:24:36,640 --> 03:24:41,439
loading on my end so you can try to read

03:24:39,040 --> 03:24:41,439
it through

03:24:52,080 --> 03:24:56,319
so the first question is whether you

03:24:54,640 --> 03:24:57,680
have considered using a graphical

03:24:56,319 --> 03:25:00,960
interface to access

03:24:57,680 --> 03:25:04,479
git okay um

03:25:00,960 --> 03:25:07,439
so yes i actually tried using the

03:25:04,479 --> 03:25:07,439
github um

03:25:07,760 --> 03:25:11,520
um but there are some limitations to

03:25:10,640 --> 03:25:13,760
using

03:25:11,520 --> 03:25:15,600
on one of the projects i still

03:25:13,760 --> 03:25:18,239
contributing with

03:25:15,600 --> 03:25:19,680
so i you would always need to sign off

03:25:18,239 --> 03:25:22,080
your commits

03:25:19,680 --> 03:25:24,640
when you create a commit and that was

03:25:22,080 --> 03:25:27,040
not available with github desktop

03:25:24,640 --> 03:25:29,520
so on that particular project there was

03:25:27,040 --> 03:25:30,640
no way i could use github desktop so i

03:25:29,520 --> 03:25:37,840
had to stick

03:25:30,640 --> 03:25:37,840
with using gits

03:25:43,760 --> 03:25:48,160
definitely i still encourage um

03:25:46,160 --> 03:25:51,920
beginners to also try out

03:25:48,160 --> 03:25:54,880
using our the github desktop too so

03:25:51,920 --> 03:25:54,880
yeah it works

03:25:57,359 --> 03:26:00,880
is there any other question

03:26:02,319 --> 03:26:07,200
second question which is what are good

03:26:04,800 --> 03:26:09,680
channels to reach non-tech people

03:26:07,200 --> 03:26:11,760
i suppose things like erc and guitar are

03:26:09,680 --> 03:26:15,920
still very tech focused

03:26:11,760 --> 03:26:15,920
and so are issue lists on github

03:26:16,319 --> 03:26:22,080
okay so channels to reach non-tech

03:26:19,439 --> 03:26:22,880
so you know twitter the tech community

03:26:22,080 --> 03:26:26,319
first of

03:26:22,880 --> 03:26:29,359
all the tech community on twitter is

03:26:26,319 --> 03:26:31,840
one very active one so you know

03:26:29,359 --> 03:26:33,760
you could reach you could reach out um

03:26:31,840 --> 03:26:34,880
non-tech people from you know making

03:26:33,760 --> 03:26:38,160
call outs if your

03:26:34,880 --> 03:26:39,279
if your product has a has a twitter

03:26:38,160 --> 03:26:41,920
channel

03:26:39,279 --> 03:26:43,279
you can do a call out um and

03:26:41,920 --> 03:26:45,840
specifically

03:26:43,279 --> 03:26:47,279
states that you encourage non-code

03:26:45,840 --> 03:26:49,920
contributions

03:26:47,279 --> 03:26:51,200
and you know encourage them to either

03:26:49,920 --> 03:26:53,120
send a dm

03:26:51,200 --> 03:26:54,640
or make it in the comments and

03:26:53,120 --> 03:26:57,840
definitely you would get

03:26:54,640 --> 03:26:58,160
responses and also maybe when whenever

03:26:57,840 --> 03:27:01,520
you

03:26:58,160 --> 03:27:04,800
introduce your projects in conferences

03:27:01,520 --> 03:27:08,319
or wherever you talk about your project

03:27:04,800 --> 03:27:10,399
also put it there that you um there are

03:27:08,319 --> 03:27:13,040
different ways to contribute

03:27:10,399 --> 03:27:14,560
to your project non-code contributions

03:27:13,040 --> 03:27:17,439
are always welcome

03:27:14,560 --> 03:27:17,760
so i trust that putting it out there you

03:27:17,439 --> 03:27:21,120
know

03:27:17,760 --> 03:27:24,399
attracts whosoever wants to contribute

03:27:21,120 --> 03:27:29,840
um without code

03:27:24,399 --> 03:27:29,840
to contribute to the project

03:27:37,279 --> 03:27:42,160
there is also a third question which is

03:27:40,800 --> 03:27:44,239
if you have a blog

03:27:42,160 --> 03:27:47,040
where people can read about your open

03:27:44,239 --> 03:27:47,040
source journey

03:27:48,239 --> 03:27:52,800
