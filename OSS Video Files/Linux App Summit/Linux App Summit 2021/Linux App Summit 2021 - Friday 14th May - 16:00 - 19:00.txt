i think so

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,720
hello again we are going to

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,479
talking about

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:42,080
uh embedded systems and let's hear

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:45,840
kathy please start your presentation

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,840
and have a good time

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,720
hello everyone hello welcome

please do okay hello everyone

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:14,240
from uh probably the other side of the

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,560
world for most of you i'm in california

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,680
and uh i come to you giving you a short

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,919
presentation

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,000
of some great open source projects

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,400
including uh web things where i may

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,160
give you a tour of my home how i can

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,440
maintain a smart home that's all private

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,720
to me

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,839
or as much as possible private to me so

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,880
uh let's see how do i advance

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,880
my slides

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,159
um

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,159
sorry didn't do the

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,120
presentation oh there we go right there

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,200
the right arrow

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,240
okay so just a little bit about me so

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,080
i've been in the

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,399
technology industry for a really long

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,480
time i came out here

00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,680
to go to grad school and ended up my

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,720
first job was like

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:06,080
for tran data analysis of electric field

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,320
mills doing all sorts of cool stuff

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,160
i've just been involved in doing things

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,839
with you know linux and

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,920
tools and open source for a very long

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,040
time and more recently

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,279
i'm trying to spend a lot of my

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,000
volunteer time applying open source

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,839
technology

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,240
into the education space so i'm going to

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,519
be showing you a little bit about a

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,720
great project we call

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,360
microblocks which was developed by the

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,920
founders

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,240
one of the founders of scratch and it's

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,720
how you can do physical computing

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,000
with a blocks based language and it

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,600
actually applies really well

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,519
to the internet of things because

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,519
anything with connectivity

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,040
can be turned into what we call a web

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,560
thing now

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,839
um i'm gonna skip the

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,279
boring introduction about myself uh

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,959
the first thing i want to do is take you

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,200
through some of the parameters

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,800
of why privacy and security are

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,600
important i'm sure you all understand

00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,519
that but

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,760
basically i wrote down on this slide the

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,160
concerns i have for my own home

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,000
which is you know security i don't want

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,720
hackers being able to attack me like

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,360
they did the

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,880
colonial pipeline recently you know you

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,240
don't want cyber attacks

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,480
um privacy that's like

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,240
super important to me not as important

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,959
to everyone but for me

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,399
just when a door opens and closes when

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,000
there's motion in the home

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,760
when there's network presence of the

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,160
devices in the home

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,760
uh when lights are switched on and off

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,320
all of that type of information

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,880
is really a blueprint for when people

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,839
are home

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,320
when a home is occupied or not and if

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,480
that

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,160
information were stored in the cloud and

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,480
somehow hacked

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,320
and millions of homes you know tens of

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,600
millions of homes had occupancy data

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,240
that would be a great

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,600
you know dark web data set for someone

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,360
to know

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,880
you know what if you come and go for

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,880
work and when to break into your home or

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,440
not i mean that to me that's

00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,079
just just the tip of the iceberg there's

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,760
all sorts of privacy concerns i have but

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,079
you know mainly it's just like you don't

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,839
want to live in a glass house right

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,519
and by exposing all your data that's

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,560
what you're doing

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,200
the um the other third

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,240
main problem of smart home is

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,480
interoperability

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,399
like you can buy into one system and use

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,839
that system for everything you do

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,600
but you're kind of stuck on what that

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,279
vendor offers you

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,120
and it's really hard to do your own

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,240
thing or mix and match or grow it over

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,519
time

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,160
so what i'm going to be demonstrating

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,839
today really is a growth of something

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,079
over time i didn't like put it all

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,839
together in one fell swoop

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,680
and and lastly um at least for me if i

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,160
hadn't worked at mozilla

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,880
on the web things project and gotten my

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,560
hands on

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,959
a lot of different smart home devices

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,560
and really got intimate about how they

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,880
worked and which ones

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,760
you know connect over a radio that's

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,480
non-iip

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,240
protocol like zigbee or z-wave connect

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,320
only to my device

00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,839
if i wasn't like doing that full-time as

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,639
a job when would i

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,079
ever have had the time to research all

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,240
the different devices out there

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,839
all the different systems and tools so

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,440
in addition to having some

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,279
you know interoperability and ease of

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,279
use i think the overall value

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:18,079
is to consumers to help them understand

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,519
what devices are easy to use and why

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,839
what ones protect your

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,959
privacy or not you know those kinds of

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,720
things is

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,279
something we need to wrap into the whole

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,040
system so what i'm showing you today is

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,399
definitely a you know a developer

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,959
centric

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,720
uh view i think but it has commercial

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,360
implications

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,560
one of the main differences in the

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,160
approach we took

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,320
with the web things project at mozilla

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,079
which is by right now by the way a

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,440
community project so if you want to get

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,880
ahead of myself

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,800
uh web things dot io um in one of the

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,000
tabs and you can look up the project

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:57,120
basically my home runs on a rapid high

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,560
in this case the data center is the

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,440
raspberry pi

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,480
in my house and so your home is your

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,800
data center

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,600
and you only use the cloud for example

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,040
to

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,760
access from your smart home um

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,519
you know the web interface oops so that

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,079
when you're away from home you can still

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,720
monitor

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,880
and and that tunnels through the the

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,920
internet over https

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,440
so it's https access only instead a

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,399
typical vendor and this is just a web

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,720
page

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,760
a progressive web app that i have you

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,320
know as a

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,360
as an icon on my desktop so i just click

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,000
the icon

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,600
and i'm right in the app otherwise i

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,320
have loads of apps that i've had to

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,399
download

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,320
just for the initial installation of for

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,399
example wi-fi devices

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,160
and if you have this system of all these

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,440
different vendors you end up with

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,199
hundreds of like different apps and

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,000
interoperability between them becomes

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,399
very cumbersome

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,160
all right so those are some of the

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,440
problems looking at interoperability

00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,519
itself

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,160
what the web of things does is there's a

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,600
standards body group called in the w3c

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,920
called the web of things which this

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,120
project is based on and it just says all

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,399
we're going to do is we're going to tie

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,240
all these different protocols

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,600
all these different messaging methods

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,240
we're going to put them all together

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,920
at the web layer so that web services

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,000
json definitions except

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,959
essentially describe these different

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
things and they have

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:24,000
actions events and properties properties

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,120
being the main thing

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,800
and so new technology coming along the

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,760
one that was called connected home over

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,959
ip is now

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,600
renamed to matter and i think zb

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,880
b was renamed to something else recently

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,399
but it doesn't really matter you can

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,279
bring them all together

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,519
and so your own private home consists of

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,519
sort of this web things gateway

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,839
things that you buy you can also build

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:51,680
things and then you just manage it all

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:53,360
under one one roof essentially

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,040
and i wrote a tutorial that really needs

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,040
to be updated because it's still got

00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,000
mozilla branding all over it but

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,639
there is information on the wiki uh the

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,639
web things

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,160
framework there's all sorts of libraries

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,639
that take

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,839
um that give you in different languages

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,240
ways to create web

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,839
things out of data you know everything

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,040
from arduino and

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:19,360
micro blocks to uh you know python and

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,920
javascript and rust even

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,760
and then microblocks like i said is what

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,800
i use to program

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,639
microcontrollers typically and i can

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,480
turn these things into web things with

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,240
just the addition of a library and a few

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,639
additional blocks that say

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,480
you know i have a temperature property

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,600
and uh and it shows me the degrees

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,720
celsius or

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,079
fahrenheit or whatever i want

00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:45,040
microblocks.fun is another tab to open

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,040
up on your browser

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,959
and just to show you a little bit behind

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,959
the scenes when i

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:54,800
open the microblocks ide

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,199
i get a library list and i have the

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,560
capabilities the properties actions

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,800
and events actually it only does

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,320
properties and events in this library

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:07,199
and then i can create smart lights smart

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,000
motion sensors door sensors temperature

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,279
sensors

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,920
and all you have to do is pull the

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,959
blocks together and behind those blocks

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,360
so all i have to do is

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:18,240
behind the blocks is the actual holes on

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,399
and so i can turn one of these uh

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,680
micro bit boards really easily into a

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,079
smart light

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,399
into you know it has an onboard motion

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,639
sensor could be a smart motion sensor

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,160
and these extra blocks in red are the

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,079
web things blocks

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,000
and all it's doing in this case is i

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,279
could use a button to toggle the light

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,320
on and off

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,440
with the actual device or with my web

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,680
browser

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,040
i just toggle the icon on and off and i

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,959
didn't have to build the web page

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,639
because the raspberry pi does that

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:53,600
and the blocks on web things do the rest

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:55,839
so iot for education becomes really easy

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,440
now extending an alternative to the web

00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,199
things get would be to use something

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,000
like snap where you can just build

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,720
your user interface and and snap is

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,720
another

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,039
blocks based language that runs on your

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,919
laptop through browser and it's

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,199
just awesome and amazing

00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:13,520
snap.berkeley.edu

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,280
and just a little hint about how

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,400
microblocks actually works is these

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,240
blocks

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,000
are actually the programs that are

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,480
running behind them there's these op

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,400
codes that turn into machine code that

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,919
actually runs on the bare metal of the

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,360
microcontroller so there's actually a

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,120
virtual machine

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,760
that is running the blocks and then when

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,440
you just can disconnect the

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,640
microcontroller from your laptop the

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,640
blocks are still running in the

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,600
microcontroller so it does run and

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,720
fully uh autonomously in an untethered

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,400
situation so

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,640
it really is a fantastic language

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,720
compared to something like

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,039
arduino which i've worked for and used

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,039
in the past this is so much better

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,559
and there's a virtual machine to build

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,840
for all these different microcontrollers

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,160
we use platform io

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,919
as the tool for that because it's just

00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,520
phenomenal for any

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,000
text-based framework that you want to

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,039
build for microcontrollers so

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,679
if you uh clone the git repository you

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,840
can build

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,600
microblocks for whatever boards are

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,679
supported which is in the platform io

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,440
any file

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,679
just picture you'll see we have some

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,400
online demos on

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,400
um my youtube account something about

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,440
iot and privacy

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,480
uh there's a raspberry pi and a speaker

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,160
and um speaker microphone i'm going to

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,160
demonstrate that live so i'm not going

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,400
to show this video

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,760
that's sitting over in the other room

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,760
and then the web things

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,600
links just going to show you a few links

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,840
here web things dot io

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:44,559
is sort of the starting point for that

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,760
um i have some youtube playlists for

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,960
both microblocks

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,240
and iot and i can share this entire

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,400
presentation

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,760
there's if you have if you subscribe to

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,320
make magazine

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,720
or you can just go to the online version

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,400
of make magazine and get it for free

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:05,280
um issues 72 and 74

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,880
if i'm if i remember correctly one has a

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,120
web things

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,000
article i wrote and one has the micro

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,600
blocks article

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,840
and all the different microcontrollers

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,760
you can use

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,360
and if you want to get involved this

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,640
just has a bunch of information

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,799
about how to contact me my twitter and

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,640
linkedin handles

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,559
and then just to note that the other

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,679
thing i love about open source and

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,559
community different pro

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,840
driven projects is that early on i

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,280
pushed hard to get web things

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,480
translation

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:39,600
uh into the project the same tools um

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,720
pontoon and fluent

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,559
for uh translating firefox of the same

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,200
tools used to translate web things so

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,600
you can

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,200
you can convert web things from just

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,280
picking your language

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,799
and the translators wanted for all these

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,559
different languages

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,280
for microblocks the translation is a

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,280
little different there's

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,840
the one language like english translate

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,919
to another language and then

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,600
once that's available you can also

00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,080
change the ide to many different

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,480
languages

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,039
so this is a summary of like microblocks

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,440
web things platform io snap

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,039
four great awesome open source projects

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,159
with with really excellent

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:25,200
educational potential i feel and there's

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:28,000
one more that i wanted to introduce

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,880
for two reasons one is that i started

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,240
working for

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,000
a commercial company that takes

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,120
advantage of this linux foundation open

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,280
source project

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,200
and the second thing like there's a big

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,159
example of it lately the canon

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,000
colonial pipeline in the east coast of

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,000
states they're having all sorts of gas

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,880
shortage issues with people

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,840
hoarding gas because there was a cyber

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,400
attack on a on this colonial pipeline

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,400
and so the next project what it what it

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,799
aims to do is to take

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,880
embedded linux products that are

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:02,080
deployed at the edge

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:06,080
and make a secure conduit to the cloud

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,360
for them and rather than sort of

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,960
you know worrying about lots of

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,520
different linux distros and lots of

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,919
different

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,600
applications running at the edge there's

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,039
a linux foundation project

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:20,159
called e for um

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:22,240
uh sort of for a virtualization or

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,960
containerized approach to the edge where

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,840
you have the

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,799
thinnest shim of a linux kernel running

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,240
on hardware

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,559
and it basically does all the

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,960
virtualization it's it's

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,320
it utilizes alpine which is really

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,000
supposed to be a

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,640
thin shim and then you deploy

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,640
applications through the secure conduit

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,320
and only the controller conduit can run

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,080
them so i really do

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,240
have you know pretty good faith that

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,080
we'll be able to stop some of these

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,520
cyber attacks that are occurring because

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,720
of all of these exposed

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,600
edge iot devices and this project you

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,840
can find

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,080
um on linux foundation and then on

00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,440
github

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,200
and there's an open source

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,360
implementation where

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,120
eve has an os version that runs on the

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,080
edge and then you can use a command line

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,799
controller

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,799
or there's a commercial um instance at

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,559
the company i'm currently contacted for

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,480
called zida

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,919
and so you find that as a linux

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,480
foundation so that's another great

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,880
project

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,200
for sort of the security and privacy

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,520
around iot

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,280
now on the demo side i'm going to focus

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,480
on two things first

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:31,679
smart where i keep and

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,159
secondly i'm going to spend a little

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,240
time

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,280
on the micro block side so you can see

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,840
how how cool it is to be able to

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,360
program you know microcontrollers and

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,679
turn them into

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,200
physical computing devices and if they

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:49,520
have connectivity iot

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:54,799
devices so without further ado

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:58,559
i'm going to share my screen

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,559
and i don't know if um

00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:05,200
[Music]

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,120
i don't know if it's going to be

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:12,880
possible to

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,880
minimize the slides then

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:25,760
so i want to close this there we go

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:28,799
look at that now you're seeing my

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,840
my web browser okay so

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:35,440
the first thing i want to do here

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,000
is i need to open this window so you can

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,159
actually see

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,159
it

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,200
okay so this is what i'm sharing what i

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,000
want to show you

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,360
is this is just an interface of either

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,360
virtual objects or

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:53,440
real objects in the case of an ip camera

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,360
i have one that points outside the front

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,760
door of my home and it looks you know

00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,480
out of the front sidewalk you can see

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:03,360
cars in the driveway or on the street

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:06,000
helps you see that and that's just again

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,799
snapshotted through the browser

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,080
these are sensors that are air quality

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,320
sensors that come through an

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,760
add-on so the whole framework of this

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,600
web of things is that

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,760
there's a core you know javascript

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,000
object notation for defining all these

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,039
things

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,919
in a standard way but then once they are

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:26,480
represented

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:28,640
then any object you can open up its uh

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,720
splat icon and see the details and you

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:36,240
can see various information about it

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,600
and so this you know air quality sensor

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,600
is actually within a

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,679
kilometer of my house but it's not my

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,600
air quality sensor it's something i've

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,159
pulled in the data from the internet and

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,840
so i can use it to determine when to

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,919
close my windows and doors

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,159
in the summer when there's wildfires in

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,880
the area which has been a problem lately

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,120
and this this exact um add-on the air

00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,000
quality purple

00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:02,080
purpleair.com add-on was a request by me

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,039
and a developer in germany actually put

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,159
it together

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,679
in a day to help me know when to close

00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,400
my windows indoors

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,440
and so i have a rule of an upstairs

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,960
screen door

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,960
that if it's open in the middle of the

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,880
night and the air quality like the wind

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,600
shifts directions the air quality goes

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,000
into the bad

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,960
unhealthy range then i have the little

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,600
speaker

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,960
um alert me and wake me up in the middle

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,039
of the night even three am

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,080
and i close the door and all i have to

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,120
do is close the door

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,200
and the rule will change to um

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,039
stop saying that so if i actually go

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,120
into the rules here

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,400
the beauty of it again of being all in

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,799
one place

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,320
is that then i have rules to tell me

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,480
okay so bad air

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,159
if door open so if i look at that rule

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,559
what i was just describing when the air

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:51,840
quality goes above a certain amount

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:53,039
and the upper deck door is open and it's

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,520
an even minute

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,279
it's going to alert me with bad air

00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,880
until i

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,799
reset you know until the air quality

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,880
goes lower or i close basically all i

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:06,320
have to do is close the door

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,799
so that's really cool and then

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,240
um what i said you know about the beauty

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,159
of the add-ons

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,080
before i take you around on tour i just

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,919
wanted to show you how that works so

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,559
there's rules

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,000
um for all of this tying things together

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,440
there's logging

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,520
so i just want to quickly show you what

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,240
that means so you know when the entry

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,400
door was

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,000
you know open and closed some motion in

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,679
the tv area

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,679
which is near the kitchen area when the

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,200
front door was open things like that so

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,600
then there's all sorts of

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,520
temperatures and earthquakes and motions

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,080
and tides and air quality

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,600
and so all of this stuff is logged for

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,080
seven days

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,000
um over a period of time and then i also

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,760
have it laid out over a floor plan

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,360
if i want to do floor plan view but i

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,120
have so many things now that i

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:55,440
i tend to use the other view and then

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,360
just so you know this is a raspberry pi

00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,559
connected on the wi-fi network you could

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,960
also plug it in over

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,720
ethernet the domain is something you set

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,600
on your own so you have your own private

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,440
domain

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,360
i'm actually connected locally not

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,919
through the internet right now

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,080
the whole system actually works without

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,159
internet access it all runs locally if

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,320
my internet broadband is down

00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:19,039
my local network will still continue to

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,799
function my users as many as i want for

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,120
logging in

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,880
the localization as i mentioned before

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,600
is just going to be

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,679
for date time rules and parameters and

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,159
then the languages

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,679
pick your language there and then also

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,559
pick your units of

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,399
whether you want imperial or celsius

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:41,840
units i always use

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:43,760
metric so going back

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,320
experiments there's developer things i

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,080
can go into the detailed logs

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,720
create authorizations and whether you

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,159
want to enable ssh into your pi

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,640
and then the updates at least for the

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:57,760
raspberry pi version are automatic

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,399
so it keeps me up to date and then i'll

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,360
go into

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,880
add-ons is really the name of the game

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,640
and if you want to see add-ons even

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,159
without having this installed

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:12,720
while i go along you can do

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:15,520
um web things api dot web things dot io

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,000
port eight four four three slash add-on

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,840
slash

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
info and it shows you um

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,000
all of these add-ons and what these

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,360
add-ons do is it takes

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,559
commercial data or internet

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:33,360
services data takes data from

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,520
anywhere on the internet or any device

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,200
and converts it into this standardized

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,200
w3c web of things

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,520
thing descriptions and then

00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:46,320
interoperability

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,960
of rules and so forth is based on having

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:52,559
all the data sense in this common

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,080
framework so those are add-ons so if i

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,279
go and look at the add-ons i have

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,279
installed

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,520
you can see how i configure them so the

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,880
date and time depends on my latitude and

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,000
longitude

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,080
and i can offset some sunrise sunrise so

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,440
i have actually outdoor led lighting in

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,840
my front porch

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,760
that depends on rules of when is sunset

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,399
so rather than keep changing the time

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,399
for the time

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,320
you know for as the years change and it

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,480
gets darker or lighter

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,559
i just have the lights go on at sunset

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,880
and go off at 10 pm

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,399
i never have to change the rule and then

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,520
i monitor earthquakes

00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:29,760
from the usgs online data set

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,880
and i can say how far away i want them

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,159
to

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,320
to look from my house and the magnitude

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,279
and so we might get some browser alerts

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,200
that tell

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,720
you know when when there's a earthquake

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,240
there was one right before i started

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,679
this talk but

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,080
even 1.0 earthquakes occur like all day

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,360
long

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,840
so we tend to get some and then

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,520
the google homes i have a couple of them

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,720
in my house they're set on mute so i

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,080
don't actually use them for

00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,640
smart assistance at all or rarely i

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,399
might unmute them to do something but um

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,919
i use them to talk to me

00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,520
you know that i find that they're just

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:09,279
excellent um

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,000
text to speech um things so i have these

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,640
all these

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
preset hand things that i have assigned

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,440
to rules so if there's an earthquake

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,200
over 5.0

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,000
i want to see where it was and how big

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,039
it was and maybe go into the usgs data

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,520
site

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,600
when we're out of the home i said a rule

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,039
that there's an intruder alert and any

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,679
door that gets opened

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,960
you know the multiple door sensors will

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,960
present this you know

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,480
loud announcements you can also set the

00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,760
volume on these announcements of

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,120
unauthorized persons

00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,240
you know must you know authority being

00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,480
contacted which is

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,320
authority being me um because i get

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,600
slack messages through a notification

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,600
add-on

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,440
and then i have a water sensor under my

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,760
sink so if there's a leak under there it

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,360
will

00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,000
notify me um porch motion i usually use

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,919
that rule

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,919
off but sometimes if i'm expecting a

00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,760
package delivery or something i'll turn

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,240
that notification on and then

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,640
if i'm somewhere i i'm notified that

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,039
someone came out to the porch

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,960
uh the bad air quality you know that's

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,320
another you know wildfire problem we

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,799
have in california

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,880
i have my rule set up for 2022. happy

00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,480
new year but you can have happy birthday

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,240
you know when somebody walks in the door

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,919
and the door opens you can wish them a

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,919
happy birthday i've done that before for

00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,679
my husband it's kind of fun

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:26,480
um and then i have a couple things of

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,000
just be aware like the leak detection or

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,080
the garage door left open i have a

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,279
little timer set for five minutes and if

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,279
the garage isn't set

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,840
isn't closed after five minutes then it

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:39,760
you know just says check the garage door

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:43,120
um you know for might have left it open

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,320
accidentally the pulse adapter is really

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,640
cool you can just create

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,679
toggles and buttons and things and time

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,080
out things for

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,240
whatever you want i have this everything

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,279
pulse which is always on and when i turn

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,519
it off

00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,799
it turns off all my powered devices like

00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,399
lights in the home

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:02,640
very convenient here's that purple air

00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:04,799
adapter again it's just just saying

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,120
how how many sensors within a kilometer

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:10,240
of my home do i want to monitor

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:13,519
and then i can add them to my gateway

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,799
scene control is like red alert lighting

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,519
again when the

00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:19,600
intrusion detection triggers it turns

00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,919
all of my lights on that are

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,960
that are smart lights and it turns all

00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,440
the colored lights

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,000
into red so the whole house lights up

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,640
and everything that can be red is red

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,679
so that's kind of a fun scene control

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,399
thing

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,360
scheduler i used a lot for the holidays

00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,120
you know i have my

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,120
christmas lights and stuff downstairs

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,960
turn on even before i

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,720
got out of bed and came downstairs and

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,559
you have the whole house is dark and

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,720
then you have the shimmering little

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,320
lights and it was really pretty and i

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,760
could set the schedule for different

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,960
days of the week when i get up at

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,840
different times

00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,600
to make sure they always came on slack

00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:58,159
is just a notification

00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,519
again for getting messages directly to

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,000
my phone

00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,000
sonos is the way i play internet

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,320
streamed music

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,320
and the tide in redwood city where i go

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,080
rowing there's they're all

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,399
you know like i say most of these things

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:15,360
are either a station where you're

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,080
fetching this data or some sort of um

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,080
means for

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,600
getting these internet services data

00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,279
it's really cool to bring all of this

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,799
data into you

00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,960
and then another one of my favorite

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:28,000
adapters voco is

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,519
uses the now acquired by sono snips

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,880
libraries but they were open source

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,760
libraries and one of the mozilla

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,840
developers

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,840
initially did a demonstration of it and

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,519
another guy in the netherlands

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,360
picked it up and made it even a lot

00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,760
better

00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,919
uh and you basically have a speaker

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,799
microphone and you speak to it locally

00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,720
and it implements these um you know

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,720
commands the same commands as i can do

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,279
through my web interface i can now do

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,360
through my voice and it has some extra

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,559
things like setting timers and

00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,720
setting something on or off for a

00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:01,120
certain amount of time so it's

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,240
uh that is just like one of my favorite

00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,080
add-ons

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,640
there's another one called voice control

00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,960
but it uses the

00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,639
mozilla deep speech library it doesn't

00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,079
actually work as well so i recommend

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,119
voco

00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:18,560
and then the weather again is just a

00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:21,839
latitude of longitude of where i am

00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:24,079
and the web thing is the is actually the

00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:26,720
sort of the standard and so when i build

00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,639
things with micro blocks i use the

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,399
the wi-fi things show up as just

00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,000
standard web things

00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,919
and then i have a couple other devices

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,119
and i use a lot of the battery operated

00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:36,960
things i use

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,320
almost all of the probably all of the

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,320
battery operated things i use

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,520
are zigbee because it's a very good low

00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,119
power

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:48,000
um good low power

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,359
protocol in fact i have you know right

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,399
here is a

00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:55,359
backroom motion sensor and so

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:56,720
that's that's works really well on

00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,040
battery

00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:01,200
so i just mentioned the voice so before

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,040
we do anything i just want to say that i

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,040
can

00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,320
test like if if you're worried about

00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,560
your voice commands is it

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,640
is it detecting your voice commands

00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,160
correctly or is it just that the system

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,839
isn't set up to understand what you're

00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,599
trying to say so you do need to know the

00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,040
name of the things

00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,200
and if you know the name of the things

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,640
and you can say select turn

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:26,400
on tv bulb

00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:29,440
for one minute and i can

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:32,240
send that and that turns into a

00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,440
timed event and so it says you know it's

00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,119
and she's gonna

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,520
little speaker will announce when it

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,480
goes off so now we can go over to that

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,800
area

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,720
and at some point this tv bulb is gonna

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,520
go off so let's go over here

00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,839
and see this is the tv bulb that that

00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,200
went

00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:50,960
on i could you know use my

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,040
maybe we'll go over there and we'll

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:56,000
change the color of the bulb

00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,599
as the first thing we'll do using my

00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,200
voice

00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:05,680
so now let me just check

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,680
and you'll see um

00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:10,000
okay so you see the screen and then you

00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,320
see you'll be able to i'm going to show

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,760
you

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,440
sensors like right up there so

00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,040
hopefully i'll do my best there's an

00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,440
actual door sensor up there

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,200
for the backside door but now i'm going

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,720
to walk you over to

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,720
the main hub of things

00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,400
which is the raspberry pi

00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,040
so she just announced that she was

00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,400
setting the timer

00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:42,320
uh back to off so now we would have to

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:46,160
actually go in there um

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,520
i'm going to just going to turn it back

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,560
on again

00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,560
and then i can say

00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,800
hey snips turn the tv bulb to orange

00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,800
okay so now the tv bulb is orange you

00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,680
can see that this is the

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,520
tv area motion sensor so the motion

00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:12,000
sensor is triggered

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:15,040
and then this is the uh

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,720
the google home that we can

00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,480
we can pretend that something has

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,960
happened like if the garage door was

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,280
left open

00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,960
check the garage door since it seems to

00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,880
have been left open

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,920
and so that's the type of alert i would

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:34,839
get when something like that happens

00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:36,160
um i could also if the bad air quality

00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:38,720
happens

00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,520
check air quality it's moving from

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:44,720
moderate to unhealthy

00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:47,440
and so it just alerts me in significant

00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,280
earthquakes and things like that so now

00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,400
we have this

00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:56,320
tv bulb on i also have a sonos

00:37:52,400 --> 00:38:04,079
connected and i can say

00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:07,200
hey snips turn on the sonos

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:12,960
okay and so what happens is now this is

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,960
turned on and if i walk over here

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,000
it's finishing up a commercial and then

00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,160
you can see

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,400
hopefully the orange of the light

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,880
and i also have a physical button this

00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,160
is an ikea zigbee button so i can turn

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,119
things on and off

00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,960
the music on and off with this i could

00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,240
turn it on and off with the playing

00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,839
button

00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,240
and right now it's basically just

00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:40,560
playing radio swiss jazz

00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,800
and so i can just also turn it on and

00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:46,079
off just like that

00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,320
okay so that's pretty cool this uh

00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,720
you know the color of this can be all

00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:55,680
sorts of different colors so

00:38:50,720 --> 00:39:00,800
if i turn it to let's say magenta

00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:02,720
then you should see a change right there

00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,400
and then i just want to show you you

00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,480
know it's all the simple things that are

00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,480
actually really useful like the

00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,079
entry door to the house is through this

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,400
garage door and it's right here at

00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:15,119
samsung smartthings sensor

00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,440
that should be this door right here and

00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:21,040
so when i open the door

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,040
you see that it shows that it's open

00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:26,960
and closed and i can trigger various

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:30,160
things based on those actions

00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:35,040
and um then

00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:36,720
over here i have some outdoor

00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,200
um i don't know if you can see but

00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,440
outdoor cafe lighting out there

00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,720
and i have this button i could use to

00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,320
turn it on

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,000
i don't know if you can see those lights

00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,079
turn on out there

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,079
but i can also use my voice even from

00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:57,119
across the room i can say

00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:59,200
hey snips turn off the string

00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,720
and she says setting power string to off

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,320
and it turns off

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,079
and then i have this virtual button

00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,280
that's everything that just says turn

00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,359
everything off

00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,720
i click it and all of my lights would go

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:11,359
off

00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,240
so again there's uh just going to take

00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,920
you on a

00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,160
quick another little tour of different

00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,400
devices near my video

00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:23,599
this is my front door so if this is open

00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:28,160
um i open the front door

00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:31,359
you'll see front door

00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,760
active and then out in the front

00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:35,599
actually this is like the picture of

00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,599
stuff the picture from the other thing

00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,240
that you saw and i have

00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,440
strip lighting right down here these are

00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,560
the leds

00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,160
right down in the rocks and the cool

00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,440
thing about those leds is because

00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,200
they're colored

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,680
i don't even have to set up lights for

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,599
different seasons and christmas time

00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,839
i have two strips one is red one is

00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,760
green and halloween they're orange and

00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,839
valentine's day they're pink and fourth

00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,040
of july they're red and blue

00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:07,760
and uh so that's the that's the

00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:10,480
garden lighting which is somewhere here

00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,240
down in here and then here's all my air

00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,400
quality sensors i have a whole bunch of

00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:17,760
them i have my slack alerts

00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:21,520
i have the tide in redmond city

00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,240
i have the earthquakes which right now

00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,880
there's nothing

00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:30,000
active within 100 500 kilometers

00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,680
um let's see i have like front hall

00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,400
motion sensors

00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,960
this is a little ikea one that's firing

00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,880
right now

00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,440
from that i have a desk lamp that goes

00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,880
on

00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,720
automatically at sunset i have

00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,880
you know buttons scattered throughout

00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,240
the house just for turning things on and

00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,480
off

00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,240
and i just want to show you a little ip

00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,319
camera now the ip camera i still don't

00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:57,280
point inside my house because it's wi-fi

00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,920
and it's connected to the internet as

00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,880
well

00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,480
it sits right here if you can see that

00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,359
but it sits in this front

00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,640
laundry room so and there's also a tiny

00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:10,720
little

00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,720
whoops i just dropped it

00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:19,680
sorry tiny little zigbee um

00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,960
this is a xiaomi device that does

00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,560
temperature and humidity

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:26,319
so the humidity was too much that might

00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:29,119
be a problem

00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:30,960
so and then upstairs there's door

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,000
centers there's

00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,240
uh if i show you there's a garage door

00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,400
sensor again i just use a normal door

00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,880
sensor for wanting the garages on and

00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:46,000
off this is the outdoor leds in the

00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:49,040
garden and uh various powered things

00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,079
the lamp has a timeout

00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,119
um other doors and that's you know

00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,000
that's

00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:58,960
there's the themes or the scenes that i

00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,079
can set to different things

00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,640
and and again

00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,400
the logging of all the data is really

00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,520
really useful

00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:12,079
so i'm going to wrap up with that home

00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,280
tour and make sure i leave some time for

00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,960
questions

00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:20,560
on that later but now

00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:24,079
i'm going to stop sharing that one

00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:25,839
and i'm instead and if there are some

00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,680
questions you can ask me interactively

00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:29,680
you're welcome to

00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,680
otherwise i'm going to show you how you

00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,319
can easily make your own smart home

00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,319
devices

00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,520
hope that was somewhat fun you can see

00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,440
i've built this home

00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,480
you know over a period of time it's not

00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:47,200
like i did it all at once

00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:49,200
okay so now i'm going to share another

00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,800
application and this is the microblocks

00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,880
ide

00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,400
and so what's going to happen is i have

00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,760
this little device i was playing with

00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,720
like more than a week ago

00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,400
it's a little servo servo that i can

00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,359
control the motion of

00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,280
and it's a little gross sensor and i

00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:06,160
don't remember what application i had on

00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,839
here i was like

00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,839
you know what did i have and so

00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:11,280
microblocks has this awesome feature of

00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,680
the blocks i remember

00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,680
are on the microcontroller and i want to

00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,240
just open from board

00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,280
oops wait before i do this i need to

00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:23,280
share

00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:26,560
never mind okay share your screen

00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:29,599
and let's see

00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:34,079
select window

00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:34,079
blocks and allow

00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:40,160
okay now i'm sharing microblocks okay so

00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,480
this ide again has many languages

00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,319
um you have to get the firmware on a

00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,359
microcontroller once in order to do it

00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:48,839
but right now

00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:50,640
what i want to do is i want to open from

00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:52,800
board and

00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,920
it says to plug in the board so that's

00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,839
i'm going to plug in this

00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,440
board right here into one of my usb

00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:01,680
ports

00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:07,280
and it has a little grove sensor

00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:07,280
servo and plug in the board

00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:13,680
oh sorry i've plugged in the board

00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:15,520
from the wrong place i need to plug it

00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:20,079
into the microcontroller not the extra

00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:23,520
power sensor okay so plug in the board

00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:25,280
whoops there we go now it's reading the

00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,079
project from the board

00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,480
and it's taking the blocks on the board

00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,440
and

00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,000
basically decompiling them and should

00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,560
show me the

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:39,040
blocks on my screen when it's ready

00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:41,599
so how convenient is that and so now i

00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:44,640
can look at my code and say okay

00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:46,720
when i press button a i'm going to move

00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,720
this servo

00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,920
well first of all down when started it

00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,119
it has a you know

00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:56,480
set sets

00:45:53,119 --> 00:46:00,400
pin 2 to or set the servo pin 12

00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:03,440
to a certain amount so if i push if i

00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,440
push the a button

00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:09,440
oh right wait hold on push a and then

00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:12,400
push b

00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,720
it would uh it would move however the

00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,480
servo takes a lot of power

00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:19,200
and it can't drive it off the three

00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:22,319
volts so

00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,920
let me just move this back now i know

00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:26,240
what code is written on here

00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,880
let me just do a quick experiment here

00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:32,560
now i unplug the device

00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:35,280
and it complains and i have to apply the

00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:37,119
power to the board that has the servo

00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,359
now i know what the code looks like and

00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:43,520
i say okay

00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:47,680
press button a what's going to happen

00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:50,640
it spins around b it spins one way and

00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:53,280
a it spins another way and so now i know

00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:56,160
what this does

00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,640
and and i just want to show you the

00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,000
really

00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:03,119
cool part about microblocks is unlike uh

00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,240
make code or some of these other things

00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:09,520
i can do stuff

00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:12,640
um in real time it's live

00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,640
and so i'm going to plug in

00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:19,280
i'm going to plug in an led strip here

00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:22,880
onto another pin and this time again i

00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,880
need to plug into the board

00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:29,680
and then i say you know rather than this

00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:32,079
servo thing i'm just gonna say

00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,079
new

00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:39,839
get rid of that project

00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,680
and i'm going to load the neopixel

00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,680
library

00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,240
again there's a whole bunch of different

00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,359
libraries for different devices and

00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:55,520
things

00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:58,960
and then i'm plugging it into i believe

00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,760
there should be 30 leds on here attached

00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,200
to pin

00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:06,880
two and

00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:10,800
let's start that one started let's

00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:13,920
define that so if that works

00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,760
then we ought to be able to just say set

00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:20,079
all nail pixels to green

00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:23,599
and lo and behold they all turned green

00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:25,200
and so now um you can do all sorts of

00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:28,880
fun things with them you can do

00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:30,960
loops uh you can you know like do from

00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,520
from one to another i could i could

00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:36,559
change the color right here

00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,040
make them all pink and just click the

00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:41,119
block

00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:45,599
and it's live it just does it

00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:45,599
and then this this actual board

00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:51,920
has built-in basic sensors

00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:54,000
like tilt sensors and

00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,359
the acceleration and so forth so if i

00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,319
accelerate it more you'll see those

00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:59,040
differences

00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,440
and it has this cool block of graphing

00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,920
or

00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,520
say that you can use and so you can take

00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:06,800
these sensors like

00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:10,720
the light level and i say

00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:14,400
um you know like forever

00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,400
maybe with a little bit of a weight

00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:21,920
50 milliseconds put that inside the

00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,920
block with the save lock

00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,160
so i have the light level here and now

00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:32,160
if i cover it it goes lower and

00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:35,920
like higher but in addition to say

00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:37,520
i can graph it so let's duplicate this

00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,400
block

00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:43,359
and graph it and then i can have the

00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,359
light level here

00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:49,200
i'm going to put 0 at the bottom

00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:55,280
and let's see if we can play that and

00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:58,240
now

00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,839
if i cover it you see that go down you

00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:02,960
see it go up

00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:05,920
and so now i can look at the light level

00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:07,520
and i could do other things like instead

00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,839
of the light level

00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:15,280
i can do the tilt sensors let's do

00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:18,960
x and then also what whoops

00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,960
i also want to do y

00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,839
and let's just clear this and then i

00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,640
want

00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:27,920
back at zero in the middle and then i

00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:31,680
want to forever

00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:34,559
show x and y and now you can tell if i

00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,559
tilt it one way

00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,680
which sensor and then if i go this

00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:44,160
direction i believe it's the y

00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:48,160
parameter that's in the green one

00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:48,160
and then this one is x

00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:52,160
and then z is flipping all the way

00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,400
around so they're actually a three

00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,160
axis motion sensor and then if i shake

00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,079
it you'll see the

00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:00,319
so there's libraries like for step

00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,920
counts uh step counting and all sorts of

00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:05,359
cool things

00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:08,559
and so this is a really fun absolutely

00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:10,160
like coolest thing in the world

00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:11,839
because it's so live like the first

00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:14,960
thing you do in uh

00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:17,359
arduino is you you know you blink an led

00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:19,520
so this has a little led light that you

00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:20,400
can turn on and off and i can just do

00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,440
that

00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:25,040
and if i could just uh you know pull

00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:29,440
these blocks out

00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:32,880
and forever i can turn the led on

00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:36,160
maybe wait uh

00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:39,040
200 milliseconds

00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:40,079
duplicate these two blocks to turn it

00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:45,040
off

00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:50,319
and then you know when started

00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:52,079
and this is essentially arduino blink

00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:53,359
but of course if i wanted to make it

00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:56,400
more fun

00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:58,240
i do the led display instead of just one

00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:01,280
led

00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:05,440
i pull this

00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:08,480
part out and now i should be doing

00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:12,240
a happy face blink

00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,760
oops wait instead of uh

00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:15,760
so i can just change it in real time

00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,960
when i realize i make a mistake

00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:22,240
clear display instead we'll pull that

00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,520
out so now it's doing the happy face

00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,480
blink

00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:28,240
and so you can realize how how easy it

00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,480
is to do these things

00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:32,240
and then the libraries for web things

00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,480
going back to iot

00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,280
is under network there's this web things

00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,920
library

00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,920
and i click that and i open it

00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,800
and it has a library of things that

00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,359
basically do all of that json

00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:50,000
description behind the scenes for you

00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:50,400
and so now i have uh you know i set a

00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,640
thing

00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:57,520
name i set a capability like a light

00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:59,359
so let's call this a micro box thing and

00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,880
a light and i can just give it a boolean

00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:03,119
property like

00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,000
i have to define at least one variable

00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:07,280
so

00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:11,680
i add a variable called on

00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,680
and then you know i set

00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:17,440
on to you know true or false for

00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:20,400
starters

00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,400
something like this

00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:26,800
and i could even do

00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:27,440
i could even do the the led strip for

00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,960
example

00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,599
to be on or off and then i give this

00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,800
title

00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:39,359
on and then i start

00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,359
the web thing server

00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,720
and then all i would have to do is like

00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:48,319
wherever

00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,319
this becomes a if

00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:57,520
so this becomes if on

00:53:54,160 --> 00:54:01,200
grab the on variable

00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,839
if on i'm going to set all of the new

00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:06,800
cells

00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:06,800
to pink else

00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:15,440
i'm going to clear the neopixels

00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:18,720
so we need an else here i'll

00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:20,319
sif clear nail pixels

00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,400
and then i get rid of all this other

00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:24,800
stuff

00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,440
and so now and and just to be able to

00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,559
test it

00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:32,640
let's do a little control so

00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:35,839
when uh when button a is

00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:37,920
pressed let's toggle on

00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:39,440
to the opposite of itself so let's

00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:43,200
toggle on

00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:45,760
oops to

00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,760
not on

00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:53,359
not variables

00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:55,680
sorry it's hard to do all this

00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:56,640
one-handed while i'm holding this but

00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:00,720
now

00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:04,839
basically uh if i start this program

00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:07,280
it creates a web thing and i

00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:10,000
toggle

00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,799
the button and it goes from on which it

00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,040
started

00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:15,200
to not on and so now there's my toggle

00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:17,359
my button

00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:20,480
and then at the same time if i were just

00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:23,280
to uh

00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:25,760
look at the web thing json let's see

00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:29,280
there's a thing description here

00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:32,160
if i look at that this is what the

00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,359
description in javascript is and i can

00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,280
connect this

00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:36,400
to the raspberry pi and run the micro

00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,400
blocks add-on

00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,880
this doesn't have wi-fi but i could do a

00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,920
radio remote control to one of them

00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,000
connected to the pi

00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,680
and then the other one remote and i have

00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,559
lots of these things

00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:50,559
and and i could do servo motions to open

00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:52,480
or close something i could do lights

00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:53,760
i can do motion detection i could

00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,280
connect one to a door

00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,160
and sense so you can use these

00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,920
microcontrollers to basically create

00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:02,319
all of the different web things that i

00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:05,599
showed you from my commercial devices

00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:07,839
and so i just wanted to show you a few

00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:09,839
of these other devices that i've built

00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:15,200
as web things this is a web thing

00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:19,440
um ir controller and it's a little

00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:22,480
this is the m5 stick

00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,280
6c and so it has a little user interface

00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,520
display

00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,440
and then i can use a remote control to

00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:31,280
to toggle it

00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:33,599
this is um i have a

00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:35,359
couple more micro bits that i just

00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,760
turned one i use for temperature and

00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,839
light

00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,599
and one i use for the lighting going on

00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:42,079
and off just as a button

00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:44,079
press this is another bright led that i

00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:48,319
use

00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:50,559
for things i have my own um

00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:52,559
indoor air quality sensor that i have

00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:54,640
hooked up to a wi-fi device so this is

00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:56,319
also programmed using micro blocks as a

00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:58,720
native device

00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:59,760
this i have set up this is called an m5

00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,880
stack

00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:04,720
and it has a motion sensor pir sensor

00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,920
connected to it so i put this somewhere

00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,319
and this is a battery

00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,960
built in battery so it can run for a

00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:11,359
little while

00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,599
not forever i usually leave it hooked up

00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:17,040
to a battery brick

00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:19,200
and um so all this fun stuff

00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,319
basically becomes build your own iot

00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:23,440
devices

00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:25,040
and then i also have uh so i

00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,880
i'm sorry i don't have it set up but i

00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,880
had all those devices hooked up to this

00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,520
raspberry pi which also has a

00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:34,079
pimmeroni blinked pie hot on it so i can

00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:36,240
do individual colored lights on the

00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:38,160
on the raspberry pi that's running the

00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:39,839
web things gateway directly

00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:42,079
and the way you set these things up is

00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:43,839
just a micro sd card

00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:45,760
you flash it with an image you plug it

00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:47,839
in you boot it on your network you

00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,599
connect it to your local wi-fi

00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,280
you get a domain name so that you can

00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:54,480
access it remotely

00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:57,200
and then boom you're ready to go so the

00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:59,359
last thing i'll mention here of the

00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,680
microblocks is there's all sorts of cool

00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:04,559
fun games and libraries

00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:06,480
if you look you know under under the

00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:07,680
micro bit and the calliope boards you

00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,079
find tons of

00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,599
fun games you can play with it as well

00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:14,880
as music

00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:17,520
and all sorts of things so

00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,160
i could uh i have tons of different

00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:21,119
examples

00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:22,000
there's also just so you know web of

00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:24,400
things has its own

00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,359
examples of how you can set this thing

00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,520
up as a

00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:29,200
heart rate monitor temperature and light

00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:33,680
push button hello led

00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:38,559
ambulance um lots of different things

00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:40,240
so in fact if we do the ambulance thing

00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:42,480
i'll just show you really quick before i

00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:45,520
stop sharing this

00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,520
this has uh

00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:56,079
the ambulance basically uses the

00:58:50,880 --> 00:59:00,880
um let's say that we do the 30 leds

00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:05,760
on pin two and then attach the buzzer

00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:07,839
i think is on pin zero

00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,680
and let's see if we can play that so

00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:11,520
this the red blocks are basically

00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:13,839
setting it up as a web thing

00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:15,980
and then i have button a to toggle it on

00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:17,599
and off

00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:22,880
[Music]

00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:22,880
so this is my little ambulance

00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:28,799
and then talk about it and so this

00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:32,319
actually works as a web thing

00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:37,040
and i will stop sharing

00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:39,760
that okay

00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,400
yeah you have a few questions you can

00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,880
reply

00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,839
to them in the sharing notes on the left

00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:47,680
side of the screen

00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:49,920
okay let's see maybe

00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:52,559
a few minutes if you can all right so in

00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:54,400
the main remaining minutes

00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:57,280
let me go over to the chat window is

00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,280
that where i'm supposed to be

00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:01,839
yes shared notes

01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:08,319
no public chat or just shared notes

01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:12,480
shared notes

01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:12,960
yes right now questions for me okay tour

01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,799
of my

01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:18,079
that is have you written documentations

01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:21,760
or reviews of these different systems

01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:22,960
not really um you know documentation

01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,960
there is a wiki

01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,480
or web things project will take you to

01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,880
the wiki and there's some documentation

01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:31,920
about

01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:31,920
devices we know to work and uh

01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:37,520
my my base recommendation is is look up

01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,280
some of the information if it's a wi-fi

01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,720
device you have to be very careful about

01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,240
whether or not it's getting out to the

01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:45,040
internet or not

01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:47,200
and block it but zigbee or z-wave

01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:50,559
devices or anything that's non-ip is

01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:52,000
is going to be good and then look at the

01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:53,359
add-ons because they will tell you a lot

01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,720
of information about the different

01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:57,119
devices

01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:58,880
is there any major implication when ipv6

01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:01,520
becomes a standard in terms of security

01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:03,760
embedded systems

01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:05,440
uh again in ipv6 you're gonna have to

01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,720
treat it just like wi-fi or anything

01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:09,040
that has an internet

01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:10,720
accessible protocol then you have to

01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,480
know that you're blocking that proto

01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:14,240
you're blocking that device from the

01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:18,240
internet or not

01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:20,240
and uh i think in future versions of the

01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:22,319
web things there's one guy that set up

01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:24,240
the raspberry pi gateway as the access

01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:25,119
point so all the wi-fi devices connect

01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,880
to it

01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:29,200
and then he has an add-on that basically

01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,240
blocks them unless he wants them to talk

01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,920
to the internet

01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:33,359
you know there are future applications

01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,720
where you have an appliance and

01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:36,720
something breaks

01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:38,640
you want the appliance manufacturer to

01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:40,079
be able to remotely

01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:42,319
check the information but it's something

01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:45,520
you just want to turn on for the time

01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:47,440
of that you know remote service call not

01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:50,240
always monitoring what you're washing in

01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:53,680
your washing machine right

01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:55,359
and um and so it really depends on the

01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,559
protocols to investigate that what's

01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:59,599
your opinion

01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:02,319
for is tor hidden service the perfect

01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:04,480
tool for exposing iot home server

01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:06,480
so the current encrypted channel that

01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:09,839
i'm using is it's called it's

01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:12,799
page kite and so it is tunneled

01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:14,319
just to me https only for my username so

01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:16,319
i'm fairly confident with that

01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:17,839
but it does have a cost and right now

01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:19,520
that cost is being beared

01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:21,280
by volunteers and we're trying to turn

01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,240
it into a non-profit that can cover

01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:25,039
those costs

01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:25,440
there's another um tunneling service

01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:27,839
called

01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,039
nkn which is a blockchain distributed

01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,720
service and we're

01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:32,160
and that does work also but it's a

01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,680
little cumbersome to set up so i'm

01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:35,440
hoping we can add an add-on that you

01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:38,640
could use the nkn tunneling

01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:39,359
or you can just you know you can open a

01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,440
port

01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:42,559
um through your own broadband service

01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:45,440
provider

01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:49,119
uh you just have to be very access to

01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:51,280
get into that port

01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:53,680
let's see besides encrypted channel only

01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:55,920
you know the service

01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,960
automatically hacking attacks simply

01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,400
don't know where

01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,079
is your exposed server no one should

01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,680
know you have a smart home right

01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:03,680
yeah i totally agree the smart home

01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:06,559
privacy to me is a

01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:08,480
very important and what worries me about

01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:10,720
what worries me most about these

01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,319
centralized service providers having

01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,640
access to all our smart home data is

01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:15,440
like

01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:17,359
one hack exposes millions of homes at

01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:19,280
least in the case of decentralization

01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:20,799
where each of our homes is a data center

01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,599
they have to hack into one home at a

01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:23,280
time just like

01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:26,000
physically they'd have to hack into one

01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:28,559
home at a time and if you're in russia

01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,520
you know physically accessing my home is

01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:34,000
pretty hard

01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:36,400
and but remote access is easier

01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,799
so i just have to maintain that security

01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,440
of https from the outside as the only

01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:43,280
way to have

01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:44,160
to get in are there iot devices talking

01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:47,920
in a proprietary

01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:49,359
program call will yeah so though how

01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:52,240
does web of things deal with it

01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:53,920
any wireless protocol or messaging

01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:56,960
protocol that's proprietary is

01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:58,400
fine as long as at some point there's an

01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:01,760
api that's

01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:04,319
exposed or can be um you know

01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,799
reverse engineered into getting those

01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:07,280
data

01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:09,520
now there are some that are like nest

01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:11,440
which is like a secure pipe

01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:13,280
from the device to the internet the nest

01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:15,520
internet and back you can't tap

01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,640
into there's no nest add-on because nest

01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:20,079
does not expose

01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:21,680
any information locally and

01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:23,760
it's a real pain to get it from the

01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:26,960
cloud

01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:28,000
um what are the opinions of the home

01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:31,039
assistant project

01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:33,680
so i've i've built one uh

01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:34,079
it wasn't hard to spin up but i found

01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:37,039
that

01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:37,599
um i didn't spend a lot of time of it on

01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:40,000
it because

01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:41,920
it requires all these like tomml

01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,880
configuration files and i really felt

01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,480
like

01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:46,160
the web things is something i could set

01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:49,920
up in my mom's home and my

01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:51,359
cousins and my friends and family and

01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:53,520
it really doesn't require any

01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:55,760
configuration files that

01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:57,119
are difficult like they can then learn

01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,799
just the add-on

01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:00,319
config file it's just a web page and

01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:01,920
they don't have to learn special things

01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:04,400
so for home assistant

01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,000
it's great for there's a lot of

01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,640
flexibility for developers but

01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,680
not a lot of flexibility for non-tech

01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:12,960
people

01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:15,119
is mine my sense maybe it's improved

01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:18,000
since i last tried

01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:20,160
and then data explosion do you think

01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,039
that quote data explosion happens when

01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,799
we

01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:24,319
save this data typically in a cloud

01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:27,680
should our devices be more

01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:29,760
forgetful yes absolutely i would like

01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:32,799
plug something to this question

01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,839
i saw i saw a little bit earlier the the

01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:37,280
detail

01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:38,240
of the data logs in some in one of your

01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:41,680
slides

01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:44,960
and in the perspective of a

01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:47,599
non-technical user uh that is a huge

01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:50,640
amount of data that is being saved

01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:53,359
i'm not using if in a cloud or in our

01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:54,000
laptops or something like that uh what

01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:56,240
would be

01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,920
your opinion about all these concerns

01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:01,839
about privacy and

01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:04,559
data leakage and uh right right

01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:05,119
information being sold in black market

01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:07,680
yeah i

01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:09,119
i don't want my data saved over time i

01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:11,680
have a seven day

01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:13,280
rolling window that where the data just

01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:16,400
purges and rolls off

01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:17,280
there is like an influx db uh add-on so

01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,119
if you're an

01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,880
industrial setting or a you know

01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:22,960
commercial setting you might want to

01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:26,720
store data but you might want to

01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:29,680
do it as a um whether those uh

01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:31,520
rdb the the sort of where it crunches

01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:33,440
the data the older it gets

01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:35,359
might be a way to log it i personally

01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:37,119
for smart home use i think you should

01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:38,559
throw it away unless there's some real

01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:41,359
good reason to to keep

01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:42,240
track of it and someone else wrote an ad

01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:43,599
on time in

01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,280
in the netherlands where you can

01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:47,359
actually set up periods of time where

01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,359
it's not logging data from a privacy

01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:51,119
standpoint like when my house

01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:52,799
keeping service is home i don't want to

01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:54,319
keep track of everything while they're

01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,960
in here and so i just have it not

01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:57,200
logging

01:06:54,960 --> 01:07:00,160
during those times and so i think we

01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:02,720
really need to enable consumers to

01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:03,280
keep very careful track of what is being

01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,839
logged

01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,400
and the privacy implications there's a

01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:09,440
lot of

01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:10,960
things to be done thank you

01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,480
and then what other cloud services can

01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,960
use other than google cloud to

01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:16,480
potentiate the features and usability

01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,559
oh well i don't think we need to use

01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:20,319
commercial clouds at all in my case

01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:21,839
you know i think we should all be our

01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:25,440
own clouds

01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:27,920
and uh run things locally

01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:30,000
and other online services even if you

01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:31,200
trust the vendor of it the vendor can

01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,520
get hacked as well

01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:35,039
so you have to be careful is there a way

01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,559
to set up a secondary pie to take over

01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:38,799
in case the main one will fail

01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:39,680
yeah it's as easy as just backing up

01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:43,119
this this

01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:44,960
certain web things i o directory i back

01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:46,880
that up periodically and then

01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,880
you can just bring up a brand new pie

01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:50,559
and just upload that directory and your

01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:53,839
whole pie is back to normal

01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:55,599
so um there's also satellites that

01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:57,359
someone has done for the voice control

01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:59,359
so you can have satellite voice control

01:07:57,359 --> 01:08:01,359
in different rooms

01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:02,640
any hardware kit already pre-installed

01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:06,160
yes okay do

01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:09,200
actually has um okdo.com has a web

01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:12,960
things gateway raspberry pi 4 kit

01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:15,440
but it's only the raspberry pi part um

01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:16,880
and then on top of that i would just get

01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:18,640
a zigbee

01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:21,359
adapter and a bunch of zigbee devices

01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:23,359
you can buy from my ikea or anything

01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:25,839
can you show add-on for a cat we use

01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:28,239
microblocks to write it

01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:29,359
i don't have to time to show a cat and i

01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:32,480
don't know what you wanted

01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:35,040
exactly but microblocks for writing

01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:37,279
your own iot devices is really cool is

01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:39,199
super fun

01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,640
i highly encourage people to play around

01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:42,880
with it and

01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,679
there's a wiki on microblocks that has

01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,440
um

01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:47,520
a little information about how to set up

01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:49,759
the raspberry pi gateway and then

01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,839
a few basic web things applications you

01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:53,920
can write with it

01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:56,159
so sorry i

01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:57,440
blabbed too much and ran out of my time

01:08:56,159 --> 01:09:00,159
but uh

01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:02,000
i hope hope you got some fun out of it

01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:05,199
yes absolutely thank you

01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,400
kathy and we're going now for another

01:09:05,199 --> 01:09:21,839
short break

01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:21,839
all right thank you all bye-bye

01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:13,180
[Music]

01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:28,649
[Music]

01:36:35,679 --> 01:36:41,520
hello hello welcome back everyone

01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:42,560
i really hope that you have enjoyed all

01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:46,000
the sessions

01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:49,199
and all the talks today uh we are

01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:51,280
so happy to have our next presenter

01:36:49,199 --> 01:36:52,639
talking about sandboxing your data with

01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:56,400
tracker

01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:56,400
by carlos garnatro

01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:02,239
and i hope you enjoy the presentation

01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:07,840
and

01:37:02,239 --> 01:37:07,840
good luck to you carlos

01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:15,119
thank you christine so there

01:37:12,639 --> 01:37:17,679
so there's a small introduction i'm

01:37:15,119 --> 01:37:21,119
carlos carmezo maybe

01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:23,119
you don't all know me i've been a very

01:37:21,119 --> 01:37:25,600
long time contributor to

01:37:23,119 --> 01:37:28,400
to be known and for a less long time

01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:31,840
i've been working at work

01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:34,880
so yeah well this talk is about tracker

01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:38,159
tracker maybe you've heard of it

01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:40,480
briefly or you've had some experience

01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:40,480
with it

01:37:42,239 --> 01:37:46,159
it has a long story well it's it was a

01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:51,040
file

01:37:46,159 --> 01:37:51,040
system and metadata indexer

01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:55,760
which became a file system and metadata

01:37:54,239 --> 01:37:58,639
indexer

01:37:55,760 --> 01:38:00,320
uh trusting in a cool technology and

01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:02,239
which became a cool technology

01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:04,000
surrounded by a fire system and

01:38:02,239 --> 01:38:08,080
metabolic dresser

01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:11,600
so i'm talking about this the core

01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:14,159
thing of tracker and i trust

01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:16,320
maybe you don't know that much about it

01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:19,520
about how it works internally so

01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:22,800
well i've approached this talk so

01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:25,520
you go from can go from

01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:27,040
not knowing that much about tracker to

01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:29,119
having a reasonable

01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:30,800
understanding of how it works and how it

01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:33,119
approaches

01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:35,199
storing data and how it approaches

01:38:33,119 --> 01:38:38,080
sharing data with others and

01:38:35,199 --> 01:38:38,080
how it can be used

01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:45,040
so yeah well i have quite a lot of

01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:46,480
slides to go through so let's face

01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:50,560
through it

01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:50,560
uh so rdf is uh

01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:59,119
is the the core

01:38:55,840 --> 01:39:00,159
storage of tracker it stands for

01:38:59,119 --> 01:39:05,040
resource

01:39:00,159 --> 01:39:06,880
description framework and

01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:09,280
well it describes perhaps some

01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:13,199
information we'll get

01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:15,600
more in there about that

01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:16,239
and it's one important thing to note is

01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:19,119
that it's

01:39:16,239 --> 01:39:19,760
more of a concept not a specific format

01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:22,560
it's not

01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:23,440
xml the total location of the input

01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:26,159
there's

01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:26,639
infinite ways to to represent every f

01:39:26,159 --> 01:39:29,760
and

01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:33,040
there the rdf is not tied to any

01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:37,840
so it can also be

01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:37,840
stored like we do so

01:39:38,239 --> 01:39:42,400
and uh well as i said it describes

01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:45,760
russian for

01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:48,159
mason and the basic unit of it is a

01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:48,159
triple

01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:58,880
and what is a triple so yeah

01:39:55,840 --> 01:40:02,300
consists of subject

01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:03,679
and predicate and object

01:40:02,300 --> 01:40:06,719
[Music]

01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:11,199
so here we can see it's a

01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:14,800
big turtle to represent it

01:40:11,199 --> 01:40:17,520
this would be how you can see

01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:19,920
in some places how tripods represent uh

01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:23,280
it can be compacted in different ways or

01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:26,320
what it can but let's take this

01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:27,199
this representation so here these two

01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:30,800
things

01:40:27,199 --> 01:40:31,119
they represent information themselves

01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:34,880
and

01:40:31,119 --> 01:40:39,920
well we can see that

01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:39,920
the subject can be an uri

01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:48,840
but also a black node but let's

01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:51,920
not get into that well they are

01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:54,639
simply just ways to represent

01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:56,480
an english data and whatnot it's not

01:40:54,639 --> 01:41:00,639
worth to talk about them

01:40:56,480 --> 01:41:00,639
the predicate can be an uri

01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:08,719
and the object can be an uri

01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:12,159
or a literal value

01:41:08,719 --> 01:41:14,880
and this is essentially how

01:41:12,159 --> 01:41:16,239
we can imagine this information this

01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:21,199
could be two nodes

01:41:16,239 --> 01:41:21,199
tied by a by an edge

01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:29,119
the the predicate is a label to the edge

01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:29,760
and the edge has an arrow so we this is

01:41:29,119 --> 01:41:33,600
why

01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:37,840
you can read somewhere that rdf is a

01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:37,840
labeled directed graph

01:41:39,140 --> 01:41:43,600
[Music]

01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:45,520
so the important thing to note is that

01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:49,440
triples work by composition

01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:49,440
so so yeah you can

01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:56,639
you here have the basic unit so

01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:57,130
you can put them together and for

01:41:56,639 --> 01:41:58,840
example

01:41:57,130 --> 01:42:01,440
[Music]

01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:04,880
here we can describe

01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:07,119
here on the on the right hand we have

01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:08,560
the early f describing the graph that

01:42:07,119 --> 01:42:10,639
i'm painting on

01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:11,840
on the left side so we can say that for

01:42:10,639 --> 01:42:17,600
example the song is

01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:17,600
a song we give it a duration

01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:21,199
and we'll give it a title

01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:25,679
we give it an artist and the artist can

01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:28,719
be a note

01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:32,159
on itself so uh

01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:34,880
yeah well too many conversion formats

01:42:32,159 --> 01:42:38,159
i'm missing some

01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:41,520
some about this over here never mind

01:42:38,159 --> 01:42:43,840
so yeah the artist can be an album

01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:46,560
itself so we can say that the artist

01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:46,560
is an artist

01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:50,639
and we can give him a name

01:42:51,119 --> 01:42:57,040
etc etc so

01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:58,320
yeah for example here we are relating

01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:01,280
the song to a file

01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:04,080
to a physical file and we for example

01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:07,280
are relating the file back to the song

01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:10,639
so this is how you construct uh the

01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:13,760
ldf and how it becomes a graph

01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:15,119
it doesn't mind it doesn't matter what

01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:17,760
you start form

01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:19,760
or what order you put it that the

01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:21,199
resulting effect is the same you you get

01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:25,840
the same graph

01:43:21,199 --> 01:43:25,840
based on on this enemy of the earth

01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:33,320
[Music]

01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:37,040
but we are not a

01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:41,440
shapeless metadata store we don't

01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:42,639
store arbitrary data or typos or or

01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:46,880
things like that

01:43:42,639 --> 01:43:50,840
things need a structure

01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:53,840
for example here well let's go through

01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:53,840
that

01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:59,280
and what do we need for that uh this is

01:43:58,159 --> 01:44:02,400
what we use

01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:06,000
ontologies for uh andrology well these

01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:09,199
another of these passwords that

01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:11,119
take a bit long to describe but

01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:13,040
let's go to the basics and they are

01:44:11,119 --> 01:44:15,920
basically the description

01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:18,320
of the yellow data and they allow us to

01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:18,320
define

01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:23,119
classes and properties

01:44:24,239 --> 01:44:29,040
the classes would be in the example

01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:29,040
before

01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:38,080
going back ugh

01:44:35,199 --> 01:44:39,119
this is slower than expected here would

01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:41,520
be

01:44:39,119 --> 01:44:44,639
the classes would be telling that you

01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:47,199
you store songs and you

01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:49,360
you you get your story the ability to

01:44:47,199 --> 01:44:50,960
sort to store songs so you define a

01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:54,960
class for some sort you

01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:57,360
give your ontology the ability to store

01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:58,000
artists so you define a class for

01:44:57,360 --> 01:45:03,040
artists

01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:06,560
and the properties would be uh

01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:17,840
the properties that can be

01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:17,840
created on resources of these classes

01:45:19,350 --> 01:45:24,320
[Music]

01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:26,800
yeah going forward again so yeah and

01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:28,400
for example we have other things that we

01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:32,719
can

01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:34,719
define an entity like for example well

01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:36,239
justifying classes and properties is not

01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:39,760
enough so

01:45:36,239 --> 01:45:41,679
yeah we can actually say the

01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:42,880
the frames of these properties the

01:45:41,679 --> 01:45:45,920
frames would be

01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:48,480
basically what kind of resource can

01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:50,080
these several point to so we can define

01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:51,600
for example that duration in this

01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:54,719
example here can

01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:58,000
can be an integer but

01:45:54,719 --> 01:46:00,159
so this would be uh there's

01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:02,480
also a missing check mark over here this

01:46:00,159 --> 01:46:05,679
would be a valid node

01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:07,040
uh that would be a load into the into

01:46:05,679 --> 01:46:10,400
the database because the

01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:12,719
the ontology defines that duration

01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:15,199
is an integer but for example if we

01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:18,000
insert some string

01:46:15,199 --> 01:46:18,480
it would be something that's allowed so

01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:21,600
we

01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:25,040
keep consistency that way

01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:26,639
and there's also we can also define the

01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:29,679
cardinality of these properties

01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:32,480
for example you know getting back to the

01:46:29,679 --> 01:46:32,480
topic of songs

01:46:33,119 --> 01:46:36,560
one album can have many songs that's uh

01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:39,440
one

01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:40,560
so each song can only have one duration

01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:44,000
so this could be

01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:44,480
a lot but trying to insert multiple

01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,320
nodes

01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:48,159
with different data that would be

01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:53,119
incoherent so

01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:55,119
that would be this allowed that would be

01:46:53,119 --> 01:46:57,040
there's also a four-bedroom mark over

01:46:55,119 --> 01:46:59,540
here

01:46:57,040 --> 01:47:01,119
yeah it's eight of all my emojis

01:46:59,540 --> 01:47:04,239
[Music]

01:47:01,119 --> 01:47:06,560
so yeah and in the intelligence you can

01:47:04,239 --> 01:47:06,560
also

01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:13,679
also set up the indexes and

01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:17,440
other other miscellaneous data like the

01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:17,440
documentation of the ontology itself

01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:24,719
and other things like defining full text

01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:27,280
search properties so you can quickly

01:47:24,719 --> 01:47:31,840
search through text

01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:36,239
on specific properties or other

01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:39,119
other characteristics of the database

01:47:36,239 --> 01:47:41,040
and one important thing to note is that

01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:42,000
alternatives were also the final on top

01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:45,360
of rdf

01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:48,639
and this is an ldf store so we

01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:49,679
are actually the ontology is actually

01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:53,119
introspectible

01:47:49,679 --> 01:47:55,679
so well i'm not going back that many

01:47:53,119 --> 01:47:55,679
slides but

01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:59,600
as i pointed out before that the

01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:02,880
property can be an

01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:06,239
uri so the property can also

01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:09,119
can also be a node with other properties

01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:12,080
and definition and whatnot and you can

01:48:09,119 --> 01:48:14,480
the language allows to worry all of this

01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:14,480
neatly

01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:22,560
yeah and back to the

01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:24,960
talking about the language so sparkle

01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:26,159
is actually the core technology of

01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:33,440
tracker

01:48:26,159 --> 01:48:36,480
and it's a query language for rdf graphs

01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:40,000
it is uh it was part 2.

01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:41,140
1.1 is a w3c recommendation

01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:43,199
from 2017

01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:46,080
[Music]

01:48:43,199 --> 01:48:48,239
it hasn't been seen that many updates

01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:51,840
since

01:48:48,239 --> 01:48:54,880
so it's pretty stable and well

01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:58,560
it has some dark corners but

01:48:54,880 --> 01:49:01,840
what doesn't so yeah it's overall

01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:04,480
a pretty solid base for

01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:04,480
for tracker

01:49:05,199 --> 01:49:12,400
and how does a very language

01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:14,320
that is based on graphs work

01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:15,440
it does work by specifying rough

01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:18,800
patterns so

01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:22,159
what you do actually in sparkle

01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:24,000
would be uh here it is for here's for

01:49:22,159 --> 01:49:27,119
example an example but here i'm not

01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:30,320
going to get that much into

01:49:27,119 --> 01:49:32,960
into the the language itself i didn't

01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:33,520
to get to technical here but here's for

01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:37,679
example

01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:37,679
an example that's

01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:45,440
that is basically defining a triple

01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:46,320
with a placeholder which is a question

01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:48,639
marquee

01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:49,760
which is a variable which we are

01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:53,440
retrieving here

01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:56,639
so we are actually saying that

01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:59,679
the predicate must be x title

01:49:56,639 --> 01:50:03,040
and the object must be y

01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:05,840
so the only way to satisfy this

01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:07,199
it would be in this case of this graph

01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:10,880
it would be some one

01:50:07,199 --> 01:50:13,040
so but the important thing of the

01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:14,239
this graph patterns is that they would

01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:16,880
match

01:50:14,239 --> 01:50:17,520
anything that goes with that graph

01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:20,800
pattern

01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:23,679
in in your graph so any song

01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:24,719
which would have that the title would be

01:50:23,679 --> 01:50:26,320
returned

01:50:24,719 --> 01:50:28,719
by this query

01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:32,080
[Music]

01:50:28,719 --> 01:50:33,760
and there's many other ways to retrieve

01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:35,840
data and to worry around

01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:37,119
and whatnot for example this other query

01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:40,400
is also

01:50:37,119 --> 01:50:44,320
a aggregate pattern that matches this

01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:46,719
orange smart triple

01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:47,840
but we are retrieving the type and the

01:50:46,719 --> 01:50:51,440
predicate

01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:55,599
here so yeah well we we are basically

01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:55,599
asking the title of the song someone

01:50:56,719 --> 01:51:02,960
and so on so forth uh

01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:04,480
here we are asking the title for any

01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:07,679
song

01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:10,239
that has a title and would match

01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:10,880
someone here but it will so much any

01:51:10,239 --> 01:51:14,400
song and

01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:14,400
review the titles and songs

01:51:15,119 --> 01:51:21,599
and as i said this is introspectible

01:51:18,639 --> 01:51:23,040
so we can ask for the properties and

01:51:21,599 --> 01:51:26,320
this

01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:27,599
anything and what property has the

01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:29,840
object why

01:51:27,599 --> 01:51:32,000
so we can in this case it would tell us

01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:35,840
that someone has a title

01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:35,840
that is y

01:51:36,159 --> 01:51:43,760
so yeah there's many ways to

01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:46,880
this is a very complete language uh

01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:49,840
here's for example uh

01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:50,560
trying to match uh well matching uh more

01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:53,840
complex

01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:54,960
graph notes like saying yeah this artist

01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:58,000
must be

01:51:54,960 --> 01:52:00,719
a a here is used as a placeholder which

01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:01,119
would match this and we get we say that

01:52:00,719 --> 01:52:04,320
the

01:52:01,119 --> 01:52:06,480
name must be yo so

01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:07,920
it sets the connection between the nodes

01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:11,199
and we get

01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:11,199
u which would be someone

01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:17,040
so yeah and there's actually many ways

01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:20,159
to do

01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:24,560
this uh really sparkle is a very

01:52:20,159 --> 01:52:27,679
complete language uh done for this task

01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:31,840
so yeah i was also

01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:31,840
talking about sparkle

01:52:32,950 --> 01:52:38,880
[Music]

01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:41,679
yeah in in this time frame

01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:42,320
it would be crazy it's a it's a complex

01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:45,840
language

01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:45,840
about the

01:52:56,840 --> 01:53:02,400
and yeah well

01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:02,400
uh the

01:53:05,199 --> 01:53:11,119
the sparkle language can also

01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:12,960
work on multiple graphs say it doesn't

01:53:11,119 --> 01:53:16,400
i've been talking about

01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:19,199
graph in singular or perhaps in

01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:20,159
indeterminate plural but it cannot

01:53:19,199 --> 01:53:22,960
actually work on

01:53:20,159 --> 01:53:24,400
multiple graphs it by default has an

01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:27,520
anonymous graph

01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:29,119
which has no name and it has other name

01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:32,080
graphs that

01:53:29,119 --> 01:53:32,880
it also has a graph keyword in the query

01:53:32,080 --> 01:53:35,840
language and

01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:36,159
different ways to put graphs so you can

01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:40,400
do

01:53:36,159 --> 01:53:45,199
unions on them and whatnot and

01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:45,199
how this works really is uh well

01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:50,639
you you have also my composition it

01:53:49,199 --> 01:53:53,920
works by composition you

01:53:50,639 --> 01:53:56,080
layer your products and they can talk

01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:58,880
about the same things or they can

01:53:56,080 --> 01:54:01,119
talk about uh different isolated things

01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:01,119
or

01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:07,599
really the data different triples can be

01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:10,000
in different in multiple graphs at the

01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:13,280
same time

01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:14,960
there's different ways to store the data

01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:22,639
to use graphs and to

01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:26,639
mix them and whatnot

01:54:22,639 --> 01:54:30,470
but it also allows federated queries

01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:33,599
and can work across remote services

01:54:30,470 --> 01:54:37,360
[Music]

01:54:33,599 --> 01:54:41,040
and how does this work i'm luckily

01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:43,280
well luckily it it works

01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:45,760
very similarly because i'm lazy with my

01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:45,760
assets

01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:51,920
and and yeah well

01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:53,520
it works pretty much the same by

01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:57,679
composition so you

01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:59,040
you have a local data and you have

01:54:57,679 --> 01:55:02,639
remote data and you can

01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:06,239
query it you can actually merge it

01:55:02,639 --> 01:55:09,440
everything is an uri every every

01:55:06,239 --> 01:55:12,560
node in the graph is an uri so

01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:14,560
you can uniquely identify things between

01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:15,520
services and match them together and

01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:18,239
retrieve

01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:19,760
data from other services that match your

01:55:18,239 --> 01:55:22,800
your local data

01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:22,800
and whatnot and

01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:31,520
and one important thing to know

01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:31,920
is that sparkle is a language made from

01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:34,960
an

01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:35,679
unreliable web which means that yeah

01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:39,280
well

01:55:35,679 --> 01:55:42,000
the web can is not static it's very far

01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:42,000
from it and

01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:49,599
yeah well services can go offline

01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:52,159
data can change that is out of your

01:55:49,599 --> 01:55:52,159
control

01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:57,280
there can be data migrations that change

01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:00,400
to different formats

01:55:57,280 --> 01:56:04,719
that you weren't observing first and

01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:07,440
sparkle is made to be

01:56:04,719 --> 01:56:08,560
fairly safe in these situations you can

01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:12,800
safely

01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:14,639
fail or what what happens simply in

01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:16,080
at the body level is that the graph

01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:18,159
pattern if

01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:20,000
it doesn't match anything it doesn't

01:56:18,159 --> 01:56:24,400
return anything so

01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:28,719
you don't have a service access failures

01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:32,800
or or you don't get

01:56:28,719 --> 01:56:36,080
uh yeah well library errors

01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:39,360
from from from it just because uh

01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:42,080
data is is not

01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:43,599
in the format that you expect that's a

01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:46,639
so

01:56:43,599 --> 01:56:51,440
so it's a query language say

01:56:46,639 --> 01:56:53,679
that is thought for uh for yeah for

01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:58,159
for variety landscapes and different

01:56:53,679 --> 01:56:58,159
data moving around and changing

01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:06,800
so a bit more on topic

01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:10,159
so tracker i have finally make it

01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:12,480
made it here so

01:57:10,159 --> 01:57:13,520
tracker is a an implementation of a

01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:18,000
triple store and an

01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:18,000
rdf store with swarf 1.1

01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:28,880
support

01:57:25,119 --> 01:57:31,360
it's it's fairly compact

01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:33,040
it's fairly fast and it's quite

01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:35,679
versatile you can

01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:37,440
create your private databases you can

01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:38,000
create in memory databases you can

01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:41,599
access

01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:44,000
remote services you can it's got all the

01:57:41,599 --> 01:57:46,159
spark well tools that could be expected

01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,159
from

01:57:46,639 --> 01:57:49,040
from it

01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:58,560
and it's suitable for private data

01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:59,760
everything i talk about about talking

01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:02,639
about to

01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:03,760
other services and whatnot it's really

01:58:02,639 --> 01:58:07,920
optional to use

01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:12,880
we are actually based on sql

01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:12,880
lite3 so yeah it's

01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:20,400
it's uh yeah it's made

01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:21,360
to be actually tracker started in the

01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:25,679
mobile world

01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:30,239
so yeah it's meant to be fast and

01:58:25,679 --> 01:58:31,599
it's also focused on on

01:58:30,239 --> 01:58:33,520
on having you create your own

01:58:31,599 --> 01:58:34,880
connections right now at least with

01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:36,719
tracker 3

01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:39,119
so you can create your own connections

01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:42,239
where you can define the dermatology and

01:58:39,119 --> 01:58:44,239
you you have your own local data which

01:58:42,239 --> 01:58:45,280
you don't share with anyone so

01:58:44,239 --> 01:58:47,119
everything

01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:49,840
on top about talking to other services

01:58:47,119 --> 01:58:49,840
everything is optional

01:58:54,239 --> 01:59:03,440
and yeah well end points and

01:58:57,440 --> 01:59:07,360
portals this would be a

01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:07,360
about the purpose of the talk which

01:59:08,159 --> 01:59:12,480
here and with the points this as i said

01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:17,119
the

01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:21,040
tracker goes private by default uh it

01:59:17,119 --> 01:59:23,360
creates a a local

01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:24,080
like the the tracker spark or connection

01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:26,159
view

01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:27,199
creates a local database which you

01:59:26,159 --> 01:59:30,960
specify

01:59:27,199 --> 01:59:30,960
which directory it is in

01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:36,400
so an end point would be a something on

01:59:34,639 --> 01:59:39,280
top that actually makes

01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:40,400
that database exported outside on the

01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:43,599
outside

01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:44,239
so that could be the not work but here

01:59:43,599 --> 01:59:47,599
for the

01:59:44,239 --> 01:59:50,800
purpose of portals actually the

01:59:47,599 --> 01:59:53,199
assumption we as i remember you might

01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:53,199
remember

01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:58,719
[Music]

01:59:55,520 --> 02:00:01,679
sorry as you may remember the

01:59:58,719 --> 02:00:03,199
the network uh well the the sparkle

02:00:01,679 --> 02:00:05,360
language

02:00:03,199 --> 02:00:06,239
is network oriented so here we are

02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:10,080
something and

02:00:06,239 --> 02:00:10,080
that gets the bus so

02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:19,199
and we said about earlier before

02:00:15,119 --> 02:00:19,199
uh about

02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:26,159
about a spark well being made for an

02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:28,960
unreliable

02:00:26,159 --> 02:00:31,199
network and unreliable conditions so

02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:34,239
here we are changing with portals

02:00:31,199 --> 02:00:34,239
the approach for it

02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:39,599
it's being random to it being actually

02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:43,760
constrained and actively constrained

02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:43,760
so so what we have

02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:52,400
what we have is a a

02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:53,040
a portal service that is actually a

02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:55,520
proxy

02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:56,719
between the client the sandbox clients

02:00:55,520 --> 02:01:00,000
and the

02:00:56,719 --> 02:01:03,040
services the sparkle services

02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:06,320
and the

02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:06,320
you can actually define

02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:14,639
on on the flatback info

02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:18,639
what what

02:01:14,639 --> 02:01:21,119
data is available for the

02:01:18,639 --> 02:01:22,320
for the sandbox application you can

02:01:21,119 --> 02:01:26,480
define which devas

02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:30,159
service is it able

02:01:26,480 --> 02:01:34,840
uh to talk to and what graphs

02:01:30,159 --> 02:01:38,080
uh what debate service as in spark world

02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:40,960
endpoints and

02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:42,080
what graphs it is able to talk to to see

02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:45,520
in them

02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:45,520
so yeah you

02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:53,040
you basically define what data is

02:01:51,280 --> 02:01:54,719
your application able to see on the

02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:58,080
outside of the flat pack

02:01:54,719 --> 02:02:00,320
and of course you can use tracker

02:01:58,080 --> 02:02:02,840
locally inside the flat pack for your

02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:05,840
own use and

02:02:02,840 --> 02:02:05,840
everything

02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:12,400
so what would happen here

02:02:09,119 --> 02:02:15,599
more emoji's missing so

02:02:12,400 --> 02:02:19,119
what would happen here is that

02:02:15,599 --> 02:02:19,920
yeah this could be the red rectangle

02:02:19,119 --> 02:02:23,760
would be an

02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:23,760
inaccessible graph and

02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:28,719
and the green rectangle would be an

02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:31,840
accessible graph

02:02:28,719 --> 02:02:34,320
so what would happen in

02:02:31,840 --> 02:02:35,920
essence is that every node that is in

02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:40,480
the inaccessible graphs

02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:42,719
is invisible so you have the

02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:45,280
graphs you can access they have their

02:02:42,719 --> 02:02:47,840
own coherent information and they don't

02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:49,920
need to rely on other graphs to do that

02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:52,159
you can merge them and they provide more

02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:55,199
complete information and everything

02:02:52,159 --> 02:02:56,159
but it is not necessary and you can can

02:02:55,199 --> 02:02:58,159
constraint

02:02:56,159 --> 02:03:01,040
your access to specific graphs so here

02:02:58,159 --> 02:03:03,679
for example we we don't

02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:04,080
want you to know information about songs

02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:05,679
but

02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:07,920
you don't we don't want you to know

02:03:05,679 --> 02:03:15,840
information about everything else

02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:15,840
so it can be done

02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:19,360
and yeah let's try to do other more

02:03:18,080 --> 02:03:20,970
about this

02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:23,280
maybe

02:03:20,970 --> 02:03:28,850
[Music]

02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:31,899
it makes things a bit clearer

02:03:28,850 --> 02:03:31,899
[Music]

02:03:37,119 --> 02:03:39,360
okay

02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:47,920
so yeah so this is

02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:47,920
uh working stuff these

02:03:48,719 --> 02:03:52,079
these are flat packs from

02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:57,840
from flat half i think

02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:11,500
and i'm going to use you know music and

02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:15,859
again photos as an example

02:04:11,500 --> 02:04:15,859
[Music]

02:04:16,079 --> 02:04:20,079
so here yeah we can dance

02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:28,239
music it shows music

02:04:25,679 --> 02:04:28,239
that's great

02:04:29,599 --> 02:04:33,760
okay that's perfect so yeah here i'm

02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:37,440
inside the

02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:40,640
the flatback and

02:04:37,440 --> 02:04:44,639
tracker three tool so yeah

02:04:40,640 --> 02:04:47,280
[Music]

02:04:44,639 --> 02:04:48,560
here i'm trying to talk to the tracker

02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:53,440
miner

02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:56,480
which uses a a track point uh

02:04:53,440 --> 02:05:00,159
to expose its data and the one

02:04:56,480 --> 02:05:07,840
important thing to know here is like

02:05:00,159 --> 02:05:07,840
as i pointed before

02:05:08,719 --> 02:05:15,599
here below

02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:20,079
it would be the the policy for

02:05:15,599 --> 02:05:23,119
foreign music to access only

02:05:20,079 --> 02:05:26,159
all the files so

02:05:23,119 --> 02:05:30,880
the thing is that yeah well

02:05:26,159 --> 02:05:30,880
we specify because this is

02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:35,760
all generic so yeah tracker miners is a

02:05:34,159 --> 02:05:39,360
tracker endpoint but

02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:42,400
there could be also other

02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:43,040
other services that use this and the

02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:46,560
flatback

02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:49,679
could be accessing

02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:50,320
those session services in in a sandbox

02:05:49,679 --> 02:05:54,960
other

02:05:50,320 --> 02:05:58,159
so yeah here we have to specify that the

02:05:54,960 --> 02:06:01,360
the minor but and we say that

02:05:58,159 --> 02:06:04,320
it's audiograph is

02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:06,079
what the only thing it can access so

02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:10,150
let's try this

02:06:06,079 --> 02:06:12,079
and let's see that and

02:06:10,150 --> 02:06:14,880
[Music]

02:06:12,079 --> 02:06:16,800
and try to see if i can access

02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:19,700
photographs

02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:23,440
for example so

02:06:19,700 --> 02:06:30,000
[Music]

02:06:23,440 --> 02:06:33,630
we can say

02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:37,199
yeah there's nothing but however

02:06:33,630 --> 02:06:40,400
[Music]

02:06:37,199 --> 02:06:44,050
here's some data let's

02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:52,639
try to confirm let's print the url

02:06:44,050 --> 02:06:56,079
[Music]

02:06:52,639 --> 02:07:01,199
yeah this is music yeah

02:06:56,079 --> 02:07:01,199
mp3 is perfect so it can see

02:07:01,599 --> 02:07:08,719
music but no photos

02:07:05,040 --> 02:07:08,719
so let's go for example to

02:07:09,119 --> 02:07:15,119
the photographs to the photos the the

02:07:12,400 --> 02:07:15,119
digno map

02:07:21,679 --> 02:07:27,840
and here it should happen the opposite

02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:54,210
[Music]

02:07:47,360 --> 02:08:01,020
okay here we get stuff for photos

02:07:54,210 --> 02:08:01,020
[Music]

02:08:02,079 --> 02:08:09,130
etc that's cool and

02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:11,599
let's try the same with music

02:08:09,130 --> 02:08:15,840
[Music]

02:08:11,599 --> 02:08:19,599
so yeah i'm unable to

02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:23,199
to access music so so yeah

02:08:19,599 --> 02:08:25,679
this is

02:08:23,199 --> 02:08:26,480
this is actually i'm now outside the

02:08:25,679 --> 02:08:30,079
sandbox

02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:37,840
and i could be able to to access

02:08:30,079 --> 02:08:37,840
all of it essentially so

02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:45,040
so here's photos and here's

02:08:42,430 --> 02:08:51,760
[Music]

02:08:45,040 --> 02:08:56,079
and here's the music so yeah

02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:58,639
this way you have uh

02:08:56,079 --> 02:08:59,440
well what what tracker miners do that's

02:08:58,639 --> 02:09:04,560
a in

02:08:59,440 --> 02:09:08,079
in this case is having

02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:10,880
a well it's

02:09:08,079 --> 02:09:11,920
fulfilling the information it knows that

02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:14,000
we want

02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:14,960
to do to compartmentalize the

02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:18,400
information in

02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:20,239
different graphs so it's essentially

02:09:18,400 --> 02:09:22,239
writes on its graph and then

02:09:20,239 --> 02:09:22,639
applications can access one of the other

02:09:22,239 --> 02:09:25,760
but

02:09:22,639 --> 02:09:30,560
not all of them all together and

02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:30,560
again all these things they are

02:09:30,840 --> 02:09:36,000
free for use for private use for your

02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:40,560
application or for uh

02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:43,599
session services that might make use of

02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:47,119
of complex stores that

02:09:43,599 --> 02:09:49,360
or or that might make use of

02:09:47,119 --> 02:09:51,840
actually complex queries from the

02:09:49,360 --> 02:09:51,840
outside

02:09:54,560 --> 02:10:02,000
and yeah

02:09:57,920 --> 02:10:06,400
and there's more i mean uh

02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:08,719
sparkle is also very much about uh

02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:09,760
being able to access the data in in

02:10:08,719 --> 02:10:13,360
every

02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:16,880
combination and way so you can it's

02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:18,719
pretty complete to do from data times uh

02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:22,159
circularization conversion

02:10:18,719 --> 02:10:25,360
to other ontologies and other formats

02:10:22,159 --> 02:10:27,920
that there's a quite some

02:10:25,360 --> 02:10:29,520
lots of mobilities over there that are

02:10:27,920 --> 02:10:31,840
useful

02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:33,520
and of course that could help with

02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:36,480
importing exporting data between

02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:43,199
applications that they change

02:10:36,480 --> 02:10:47,599
sharing some data or whatever

02:10:43,199 --> 02:10:51,920
but the next slide yeah

02:10:47,599 --> 02:10:54,560
but also it's got some

02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:55,199
network transparency i think yeah you

02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:57,440
you have

02:10:55,199 --> 02:10:59,840
you can query your own data you can

02:10:57,440 --> 02:11:03,599
carry your other services

02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:03,599
with a service keyword

02:11:04,719 --> 02:11:11,920
and that could be used for

02:11:08,159 --> 02:11:15,679
for in well also tracker 3.1

02:11:11,920 --> 02:11:19,199
uh turns recently a

02:11:15,679 --> 02:11:21,840
and it's http endpoint implementation so

02:11:19,199 --> 02:11:22,400
you you can actually again this is

02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:24,800
optional

02:11:22,400 --> 02:11:26,960
everything is optional but you can

02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:30,000
export your data

02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:31,440
actually on on the local network or on

02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:35,920
that site so that

02:11:31,440 --> 02:11:37,760
actually allows for different uh well

02:11:35,920 --> 02:11:39,280
but it opens quite some other

02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:42,079
possibilities as in

02:11:39,280 --> 02:11:43,199
yeah well you can migrate data between

02:11:42,079 --> 02:11:45,360
your computers

02:11:43,199 --> 02:11:46,800
without actually transferring files

02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:49,840
yourself you can

02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:52,000
automate the synchronization

02:11:49,840 --> 02:11:53,040
there's quite some things to explore

02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:56,719
over here

02:11:53,040 --> 02:11:59,920
it's all all of this is

02:11:56,719 --> 02:12:03,290
very very early stages but yeah

02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:04,480
it's got quite some potential

02:12:03,290 --> 02:12:07,840
[Music]

02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:11,040
and yeah this is about it

02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:15,760
uh you can find us at the

02:12:11,040 --> 02:12:18,800
tracker irc channel at can at ircnum.org

02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:20,639
or you can there's a tracker topic also

02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:24,400
at this course at this point

02:12:20,639 --> 02:12:27,440
i cannot see this course so you can

02:12:24,400 --> 02:12:34,159
feel free to join and chat and ask

02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:37,599
things and i said this

02:12:34,159 --> 02:12:42,480
this is something that could be

02:12:37,599 --> 02:12:46,800
nice i mean it scales nicely from

02:12:42,480 --> 02:12:49,920
private applications to to services

02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:53,040
that need complex ways to to export

02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:53,599
and exchange data it's got quite some

02:12:53,040 --> 02:12:56,719
different

02:12:53,599 --> 02:13:02,079
levels of usefulness so

02:12:56,719 --> 02:13:04,159
i hope you found it useful

02:13:02,079 --> 02:13:05,679
thank you very much carlos for your

02:13:04,159 --> 02:13:08,800
presentation

02:13:05,679 --> 02:13:11,840
uh we have a few questions for you

02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:13,679
uh those are the shared notes yeah let's

02:13:11,840 --> 02:13:16,800
go through them

02:13:13,679 --> 02:13:20,960
the first one why would i choose tracker

02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:24,400
over other spark ul implementations

02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:27,599
yeah that's well

02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:30,480
one would be speed i mean as i said

02:13:27,599 --> 02:13:30,960
we are implemented on top of sqlite and

02:13:30,480 --> 02:13:34,000
we

02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:37,040
are we've been

02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:40,800
traditionally very focused on speed

02:13:37,040 --> 02:13:44,159
and and being lean and whatnot so

02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:46,719
yeah i'd say that actually the the

02:13:44,159 --> 02:13:47,679
most similar implementation that would

02:13:46,719 --> 02:13:50,880
be around

02:13:47,679 --> 02:13:54,880
it would be rbf lead because that's

02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:57,119
a a library

02:13:54,880 --> 02:13:59,920
so applications can use sparkful and

02:13:57,119 --> 02:14:04,960
query easy in a similar way but

02:13:59,920 --> 02:14:06,639
yeah it's i i wouldn't say that the

02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:08,400
there's that many sparkle

02:14:06,639 --> 02:14:09,119
implementations that are desktop

02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:12,800
friendly

02:14:09,119 --> 02:14:16,320
most of them are gigantic databases and

02:14:12,800 --> 02:14:20,560
complex engines and they are not

02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:20,560
something that an application can pull

02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:25,199
yeah the next one could be could i

02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:28,719
develop

02:14:25,199 --> 02:14:32,400
kde software that makes use of tracker

02:14:28,719 --> 02:14:35,760
there used to be a acute rubber

02:14:32,400 --> 02:14:37,840
for it it was from the nokia times it's

02:14:35,760 --> 02:14:40,320
i don't even know where you can find it

02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:43,760
right now but it is possible

02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:48,079
it's you can i mean

02:14:43,760 --> 02:14:52,079
it uses you leave and the main loop but

02:14:48,079 --> 02:14:57,440
it can be reasonably hidden

02:14:52,079 --> 02:14:57,440
on top of our rocket or something

02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:03,440
the next question what resources are

02:15:01,599 --> 02:15:05,119
available to learn

02:15:03,440 --> 02:15:06,880
how to make the most from darker and

02:15:05,119 --> 02:15:10,000
sparkle

02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:13,199
yeah that's a good question we are

02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:15,199
uh the the main focus i'd say right now

02:15:13,199 --> 02:15:16,560
is actually trying to improve the

02:15:15,199 --> 02:15:22,719
developer experience

02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:22,719
we have uh quite some documentation but

02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:28,560
yeah some of it is work in progress we

02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:32,159
have a tutorial

02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:36,000
which is work in progress that's sad but

02:15:32,159 --> 02:15:39,040
yeah outside of tracker

02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:42,960
there's plenty of resources uh

02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:45,440
but yeah well uh i wouldn't

02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:46,079
know which one to recommend specifically

02:15:45,440 --> 02:15:49,840
because

02:15:46,079 --> 02:15:53,599
uh yeah they tend to be either to

02:15:49,840 --> 02:15:57,120
technically getting into into algebra

02:15:53,599 --> 02:15:58,960
and jargon or to too basic so

02:15:57,120 --> 02:16:02,560
[Music]

02:15:58,960 --> 02:16:02,560
so yeah it's but

02:16:02,880 --> 02:16:08,079
yeah yeah that that's something that

02:16:06,719 --> 02:16:10,719
that is something that would be nice to

02:16:08,079 --> 02:16:14,000
improve and help us work on

02:16:10,719 --> 02:16:14,639
so if you can learn on the way and help

02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:18,880
us with that

02:16:14,639 --> 02:16:21,920
that would be great

02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:23,119
and next one is there any successful

02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:26,079
stories over using

02:16:23,119 --> 02:16:27,760
such databases what they seem very

02:16:26,079 --> 02:16:29,840
powerful

02:16:27,760 --> 02:16:32,399
it's used in this since we need it i

02:16:29,840 --> 02:16:35,760
think instagram desktop usage

02:16:32,399 --> 02:16:38,319
i think most of the limitations

02:16:35,760 --> 02:16:39,280
are because precisely because there

02:16:38,319 --> 02:16:41,519
hasn't been

02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:41,519
any

02:16:42,479 --> 02:16:47,120
any worthwhile implementations or the

02:16:45,120 --> 02:16:49,840
belief

02:16:47,120 --> 02:16:51,200
is python only as far as i know so yeah

02:16:49,840 --> 02:16:55,679
it's

02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:57,840
that there hasn't been has that

02:16:55,679 --> 02:17:00,719
many implementations that you can use

02:16:57,840 --> 02:17:04,160
without pulling a huge database

02:17:00,719 --> 02:17:08,399
engine basically

02:17:04,160 --> 02:17:11,920
so yeah this this tracker

02:17:08,399 --> 02:17:12,399
history has also come a long way i mean

02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:16,240
the

02:17:12,399 --> 02:17:20,399
sparkwell 1.1 support is new in tracker

02:17:16,240 --> 02:17:23,519
3.0 which is uh

02:17:20,399 --> 02:17:24,319
one year and a half ago or something

02:17:23,519 --> 02:17:27,519
like that

02:17:24,319 --> 02:17:30,639
so it's not like it has

02:17:27,519 --> 02:17:33,679
it's been developing to do

02:17:30,639 --> 02:17:33,679
what it is right now

02:17:35,599 --> 02:17:42,639
and i think that's it well

02:17:39,599 --> 02:17:56,399
if we have five minutes left i think

02:17:42,639 --> 02:17:58,399
yes if there's any more percentage oh

02:17:56,399 --> 02:18:01,120
yeah and i actually didn't answer the

02:17:58,399 --> 02:18:04,160
about the successful stories i mean

02:18:01,120 --> 02:18:04,160
uh that there's

02:18:04,319 --> 02:18:07,920
there's quite some stuff you can know

02:18:06,080 --> 02:18:11,359
that you can look at

02:18:07,920 --> 02:18:16,240
i say it's been ported

02:18:11,359 --> 02:18:17,200
already everything to tracker 3 and it

02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:21,920
uses this

02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:24,719
approach to using tracker so

02:18:21,920 --> 02:18:26,319
so it's everything is already there and

02:18:24,719 --> 02:18:26,870
working and

02:18:26,319 --> 02:18:30,069
works

02:18:26,870 --> 02:18:30,069
[Music]

02:23:15,280 --> 02:23:19,200

making dollars and cents of free

02:24:01,760 --> 02:24:04,880
software funding's future

02:24:04,960 --> 02:24:12,840
um do i best control this

02:24:08,319 --> 02:24:16,160

and i'm here because i believe in a

02:24:30,160 --> 02:24:37,439
big and little left free society

02:24:34,240 --> 02:24:39,359
people planet future world culture

02:24:37,439 --> 02:24:40,720
um it's kind of one of the things that's

02:24:39,359 --> 02:24:43,840
been driving

02:24:40,720 --> 02:24:46,240
my interest for a long time

02:24:43,840 --> 02:24:46,960
and you can find me at alt salt pretty

02:24:46,240 --> 02:24:50,160
much everywhere

02:24:46,960 --> 02:24:53,439
dotnet in different places i've been

02:24:50,160 --> 02:24:55,520
using linux since 1996 and speaking

02:24:53,439 --> 02:24:59,200
and organizing groups and conferences

02:24:55,520 --> 02:25:02,640
and whatnot since about 2005.

02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:06,240
but recently i've been spending my time

02:25:02,640 --> 02:25:10,399
kind of in a few core areas

02:25:06,240 --> 02:25:11,520
so the first one is academia i recently

02:25:10,399 --> 02:25:14,800
got my

02:25:11,520 --> 02:25:16,640
master's thesis submitted and defended

02:25:14,800 --> 02:25:18,960
just over a month ago and i've been

02:25:16,640 --> 02:25:21,520
spending a lot of

02:25:18,960 --> 02:25:22,640
energy and time doing that for the last

02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:24,640
four years

02:25:22,640 --> 02:25:26,080
right now i'm in a phd program to

02:25:24,640 --> 02:25:29,359
continue with that

02:25:26,080 --> 02:25:31,200
uh thank you very much and um my focus

02:25:29,359 --> 02:25:34,080
has really been on

02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:34,880
tech policy and then peer production

02:25:34,080 --> 02:25:37,520
communities

02:25:34,880 --> 02:25:38,240
uh policies what not around off that

02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:41,040
area

02:25:38,240 --> 02:25:42,080
so kind of our space my second area has

02:25:41,040 --> 02:25:44,560
been events

02:25:42,080 --> 02:25:46,000
and uh specifically for the last eight

02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:48,080
years i've been involved with seagull

02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:49,600
the seattle canoe linux conference

02:25:48,080 --> 02:25:52,960
you can see a little signal here a

02:25:49,600 --> 02:25:55,520
little seagull there seal everywhere

02:25:52,960 --> 02:25:56,720
our ninth event is uh ninth years coming

02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:59,520
up and we have

02:25:56,720 --> 02:26:00,240
announced that we're going to be virtual

02:25:59,520 --> 02:26:02,399
so

02:26:00,240 --> 02:26:03,760
please check us out cfp will be out

02:26:02,399 --> 02:26:06,240
sometime next month

02:26:03,760 --> 02:26:06,960
that'll be november 5th and 6th the last

02:26:06,240 --> 02:26:10,399
one is

02:26:06,960 --> 02:26:12,080
crowd matching so this is uh

02:26:10,399 --> 02:26:14,160
kind of an area i've been involved in

02:26:12,080 --> 02:26:15,680
for over five years now

02:26:14,160 --> 02:26:17,680
and part of what i'm going to be

02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:19,520
discussing today so i'm

02:26:17,680 --> 02:26:21,120
technically the community director of

02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:24,479
snowdrift co-op

02:26:21,120 --> 02:26:26,720
and um we've been a osi

02:26:24,479 --> 02:26:27,920
incubator project now and we're about to

02:26:26,720 --> 02:26:30,800
graduate

02:26:27,920 --> 02:26:32,240
and uh move on to actually being

02:26:30,800 --> 02:26:35,520
launched and

02:26:32,240 --> 02:26:37,600
making some of this uh stuff a reality

02:26:35,520 --> 02:26:39,439
that said we're also waiting from the to

02:26:37,600 --> 02:26:40,560
hear back from the fsf high priorities

02:26:39,439 --> 02:26:42,319
project committee

02:26:40,560 --> 02:26:43,840
and um we've applied and we actually

02:26:42,319 --> 02:26:45,120
wrote out i think quite a good thing so

02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:45,840
if you have some time to read that blog

02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:49,200
post

02:26:45,840 --> 02:26:51,840
i'd recommend it that's me

02:26:49,200 --> 02:26:53,760
what are we what are we here for what is

02:26:51,840 --> 02:26:58,319
what is today

02:26:53,760 --> 02:27:02,080
so looking at the really high level

02:26:58,319 --> 02:27:04,160
uh i'm going to talk to you about a

02:27:02,080 --> 02:27:06,800
wicked problem

02:27:04,160 --> 02:27:07,840
and the wicked problem is that

02:27:06,800 --> 02:27:11,120
everything

02:27:07,840 --> 02:27:12,720
comes down to coordination it's

02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:14,399
kind of the defining characteristic of

02:27:12,720 --> 02:27:16,880
homo sapiens

02:27:14,399 --> 02:27:19,120
this ability to coordinate to have a

02:27:16,880 --> 02:27:22,240
shared systems of understanding

02:27:19,120 --> 02:27:24,399
they enable us to have a society they

02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:28,000
let us build these amazing things

02:27:24,399 --> 02:27:31,040
but sometimes these things are harmful

02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:34,160
sometimes they're great

02:27:31,040 --> 02:27:36,800
currently knowledge commons exists

02:27:34,160 --> 02:27:39,920
in this attention economy and that

02:27:36,800 --> 02:27:42,880
introduces surveillance and advertising

02:27:39,920 --> 02:27:44,399
which is a whole bunch of um not so nice

02:27:42,880 --> 02:27:47,520
things

02:27:44,399 --> 02:27:49,280
but what alternatives do we have

02:27:47,520 --> 02:27:50,960
and what would a world look like if we

02:27:49,280 --> 02:27:55,520
were just

02:27:50,960 --> 02:27:55,520
free to create well

02:27:55,840 --> 02:28:01,120
what we're going to be talking about

02:27:57,120 --> 02:28:01,120
here over the next

02:28:03,120 --> 02:28:08,000
30 minutes or so is we're going to go

02:28:06,640 --> 02:28:09,600
through the definitions

02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:11,439
so that we're kind of on the same page

02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:15,600
about things let me give you a

02:28:11,439 --> 02:28:18,319
brief history of public goods funding

02:28:15,600 --> 02:28:20,399
talk about kind of the current state of

02:28:18,319 --> 02:28:22,720
funding how it's

02:28:20,399 --> 02:28:24,399
you know how we are funding this stuff

02:28:22,720 --> 02:28:26,560
and then some of the solutions that are

02:28:24,399 --> 02:28:29,439
actively being worked on so these are

02:28:26,560 --> 02:28:29,439
the um

02:28:29,920 --> 02:28:33,760
one thing is our project but there are

02:28:32,560 --> 02:28:35,840
others

02:28:33,760 --> 02:28:37,439
and then the future as i see it the

02:28:35,840 --> 02:28:40,640
future that

02:28:37,439 --> 02:28:44,160
kind of hoping to build

02:28:40,640 --> 02:28:49,200
with uh the fall of you so

02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:52,640
starting with the definitions

02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:53,439
now there's a lot of terms that we could

02:28:52,640 --> 02:28:55,840
go over

02:28:53,439 --> 02:28:57,920
i'm gonna not try to belabor some of

02:28:55,840 --> 02:28:59,520
them um

02:28:57,920 --> 02:29:01,520
if you want to go deeper i'm happy to

02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:04,319
have those conversations elsewhere

02:29:01,520 --> 02:29:05,520
but there are there are a few that are

02:29:04,319 --> 02:29:08,880
kind of valuable for

02:29:05,520 --> 02:29:10,399
uh moving the conversation forward so

02:29:08,880 --> 02:29:12,160
the ones that i want you to keep in mind

02:29:10,399 --> 02:29:13,760
as i go through these are the public

02:29:12,160 --> 02:29:16,800
goods

02:29:13,760 --> 02:29:18,160
the commons free libre open source

02:29:16,800 --> 02:29:23,760
software

02:29:18,160 --> 02:29:27,280
tragedy of the commons and free writing

02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:31,840
make sure that i do not disturb

02:29:27,280 --> 02:29:31,840
my computers up okay so

02:29:32,560 --> 02:29:38,160
let's start with what are the publicans

02:29:35,920 --> 02:29:41,760
what is what is the commons

02:29:38,160 --> 02:29:43,920
now public goods as a term is a concept

02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:46,399
from economics

02:29:43,920 --> 02:29:47,920
it was attributed to paul samuelson in

02:29:46,399 --> 02:29:50,240
02:29:47,920 --> 02:29:51,920
and then expanded by richard musgrave

02:29:50,240 --> 02:29:56,240
and garrett hardin

02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:57,439
in the 60s its current form as we

02:29:56,240 --> 02:30:00,319
understand it

02:29:57,439 --> 02:30:02,000
was kind of put forth by eleanor ostrom

02:30:00,319 --> 02:30:05,520
in 1990.

02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:08,880
now what you see on the screen here is

02:30:05,520 --> 02:30:11,439
the ostrom 2x2 matrix it's displaying

02:30:08,880 --> 02:30:12,880
four types of goods and they're

02:30:11,439 --> 02:30:16,160
differentiated by these

02:30:12,880 --> 02:30:16,160
kind of two

02:30:17,200 --> 02:30:24,080
characteristics so the first one

02:30:20,800 --> 02:30:27,840
is rivalry this is whether something's

02:30:24,080 --> 02:30:30,080
usefulness is diminished through usage

02:30:27,840 --> 02:30:31,359
and the second one is excludability

02:30:30,080 --> 02:30:33,520
that's whether

02:30:31,359 --> 02:30:36,160
the use can be restricted can you

02:30:33,520 --> 02:30:39,120
exclude people from it

02:30:36,160 --> 02:30:40,080
now examples of each for each of these

02:30:39,120 --> 02:30:42,560
four

02:30:40,080 --> 02:30:43,280
the one i like to say for private good

02:30:42,560 --> 02:30:45,760
is

02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:47,120
like a piece of clothing like a hat if

02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:50,640
i'm wearing the hat

02:30:47,120 --> 02:30:53,439
you can't also be wearing that same hat

02:30:50,640 --> 02:30:54,800
a club good is again somewhere where you

02:30:53,439 --> 02:30:57,600
put a wall around it

02:30:54,800 --> 02:30:58,800
so usually you might think of an

02:30:57,600 --> 02:31:01,200
amusement park

02:30:58,800 --> 02:31:01,200
right

02:31:02,479 --> 02:31:09,600
i mean private club club good

02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:12,640
then there's common pool resources now

02:31:09,600 --> 02:31:15,439
common pool resources

02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:15,840
are these these areas where there there

02:31:15,439 --> 02:31:18,720
are

02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:20,800
there is rivalrousness there's a limited

02:31:18,720 --> 02:31:22,560
amount of resources

02:31:20,800 --> 02:31:24,319
but it's not excluded it's not

02:31:22,560 --> 02:31:27,600
excludable it's it's uh

02:31:24,319 --> 02:31:28,160
commonly accessible so an idea here

02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:31,359
might be an

02:31:28,160 --> 02:31:32,240
ocean full of fish now ocean full of

02:31:31,359 --> 02:31:36,720
fish

02:31:32,240 --> 02:31:36,720
uh everyone has the fish but

02:31:36,960 --> 02:31:40,560
you can imagine that there are a limited

02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:44,000
number of fish

02:31:40,560 --> 02:31:47,520
and so it is a

02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:49,200
common pool of resource the last one and

02:31:47,520 --> 02:31:49,920
the one we're going to talk about a lot

02:31:49,200 --> 02:31:54,240
here

02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:56,960
are public goods now public globes

02:31:54,240 --> 02:31:57,920
can be thought of as as things that

02:31:56,960 --> 02:32:00,240
everyone can share

02:31:57,920 --> 02:32:01,920
and uh sharing is not diminishing it for

02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:05,840
anyone else

02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:09,040
uh the one that i like to talk about but

02:32:05,840 --> 02:32:10,560
um it's only my hope that will it will

02:32:09,040 --> 02:32:13,120
continue to be a public good

02:32:10,560 --> 02:32:13,920
is clean air right this idea of like i'm

02:32:13,120 --> 02:32:16,960
breathing air

02:32:13,920 --> 02:32:20,080
you're breathing air that's not

02:32:16,960 --> 02:32:23,120
in in a broad sense diminishing

02:32:20,080 --> 02:32:23,120
the air quality

02:32:23,359 --> 02:32:30,479
all right so that framing of

02:32:28,080 --> 02:32:31,680
economic terms kind of gets us to what

02:32:30,479 --> 02:32:33,280
the public goods are

02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:36,479
explains a little bit about the commons

02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:38,880
we'll come back to that shortly

02:32:36,479 --> 02:32:39,840
the next big area i know this is going

02:32:38,880 --> 02:32:42,560
to be

02:32:39,840 --> 02:32:44,240
common to most of you but is free libre

02:32:42,560 --> 02:32:47,520
open source software

02:32:44,240 --> 02:32:50,240
now in the 1980s uh

02:32:47,520 --> 02:32:52,080
richard stallman rms came up with this

02:32:50,240 --> 02:32:55,520
idea to turn copyright

02:32:52,080 --> 02:32:58,000
back on itself and what we commonly

02:32:55,520 --> 02:33:01,200
refer to is copy left

02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:04,000
and the idea behind that is

02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:06,560
to really turn things that are otherwise

02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:10,080
being licensed and restricted

02:33:06,560 --> 02:33:11,920
into public goods now

02:33:10,080 --> 02:33:13,680
it's been extended outside the scope of

02:33:11,920 --> 02:33:16,800
software things like

02:33:13,680 --> 02:33:20,479
creative commons and

02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:24,000
it's also been misappropriated right

02:33:20,479 --> 02:33:26,880
it's open source watch washing

02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:28,319
and despite the arguments over the years

02:33:26,880 --> 02:33:30,479
i just go with flow

02:33:28,319 --> 02:33:31,920
right i'm going to go with the flow free

02:33:30,479 --> 02:33:34,720
library open i actually think

02:33:31,920 --> 02:33:35,600
each one brings something different and

02:33:34,720 --> 02:33:39,439
valuable

02:33:35,600 --> 02:33:41,760
to the conversation but

02:33:39,439 --> 02:33:43,359
just to be clear we are talking about

02:33:41,760 --> 02:33:47,520
the free software movement

02:33:43,359 --> 02:33:52,000
and specifically when things are flow

02:33:47,520 --> 02:33:54,720
licensed they become public goods

02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:56,479
again uh not to get into the the

02:33:54,720 --> 02:34:00,399
difference between the

02:33:56,479 --> 02:34:01,840
uh terms all that much here but um

02:34:00,399 --> 02:34:03,520
that is actually part of what my thesis

02:34:01,840 --> 02:34:04,240
is about and breaking down this idea

02:34:03,520 --> 02:34:07,120
promises

02:34:04,240 --> 02:34:08,399
permissive and protective because uh the

02:34:07,120 --> 02:34:10,880
copyleft stuff

02:34:08,399 --> 02:34:12,319
keeps things public goods whereas the

02:34:10,880 --> 02:34:15,120
permissive licenses

02:34:12,319 --> 02:34:17,280
only make the initial instance a

02:34:15,120 --> 02:34:20,319
publicate

02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:23,840
but there's two kind of related

02:34:20,319 --> 02:34:25,439
uh like deeply related uh items when we

02:34:23,840 --> 02:34:27,920
talk about

02:34:25,439 --> 02:34:29,359
free uh free library opens for software

02:34:27,920 --> 02:34:32,640
floss

02:34:29,359 --> 02:34:35,120
and i guess public goods in general

02:34:32,640 --> 02:34:36,479
but but um public goods and the commons

02:34:35,120 --> 02:34:38,319
in general

02:34:36,479 --> 02:34:39,680
so the first one is called the tragedy

02:34:38,319 --> 02:34:42,399
of the commons

02:34:39,680 --> 02:34:43,120
and this is actually related to that

02:34:42,399 --> 02:34:45,359
older term

02:34:43,120 --> 02:34:47,840
i can't mention we'd go back to it of

02:34:45,359 --> 02:34:51,439
the commons um

02:34:47,840 --> 02:34:54,479
this talk i gave uh earlier this year

02:34:51,439 --> 02:34:58,080
at libre planet and

02:34:54,479 --> 02:34:59,439
uh as a little retired it was just

02:34:58,080 --> 02:35:01,280
going through things and someone

02:34:59,439 --> 02:35:03,439
actually pointed out that i kind of

02:35:01,280 --> 02:35:04,720
conflated the history of the commons and

02:35:03,439 --> 02:35:07,680
the public goods and all that so i'm

02:35:04,720 --> 02:35:11,040
trying to make that a little more clear

02:35:07,680 --> 02:35:12,160
the history of the commons extends back

02:35:11,040 --> 02:35:16,080
to at least

02:35:12,160 --> 02:35:19,439
the 1550s um in great britain

02:35:16,080 --> 02:35:21,439
likely before then but the tragedy of

02:35:19,439 --> 02:35:26,479
the commons was first written about

02:35:21,439 --> 02:35:28,800
by william forster lloyd in 1833

02:35:26,479 --> 02:35:30,560
and brought into modern detention as

02:35:28,800 --> 02:35:33,600
well as actually being named

02:35:30,560 --> 02:35:36,880
tragedy of the commons by garrett hardin

02:35:33,600 --> 02:35:40,319
in 1968.

02:35:36,880 --> 02:35:41,680
the idea behind this is commons will

02:35:40,319 --> 02:35:44,880
collapse

02:35:41,680 --> 02:35:47,520
if they're overused right

02:35:44,880 --> 02:35:48,800
and not only that that a lot of game

02:35:47,520 --> 02:35:51,200
theory basically shows

02:35:48,800 --> 02:35:52,080
it's in everyone's uh maybe not best

02:35:51,200 --> 02:35:54,880
interest but

02:35:52,080 --> 02:35:56,640
it's it's natural to overuse these

02:35:54,880 --> 02:35:59,280
resources

02:35:56,640 --> 02:36:00,479
now ostrom demonstrated that it's

02:35:59,280 --> 02:36:04,479
avoidable

02:36:00,479 --> 02:36:04,479
through proper governance actually

02:36:05,680 --> 02:36:11,680
yeah how quickly can i can i pull out uh

02:36:08,720 --> 02:36:13,920
the awesome book governing the commons

02:36:11,680 --> 02:36:13,920
so

02:36:14,800 --> 02:36:18,800
that's the tragedy of the commons and we

02:36:16,880 --> 02:36:20,479
we have know about it

02:36:18,800 --> 02:36:22,080
um and we'll get back to why we're

02:36:20,479 --> 02:36:25,520
defining these terms

02:36:22,080 --> 02:36:26,960
fairly shortly the other big problem

02:36:25,520 --> 02:36:30,880
that's often discussed

02:36:26,960 --> 02:36:33,359
is the free writer problem now

02:36:30,880 --> 02:36:36,640
what this is is that through the

02:36:33,359 --> 02:36:40,720
widespread use of public goods

02:36:36,640 --> 02:36:40,720
without providing support back

02:36:41,280 --> 02:36:46,640
we get degradation we have uh

02:36:44,880 --> 02:36:49,359
excess pressure on those people who do

02:36:46,640 --> 02:36:52,240
support the public goods right if

02:36:49,359 --> 02:36:52,240
if um

02:36:55,359 --> 02:36:59,600
everyone rides the bus for free who pays

02:36:58,720 --> 02:37:03,520
for the maintenance

02:36:59,600 --> 02:37:06,880
right and of course buses aren't

02:37:03,520 --> 02:37:12,720
maybe always the best but

02:37:06,880 --> 02:37:14,960
example but transit as a broader system

02:37:12,720 --> 02:37:14,960
now

02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:21,840
this talk is mostly going to focus

02:37:19,280 --> 02:37:23,760
on public goods and the free rider

02:37:21,840 --> 02:37:26,800
problem

02:37:23,760 --> 02:37:30,000
and when i think of public goods

02:37:26,800 --> 02:37:33,200
what i really think of is

02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:36,240
public information goods that's because

02:37:33,200 --> 02:37:37,680
it uh you know as i've come up uh up a

02:37:36,240 --> 02:37:39,280
few times here

02:37:37,680 --> 02:37:41,439
thinking about what a public good is can

02:37:39,280 --> 02:37:43,040
be tricky uh when you're talking about

02:37:41,439 --> 02:37:46,240
tangible things

02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:47,760
um you know it's they often talk about

02:37:46,240 --> 02:37:51,439
national security

02:37:47,760 --> 02:37:51,439
or the radio wave spectrum

02:37:51,600 --> 02:37:54,800
it takes a lot of work to get that

02:37:53,120 --> 02:37:57,600
abstract concept

02:37:54,800 --> 02:37:58,560
but if you think of it as information

02:37:57,600 --> 02:38:01,520
information

02:37:58,560 --> 02:38:01,920
can be shared without it costing barely

02:38:01,520 --> 02:38:04,560
anything

02:38:01,920 --> 02:38:06,240
it does cost some time some electricity

02:38:04,560 --> 02:38:07,520
there are things like that but the costs

02:38:06,240 --> 02:38:09,439
start going away

02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:10,800
they become minimal and by having the

02:38:09,439 --> 02:38:12,240
cost go away

02:38:10,800 --> 02:38:14,160
it can it can be a lot easier to

02:38:12,240 --> 02:38:15,439
conceptualize these things as true

02:38:14,160 --> 02:38:17,840
publicates

02:38:15,439 --> 02:38:20,319
as long as they're staying not

02:38:17,840 --> 02:38:22,319
excludable

02:38:20,319 --> 02:38:23,840
now what i think of when i think

02:38:22,319 --> 02:38:27,200
information goods

02:38:23,840 --> 02:38:31,120
i think of software as we've discussed

02:38:27,200 --> 02:38:33,760
i think of research think of journalism

02:38:31,120 --> 02:38:37,280
and to some extent i think of art though

02:38:33,760 --> 02:38:37,280
not all forms of art but many

02:38:37,520 --> 02:38:40,560
so now we have the definition

02:38:39,439 --> 02:38:42,160
definitions down

02:38:40,560 --> 02:38:43,600
i want to start talking about the

02:38:42,160 --> 02:38:45,920
history

02:38:43,600 --> 02:38:47,920
and this is uh so that we can kind of

02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:49,680
discuss the context

02:38:47,920 --> 02:38:51,600
with which this conversation is taking

02:38:49,680 --> 02:38:54,560
place

02:38:51,600 --> 02:38:55,280
and i'm going to be approaching this

02:38:54,560 --> 02:38:57,439
from

02:38:55,280 --> 02:38:59,359
discussion of journalism funding

02:38:57,439 --> 02:39:01,920
journalism

02:38:59,359 --> 02:39:02,880
which is going through patronage to the

02:39:01,920 --> 02:39:04,880
people

02:39:02,880 --> 02:39:06,720
to some extent back to patronage before

02:39:04,880 --> 02:39:07,840
we talk about that model in terms of

02:39:06,720 --> 02:39:11,840
software

02:39:07,840 --> 02:39:11,840
and a broader software ecosystem

02:39:13,120 --> 02:39:17,200
so journalism

02:39:17,280 --> 02:39:22,000
sorry about that moving through my

02:39:19,439 --> 02:39:25,760
slides a little more quickly

02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:28,080
journalism was initially funded by

02:39:25,760 --> 02:39:30,640
those who could afford printing presses

02:39:28,080 --> 02:39:33,600
these these things are

02:39:30,640 --> 02:39:34,880
by no means cheap uh there were a few of

02:39:33,600 --> 02:39:37,520
them

02:39:34,880 --> 02:39:38,880
and if you wanted to print something you

02:39:37,520 --> 02:39:40,240
had to go to the person with the

02:39:38,880 --> 02:39:43,200
printing press

02:39:40,240 --> 02:39:44,800
they made those decisions yes there are

02:39:43,200 --> 02:39:47,840
legal frameworks that were

02:39:44,800 --> 02:39:49,840
brought up to even restrict it more

02:39:47,840 --> 02:39:51,600
but when it came down to it that's what

02:39:49,840 --> 02:39:53,840
happened

02:39:51,600 --> 02:39:55,840
but as time went on the brain presses

02:39:53,840 --> 02:39:59,120
became more affordable

02:39:55,840 --> 02:40:02,800
um became more democratized

02:39:59,120 --> 02:40:03,600
some might say and the the funding

02:40:02,800 --> 02:40:06,080
structure

02:40:03,600 --> 02:40:07,120
behind journalism switched to really

02:40:06,080 --> 02:40:12,080
relying

02:40:07,120 --> 02:40:15,120
on classifieds and like advertisements

02:40:12,080 --> 02:40:17,120
uh rolling back a little bit i'm talking

02:40:15,120 --> 02:40:20,880
mostly about journalism in the context

02:40:17,120 --> 02:40:23,600
of the united states as i'll touch on

02:40:20,880 --> 02:40:23,600
momentarily

02:40:23,840 --> 02:40:27,279
as the classified ads became free online

02:40:26,880 --> 02:40:31,120
right

02:40:27,279 --> 02:40:32,880
as we had uh craigslist and other things

02:40:31,120 --> 02:40:34,319
the power was really placed more and

02:40:32,880 --> 02:40:37,760
more and more with just

02:40:34,319 --> 02:40:38,880
advertisers to the point where they

02:40:37,760 --> 02:40:41,439
drive

02:40:38,880 --> 02:40:43,439
the message this gets back to the idea

02:40:41,439 --> 02:40:46,240
of the attention economy

02:40:43,439 --> 02:40:46,240
the idea that

02:40:47,600 --> 02:40:53,439
if you want money if you want to pay

02:40:50,880 --> 02:40:55,200
your journalists you have to run things

02:40:53,439 --> 02:40:56,880
that the advertisers

02:40:55,200 --> 02:40:58,240
will give you money for so that means

02:40:56,880 --> 02:40:59,120
that you're running things that are more

02:40:58,240 --> 02:41:01,760
shocking

02:40:59,120 --> 02:41:02,800
things that are maybe not as as useful

02:41:01,760 --> 02:41:06,720
in the traditional

02:41:02,800 --> 02:41:06,720
traditional journalistic form

02:41:06,880 --> 02:41:10,160
now some countries why i was speaking

02:41:09,040 --> 02:41:14,399
about the us here

02:41:10,160 --> 02:41:16,160
have actually a different model

02:41:14,399 --> 02:41:18,560
they they state sponsored their

02:41:16,160 --> 02:41:21,120
journalism they state sponsor their news

02:41:18,560 --> 02:41:22,800
now uh one that comes to my mind often

02:41:21,120 --> 02:41:26,319
is friends

02:41:22,800 --> 02:41:29,279
and this type of

02:41:26,319 --> 02:41:30,240
sponsorship this type of funding has

02:41:29,279 --> 02:41:33,680
problems

02:41:30,240 --> 02:41:36,800
right uh there are things you can't say

02:41:33,680 --> 02:41:39,439
if you want to keep your funding

02:41:36,800 --> 02:41:40,160
but it does allow that news to be more

02:41:39,439 --> 02:41:42,240
focused

02:41:40,160 --> 02:41:44,399
on the civic issues on things of the

02:41:42,240 --> 02:41:48,319
public interest

02:41:44,399 --> 02:41:50,720
because the news isn't being directed it

02:41:48,319 --> 02:41:52,800
does have corners where they don't want

02:41:50,720 --> 02:41:55,120
you to maybe look

02:41:52,800 --> 02:41:56,720
but it and and not that you can't but

02:41:55,120 --> 02:41:57,439
like if you want to keep your funding

02:41:56,720 --> 02:41:59,200
and

02:41:57,439 --> 02:42:01,600
that type of thing but it's not being

02:41:59,200 --> 02:42:04,080
directed in that same sense

02:42:01,600 --> 02:42:04,800
and so if we think about that model

02:42:04,080 --> 02:42:07,279
where it was like

02:42:04,800 --> 02:42:08,640
very directed and then kind of went to

02:42:07,279 --> 02:42:11,120
the people

02:42:08,640 --> 02:42:12,800
and has now moved back to being directed

02:42:11,120 --> 02:42:15,920
versus

02:42:12,800 --> 02:42:17,680
it was very directed and

02:42:15,920 --> 02:42:19,520
instead of moving kind of to the people

02:42:17,680 --> 02:42:21,680
it moved to what we may think of

02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:23,120
as a larger sense of people the

02:42:21,680 --> 02:42:25,600
government

02:42:23,120 --> 02:42:27,840
and so it doesn't have that direction

02:42:25,600 --> 02:42:27,840
but

02:42:28,720 --> 02:42:36,080
but it also is

02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:39,439
being funded by this large entity still

02:42:36,080 --> 02:42:40,399
so that arc i see it in other public

02:42:39,439 --> 02:42:42,640
goods

02:42:40,399 --> 02:42:45,120
and specifically part of why we're here

02:42:42,640 --> 02:42:48,720
is i see it in software

02:42:45,120 --> 02:42:50,479
initially software and before we

02:42:48,720 --> 02:42:52,399
even conceptualized it all that

02:42:50,479 --> 02:42:54,399
different is from hardware

02:42:52,399 --> 02:42:55,840
it was funded by universities right the

02:42:54,399 --> 02:42:57,040
idea that graduate students were working

02:42:55,840 --> 02:43:00,000
on these things

02:42:57,040 --> 02:43:00,800
in the military industrial complex but

02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,880
then it was

02:43:00,800 --> 02:43:03,840
freed to what you might think of like

02:43:02,880 --> 02:43:05,439
the public

02:43:03,840 --> 02:43:07,520
though of course most people didn't have

02:43:05,439 --> 02:43:09,920
access to computers or

02:43:07,520 --> 02:43:11,040
the available knowledge to interact with

02:43:09,920 --> 02:43:14,240
it

02:43:11,040 --> 02:43:15,359
but it was freed and these these public

02:43:14,240 --> 02:43:17,920
goods

02:43:15,359 --> 02:43:19,279
were you might say funded through

02:43:17,920 --> 02:43:21,840
development effort

02:43:19,279 --> 02:43:23,200
right there's still the energy and

02:43:21,840 --> 02:43:25,200
effort going into them

02:43:23,200 --> 02:43:27,680
but it's it's hobbyist we're able to

02:43:25,200 --> 02:43:33,120
interact with them

02:43:27,680 --> 02:43:35,680
now as of an ecosystem

02:43:33,120 --> 02:43:37,279
floss communities they have to keep the

02:43:35,680 --> 02:43:41,520
lights on

02:43:37,279 --> 02:43:44,319
have to eat pay rent have servers

02:43:41,520 --> 02:43:46,800
and so the developers ended up getting

02:43:44,319 --> 02:43:50,080
hired on by companies more and more

02:43:46,800 --> 02:43:51,040
and that means their efforts do become

02:43:50,080 --> 02:43:53,520
directed

02:43:51,040 --> 02:43:54,800
right they get directed away from flow

02:43:53,520 --> 02:43:59,200
projects

02:43:54,800 --> 02:44:00,960
because they have to sign clas caas

02:43:59,200 --> 02:44:02,560
they have to work on the majority of the

02:44:00,960 --> 02:44:05,279
time on this project versus the project

02:44:02,560 --> 02:44:08,720
they may want to work on

02:44:05,279 --> 02:44:11,439
this kind of brings me to this uh

02:44:08,720 --> 02:44:12,479
this term that one of my favorite old

02:44:11,439 --> 02:44:15,760
papers it's called

02:44:12,479 --> 02:44:17,120
cooking pot markets and it was described

02:44:15,760 --> 02:44:19,680
by

02:44:17,120 --> 02:44:20,319
sorry from butchery the name but rashad

02:44:19,680 --> 02:44:23,359
gauche

02:44:20,319 --> 02:44:26,399
in 1998 the idea is that

02:44:23,359 --> 02:44:30,319
the cooking pot is full of public goods

02:44:26,399 --> 02:44:31,920
and so when you add more of these goods

02:44:30,319 --> 02:44:34,560
because they're public goods everyone

02:44:31,920 --> 02:44:35,520
can take out without the pot diminishing

02:44:34,560 --> 02:44:38,560
so it just grows

02:44:35,520 --> 02:44:39,520
gets better and bigger and richer but

02:44:38,560 --> 02:44:41,680
what's stopping

02:44:39,520 --> 02:44:42,880
floss from growing like we we have

02:44:41,680 --> 02:44:45,279
absolutely grown we do

02:44:42,880 --> 02:44:47,439
see all of these areas where we have

02:44:45,279 --> 02:44:51,920
operating systems

02:44:47,439 --> 02:44:54,160
we have we have um bios we have

02:44:51,920 --> 02:44:56,960
these great graphics programs and there

02:44:54,160 --> 02:45:00,080
are some places we're absolutely

02:44:56,960 --> 02:45:04,319
doing well but in

02:45:00,080 --> 02:45:07,200
general right we're not growing

02:45:04,319 --> 02:45:09,920
to this true point of being able to be

02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:13,359
competitive at least in my opinion

02:45:09,920 --> 02:45:15,439
unfortunately i want that now

02:45:13,359 --> 02:45:16,800
what i think the reason is is that the

02:45:15,439 --> 02:45:20,080
ecosystem

02:45:16,800 --> 02:45:23,200
of software of free software is actually

02:45:20,080 --> 02:45:25,520
not public goods it's a commons

02:45:23,200 --> 02:45:27,439
and so we need to sustain that ecosystem

02:45:25,520 --> 02:45:29,840
as we would with the commons

02:45:27,439 --> 02:45:30,880
we need to sustain the developers not

02:45:29,840 --> 02:45:34,319
just

02:45:30,880 --> 02:45:35,520
keep putting in public good code

02:45:34,319 --> 02:45:38,000
if you if you don't sustain the

02:45:35,520 --> 02:45:40,640
developers you see these vulnerabilities

02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:41,120
right you see you see heart bleed the

02:45:40,640 --> 02:45:43,200
lack of

02:45:41,120 --> 02:45:45,520
uh the lack of the uh getting new

02:45:43,200 --> 02:45:48,560
developers get uh spending the time

02:45:45,520 --> 02:45:51,680
spending the money and

02:45:48,560 --> 02:45:54,720
and that path towards com competing like

02:45:51,680 --> 02:45:57,840
truly being competitive

02:45:54,720 --> 02:45:59,840
uh with primary software just i don't i

02:45:57,840 --> 02:46:02,800
don't think that

02:45:59,840 --> 02:46:04,399
it is going to happen unless we start

02:46:02,800 --> 02:46:07,600
worrying about

02:46:04,399 --> 02:46:10,880
um just being a commons

02:46:07,600 --> 02:46:14,080
developers are humans and in our current

02:46:10,880 --> 02:46:14,080
system humans need funding

02:46:14,399 --> 02:46:20,399
of course we do

02:46:17,840 --> 02:46:22,960
live in a society where there's funding

02:46:20,399 --> 02:46:25,120
it exists

02:46:22,960 --> 02:46:27,840
we're here right we're here at this this

02:46:25,120 --> 02:46:27,840
amazing event

02:46:29,040 --> 02:46:33,120
and part of that is that there are

02:46:31,439 --> 02:46:34,720
people already shoveling

02:46:33,120 --> 02:46:36,479
in the sense that we'll get to there are

02:46:34,720 --> 02:46:40,080
people who are already

02:46:36,479 --> 02:46:44,000
engaging giving of themselves right

02:46:40,080 --> 02:46:47,120
we've gotten here but

02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:49,279
really the funding comes from two kind

02:46:47,120 --> 02:46:52,319
of large spaces

02:46:49,279 --> 02:46:54,160
i should say three but for what

02:46:52,319 --> 02:46:56,160
what i would consider like good funding

02:46:54,160 --> 02:46:59,920
we have individual funding and we have

02:46:56,160 --> 02:47:02,800
institutional funding and then we have

02:46:59,920 --> 02:47:03,920
the thing i would like to avoid more and

02:47:02,800 --> 02:47:08,960
we'll get to

02:47:03,920 --> 02:47:08,960
which is manipulative funny well

02:47:09,520 --> 02:47:18,080
yes all right

02:47:12,960 --> 02:47:19,920
um questions

02:47:18,080 --> 02:47:21,200
i don't see the shared notes because

02:47:19,920 --> 02:47:24,080
that will take me

02:47:21,200 --> 02:47:24,720
out of uh out of the presentation mode

02:47:24,080 --> 02:47:27,840
but i will

02:47:24,720 --> 02:47:30,800
take a look at those after i'm done or

02:47:27,840 --> 02:47:34,479
if you drop them in the chat so let's

02:47:30,800 --> 02:47:36,240
talk about your individual funding

02:47:34,479 --> 02:47:38,319
the first one is through donations i

02:47:36,240 --> 02:47:40,000
mean this is the traditional

02:47:38,319 --> 02:47:41,600
funding source everyone has and thinks

02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:44,000
about you know

02:47:41,600 --> 02:47:46,160
can you please make a donation but these

02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:49,600
are often one time

02:47:46,160 --> 02:47:51,920
right and they're they're boundless

02:47:49,600 --> 02:47:54,880
you there's no floor there's no ceiling

02:47:51,920 --> 02:47:56,399
you can give as little or as much

02:47:54,880 --> 02:47:58,000
and that doesn't really connect with the

02:47:56,399 --> 02:48:00,880
project needs

02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:01,279
right the project needs thousand dollars

02:48:00,880 --> 02:48:05,040
to

02:48:01,279 --> 02:48:06,399
hire an ad like a ad agency to be able

02:48:05,040 --> 02:48:10,880
to produce something

02:48:06,399 --> 02:48:13,680
uh they they can't get it through like

02:48:10,880 --> 02:48:15,120
asking this is how much we need and

02:48:13,680 --> 02:48:17,279
there's not really this guarantee of

02:48:15,120 --> 02:48:19,760
impact there's there's nothing that says

02:48:17,279 --> 02:48:21,279
that if i give my five dollars that's

02:48:19,760 --> 02:48:22,720
going to sustain the project

02:48:21,279 --> 02:48:24,960
even if i give my five dollars a month

02:48:22,720 --> 02:48:28,800
it's not gonna sustain the project

02:48:24,960 --> 02:48:31,439
necessarily unless as we get to uh

02:48:28,800 --> 02:48:33,120
wealthy enough to really be getting a

02:48:31,439 --> 02:48:35,120
load

02:48:33,120 --> 02:48:37,520
their big space in individual funding is

02:48:35,120 --> 02:48:42,800
newer but it's become very popular

02:48:37,520 --> 02:48:42,800
and that's crowdfunding now crowdfunding

02:48:42,880 --> 02:48:48,479
is kind of in two camps

02:48:45,920 --> 02:48:49,359
we have the all or nothing one-time

02:48:48,479 --> 02:48:53,279
crowdfunds

02:48:49,359 --> 02:48:55,120
so this is kickstarter

02:48:53,279 --> 02:48:56,720
these are producing something everyone

02:48:55,120 --> 02:48:57,520
working towards a goal getting to the

02:48:56,720 --> 02:49:00,960
goal

02:48:57,520 --> 02:49:03,920
and making it happen it's great

02:49:00,960 --> 02:49:06,080
it's good it is going uh well we've seen

02:49:03,920 --> 02:49:09,520
a lot come out of this

02:49:06,080 --> 02:49:12,560
the other camp is these ongoing

02:49:09,520 --> 02:49:13,120
pledges but the ongoing pledges are made

02:49:12,560 --> 02:49:16,399
with

02:49:13,120 --> 02:49:19,760
a variety of levels that are made with

02:49:16,399 --> 02:49:24,080
i'm going to give more than you and

02:49:19,760 --> 02:49:24,080
so i get earlier access right

02:49:25,279 --> 02:49:29,200
i get the little extra trinket and so

02:49:28,319 --> 02:49:32,800
that's that's

02:49:29,200 --> 02:49:34,960
of course like the patreon model

02:49:32,800 --> 02:49:36,560
but both of these lose their

02:49:34,960 --> 02:49:37,200
effectiveness when it comes to public

02:49:36,560 --> 02:49:39,840
goods

02:49:37,200 --> 02:49:41,600
because you can't exclude people right

02:49:39,840 --> 02:49:43,920
and they're not rivalrous

02:49:41,600 --> 02:49:45,520
not rivalrous doesn't necessarily matter

02:49:43,920 --> 02:49:47,840
as much with these but

02:49:45,520 --> 02:49:50,000
the excludability definitely does

02:49:47,840 --> 02:49:51,680
because both of these you're giving

02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:54,160
at the different levels because you're

02:49:51,680 --> 02:49:56,000
getting something more than other people

02:49:54,160 --> 02:49:58,240
it's not based on because you have more

02:49:56,000 --> 02:50:01,760
necessarily

02:49:58,240 --> 02:50:08,479
now the other two in this individual's

02:50:01,760 --> 02:50:12,080
funding space

02:50:08,479 --> 02:50:16,960
i have my tux tee for my

02:50:12,080 --> 02:50:16,960
teagle txt mug um

02:50:17,120 --> 02:50:20,720
we have pledge drives now pledge drives

02:50:19,600 --> 02:50:23,680
are kind of

02:50:20,720 --> 02:50:24,479
crowd funding but they're older more

02:50:23,680 --> 02:50:27,680
traditional

02:50:24,479 --> 02:50:30,160
and they're really effective especially

02:50:27,680 --> 02:50:31,439
because they don't have those thresholds

02:50:30,160 --> 02:50:35,120
but they still are like

02:50:31,439 --> 02:50:36,479
kind of a time-bound thing

02:50:35,120 --> 02:50:38,960
but they require wide reaching

02:50:36,479 --> 02:50:40,240
communication right but

02:50:38,960 --> 02:50:42,880
i'm sure many of you have listened to

02:50:40,240 --> 02:50:44,319
npr and that annual pledge ride comes

02:50:42,880 --> 02:50:45,840
around

02:50:44,319 --> 02:50:47,520
you've been on wikipedia and you've seen

02:50:45,840 --> 02:50:50,640
the drives they need to hit

02:50:47,520 --> 02:50:53,920
a lot of people to to raise

02:50:50,640 --> 02:50:57,120
the amounts that they're looking for

02:50:53,920 --> 02:51:00,160
and they also are really

02:50:57,120 --> 02:51:04,160
maximized when there's this matching

02:51:00,160 --> 02:51:05,920
this idea that i you know someone's very

02:51:04,160 --> 02:51:06,479
wealthy and i'm gonna match however many

02:51:05,920 --> 02:51:08,560
people

02:51:06,479 --> 02:51:10,160
up to this point and so that really

02:51:08,560 --> 02:51:11,439
attracts people because they know that

02:51:10,160 --> 02:51:13,840
it's not just their money it's

02:51:11,439 --> 02:51:15,279
it's their money and others and so it

02:51:13,840 --> 02:51:16,800
grows faster and

02:51:15,279 --> 02:51:19,040
they're willing to make those little

02:51:16,800 --> 02:51:20,399
gives because again with that wide

02:51:19,040 --> 02:51:22,720
communication network

02:51:20,399 --> 02:51:23,600
they really can kind of have some

02:51:22,720 --> 02:51:26,640
assurance

02:51:23,600 --> 02:51:28,080
that they're making a difference

02:51:26,640 --> 02:51:29,760
the last one's a little different than

02:51:28,080 --> 02:51:31,840
all those other categories and this is

02:51:29,760 --> 02:51:32,960
bounties and commissions this is the

02:51:31,840 --> 02:51:36,160
idea that

02:51:32,960 --> 02:51:38,399
i'm only going to make progress if

02:51:36,160 --> 02:51:40,240
the price gets paid right which

02:51:38,399 --> 02:51:41,840
restricts creativity because

02:51:40,240 --> 02:51:43,760
now i can only work on the things that

02:51:41,840 --> 02:51:46,560
are being paid for

02:51:43,760 --> 02:51:48,000
and there's potential for sabotage as

02:51:46,560 --> 02:51:51,200
sad as it is

02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:53,279
um i can make

02:51:51,200 --> 02:51:54,399
things that people will want to pay for

02:51:53,279 --> 02:51:56,240
so that

02:51:54,399 --> 02:51:57,520
they will then pay the bounty and i'll

02:51:56,240 --> 02:51:59,920
work on them

02:51:57,520 --> 02:52:02,800
it just hasn't seen that much success in

02:51:59,920 --> 02:52:02,800
the broader sense

02:52:03,439 --> 02:52:07,359
i was moving to institutional funding

02:52:09,600 --> 02:52:12,960
with institutional funding

02:52:13,439 --> 02:52:15,840
um

02:52:17,520 --> 02:52:21,359
we have three broad spaces we have

02:52:20,560 --> 02:52:24,240
grants

02:52:21,359 --> 02:52:25,840
which are people and organizations that

02:52:24,240 --> 02:52:27,840
like have all this money

02:52:25,840 --> 02:52:30,240
and they are trying to support the

02:52:27,840 --> 02:52:33,520
social good

02:52:30,240 --> 02:52:33,520
and or avoid taxes

02:52:33,600 --> 02:52:36,560
that usually comes with restrictive

02:52:34,880 --> 02:52:38,240
terms you can only spend that money on

02:52:36,560 --> 02:52:41,520
certain things

02:52:38,240 --> 02:52:44,080
and often it's these large like

02:52:41,520 --> 02:52:45,439
large large funds which you know a

02:52:44,080 --> 02:52:47,040
project that hasn't has been getting

02:52:45,439 --> 02:52:48,560
like five dollars here and there

02:52:47,040 --> 02:52:50,160
suddenly gets ten thousand dollars what

02:52:48,560 --> 02:52:51,359
do they even do with it

02:52:50,160 --> 02:52:53,040
what happens when that ten thousand

02:52:51,359 --> 02:52:53,680
dollars goes away and they've hired

02:52:53,040 --> 02:52:55,120
people

02:52:53,680 --> 02:52:56,880
right do they then have to work more on

02:52:55,120 --> 02:53:00,240
these grants

02:52:56,880 --> 02:53:01,040
there's sponsorships often with direct

02:53:00,240 --> 02:53:04,399
strings

02:53:01,040 --> 02:53:06,080
and again limitations sometimes this is

02:53:04,399 --> 02:53:07,920
indirect this is the idea that

02:53:06,080 --> 02:53:09,200
you have 20 of your time to work on

02:53:07,920 --> 02:53:11,840
something free

02:53:09,200 --> 02:53:12,240
or that you just have a job so that you

02:53:11,840 --> 02:53:14,240
can

02:53:12,240 --> 02:53:15,439
fund your side projects working on these

02:53:14,240 --> 02:53:16,960
things

02:53:15,439 --> 02:53:19,840
and those provide these subtle

02:53:16,960 --> 02:53:21,840
influences sometimes through advertising

02:53:19,840 --> 02:53:24,240
the last one the biggest one the one

02:53:21,840 --> 02:53:25,920
that's like the greatest source

02:53:24,240 --> 02:53:27,439
of public goods funding right now is

02:53:25,920 --> 02:53:30,479
taxes

02:53:27,439 --> 02:53:32,000
uh this has all of the the political

02:53:30,479 --> 02:53:35,359
arguments we could make about

02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:37,120
uh bureaucracies and really it's a lot

02:53:35,359 --> 02:53:39,279
of it comes down to poor distribution

02:53:37,120 --> 02:53:43,040
it doesn't go to the projects that are

02:53:39,279 --> 02:53:43,040
needed which leads to underfunding

02:53:44,479 --> 02:53:50,080
so the last one just touch on here is

02:53:48,479 --> 02:53:52,240
malicious

02:53:50,080 --> 02:53:53,760
this is what we really get to when we

02:53:52,240 --> 02:53:56,000
talk about uh

02:53:53,760 --> 02:53:57,279
this big divide right this is the idea

02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:59,760
of

02:53:57,279 --> 02:54:00,960
providing something for free of charge

02:53:59,760 --> 02:54:04,080
in exchange

02:54:00,960 --> 02:54:06,640
uh for making you the product

02:54:04,080 --> 02:54:07,520
right they do that through manipulation

02:54:06,640 --> 02:54:12,000
and surveillance

02:54:07,520 --> 02:54:12,000
the game can control over the consumer

02:54:13,279 --> 02:54:17,200
so what's being worked on right now all

02:54:14,880 --> 02:54:20,560
right where's the snowdrift shirt

02:54:17,200 --> 02:54:24,240
pointing to the snowdrift picture

02:54:20,560 --> 02:54:27,600
clearly involves no drift

02:54:24,240 --> 02:54:29,840
well there's a number of things

02:54:27,600 --> 02:54:30,960
first one i want to talk about tide lift

02:54:29,840 --> 02:54:34,160
they're pretty cool

02:54:30,960 --> 02:54:38,319
uh they're approaching this

02:54:34,160 --> 02:54:38,319
challenge of how do you

02:54:39,040 --> 02:54:42,240
give money and support and fund those

02:54:41,520 --> 02:54:45,279
libraries

02:54:42,240 --> 02:54:48,319
like ssl how do you how do you

02:54:45,279 --> 02:54:51,439
uh fund the stuff that no one sees

02:54:48,319 --> 02:54:53,359
and they do it through basically

02:54:51,439 --> 02:54:54,720
maintaining updates and charging the big

02:54:53,359 --> 02:54:55,200
companies and projects that are using

02:54:54,720 --> 02:54:57,520
those

02:54:55,200 --> 02:54:59,840
libraries and then passing that out of

02:54:57,520 --> 02:55:03,359
distributing it

02:54:59,840 --> 02:55:07,520
there's github sponsors it's been um

02:55:03,359 --> 02:55:11,200
it's been discussed uh somewhat more

02:55:07,520 --> 02:55:11,840
but it's great it's great that you can

02:55:11,200 --> 02:55:13,439
get

02:55:11,840 --> 02:55:15,920
so many people so many eyes on these

02:55:13,439 --> 02:55:18,240
projects because github is this huge

02:55:15,920 --> 02:55:20,319
software forge

02:55:18,240 --> 02:55:22,960
but because it's such a huge software

02:55:20,319 --> 02:55:26,399
forge um

02:55:22,960 --> 02:55:28,479
well it uh it

02:55:26,399 --> 02:55:30,000
doesn't necessarily give money to again

02:55:28,479 --> 02:55:32,000
where it's needed

02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:34,000
and maybe it disperses it too much and

02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:35,680
it still has a lot of these problems

02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:37,439
where there's still donations right

02:55:35,680 --> 02:55:41,520
still going into some of these

02:55:37,439 --> 02:55:43,760
current models then there's snowdrift

02:55:41,520 --> 02:55:45,120
and i'll talk about senator real briefly

02:55:43,760 --> 02:55:47,200
here but then

02:55:45,120 --> 02:55:48,319
there's also tons more uh we actually

02:55:47,200 --> 02:55:50,160
we've compiled

02:55:48,319 --> 02:55:51,439
well we've compiled all the research but

02:55:50,160 --> 02:55:54,720
we've done research on over

02:55:51,439 --> 02:55:55,840
700 of these public goods funding sites

02:55:54,720 --> 02:55:58,960
and it's on our wiki

02:55:55,840 --> 02:56:01,279
and we've compiled hundreds of them um

02:55:58,960 --> 02:56:04,960
actually showing it because they were

02:56:01,279 --> 02:56:04,960
more popular more interesting ones

02:56:05,120 --> 02:56:12,479
now snowdrift dot co crowd matching for

02:56:08,560 --> 02:56:16,319
public kids

02:56:12,479 --> 02:56:16,319
now snowdrift is uh

02:56:16,720 --> 02:56:20,000
i've been working on this thing called

02:56:18,160 --> 02:56:22,960
crab matching

02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:23,760
the idea of crowd matching addresses

02:56:22,960 --> 02:56:28,640
some of these

02:56:23,760 --> 02:56:32,319
questions and points so each month

02:56:28,640 --> 02:56:35,200
you donate you pledge

02:56:32,319 --> 02:56:38,160
the amount you donate is really small

02:56:35,200 --> 02:56:41,279
like 10th of a penny small

02:56:38,160 --> 02:56:43,520
but it's that number times the number of

02:56:41,279 --> 02:56:46,880
other people who make that same pledge

02:56:43,520 --> 02:56:50,000
and so what happens is that

02:56:46,880 --> 02:56:51,600
as more patrons join you end up giving a

02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:54,160
little more

02:56:51,600 --> 02:56:56,960
and not only do you give a little more

02:56:54,160 --> 02:56:59,279
but everyone else gives a little more

02:56:56,960 --> 02:57:01,600
because it gets back to that idea you're

02:56:59,279 --> 02:57:05,439
all trying to support the project

02:57:01,600 --> 02:57:07,279
you're all there uh coordinating

02:57:05,439 --> 02:57:09,760
to really push something forward to make

02:57:07,279 --> 02:57:11,920
something sustainable

02:57:09,760 --> 02:57:13,439
and mathematically it's interesting in

02:57:11,920 --> 02:57:16,399
that the current

02:57:13,439 --> 02:57:17,279
idea behind this has a linear growth in

02:57:16,399 --> 02:57:19,520
the amount you give

02:57:17,279 --> 02:57:22,240
but a quadratic growth in the amount

02:57:19,520 --> 02:57:25,040
that the project receives

02:57:22,240 --> 02:57:25,439
so we're different as you'd expect as

02:57:25,040 --> 02:57:27,200
far as

02:57:25,439 --> 02:57:29,520
right here part of this community part

02:57:27,200 --> 02:57:31,520
of why i'm interested in this project

02:57:29,520 --> 02:57:33,040
we're different because mutual assurance

02:57:31,520 --> 02:57:35,359
that's the big thing the coordination

02:57:33,040 --> 02:57:37,920
problem that's what we're hidden

02:57:35,359 --> 02:57:38,399
it's ongoing is a subscription type

02:57:37,920 --> 02:57:39,760
model

02:57:38,399 --> 02:57:41,760
because it's sustainability is what we

02:57:39,760 --> 02:57:44,720
care about we don't just want to launch

02:57:41,760 --> 02:57:46,000
the project we want them to actually run

02:57:44,720 --> 02:57:49,040
we want them to be able to hire

02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:52,000
full-time developers full-time designers

02:57:49,040 --> 02:57:52,479
we only work for public goods sure the

02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:55,359
model

02:57:52,479 --> 02:57:57,600
could be and and is to some extent our

02:57:55,359 --> 02:57:59,760
places are trying to work on it but

02:57:57,600 --> 02:58:00,960
really this is for public goods it's

02:57:59,760 --> 02:58:04,160
addressing a problem

02:58:00,960 --> 02:58:06,319
that doesn't have a good solution

02:58:04,160 --> 02:58:07,840
and i should say we are definitely

02:58:06,319 --> 02:58:09,600
addressing the

02:58:07,840 --> 02:58:11,279
the projects that are more end user

02:58:09,600 --> 02:58:14,800
focused projects that

02:58:11,279 --> 02:58:17,520
are that uh

02:58:14,800 --> 02:58:18,080
things people see and touch and use not

02:58:17,520 --> 02:58:20,640
necessarily

02:58:18,080 --> 02:58:21,200
all public goods right now you know

02:58:20,640 --> 02:58:23,200
we've talked

02:58:21,200 --> 02:58:25,680
a lot about this being more software

02:58:23,200 --> 02:58:28,960
driven but we definitely want to support

02:58:25,680 --> 02:58:30,479
journalism research art

02:58:28,960 --> 02:58:32,319
but really it makes sense for public

02:58:30,479 --> 02:58:33,200
goods because of all the things we

02:58:32,319 --> 02:58:36,240
discussed about

02:58:33,200 --> 02:58:39,520
what makes public goods public goods

02:58:36,240 --> 02:58:40,880
we don't take any fees we are like a

02:58:39,520 --> 02:58:43,520
freely pre-open source

02:58:40,880 --> 02:58:44,000
software project we we're a public good

02:58:43,520 --> 02:58:46,319
and

02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:48,000
we expect to use our own platform to

02:58:46,319 --> 02:58:50,399
fund ourselves

02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:52,240
which of course puts us as a nonprofit

02:58:50,399 --> 02:58:55,279
and we

02:58:52,240 --> 02:58:57,760
have been cooperatively run

02:58:55,279 --> 02:58:58,319
operated and in the future that's this

02:58:57,760 --> 02:59:02,080
is

02:58:58,319 --> 02:59:02,080
the area we work in and care about

02:59:02,640 --> 02:59:08,160
so i'll make the call for help

02:59:06,080 --> 02:59:09,200
we need it we've been around for a long

02:59:08,160 --> 02:59:12,560
time

02:59:09,200 --> 02:59:14,319
and we're still not launched launched

02:59:12,560 --> 02:59:16,000
we have a ton of technical work we have

02:59:14,319 --> 02:59:19,279
a ton of

02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:22,080
uh knowledge work we've done

02:59:19,279 --> 02:59:23,520
but we don't have quite enough to get

02:59:22,080 --> 02:59:24,160
there because we're all volunteers right

02:59:23,520 --> 02:59:25,680
now

02:59:24,160 --> 02:59:27,359
right we haven't gone out and gotten

02:59:25,680 --> 02:59:30,880
those grants we haven't

02:59:27,359 --> 02:59:32,720
gone into these systems of funding

02:59:30,880 --> 02:59:34,960
so if you're a developer or if you know

02:59:32,720 --> 02:59:38,160
developers who are interested

02:59:34,960 --> 02:59:41,200
frontend dev css we're

02:59:38,160 --> 02:59:42,000
using elm and haskell and happy to talk

02:59:41,200 --> 02:59:45,520
about that more

02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:48,399
later and that's our back end as well

02:59:45,520 --> 02:59:48,880
um organizational you know it costs

02:59:48,399 --> 02:59:51,600
money

02:59:48,880 --> 02:59:52,240
to write terms of service uh you know

02:59:51,600 --> 02:59:54,240
you can

02:59:52,240 --> 02:59:55,439
copy boilerplate all you want but we

02:59:54,240 --> 02:59:56,319
actually care we want them to be

02:59:55,439 --> 02:59:59,520
understood and

02:59:56,319 --> 03:00:00,319
reasonable for people could use program

02:59:59,520 --> 03:00:03,680
managers

03:00:00,319 --> 03:00:05,439
uh a bunch of volunteer cats

03:00:03,680 --> 03:00:08,560
and of course uh getting all this

03:00:05,439 --> 03:00:10,960
cooperative stuff structured is

03:00:08,560 --> 03:00:12,240
always valuable community i'm the

03:00:10,960 --> 03:00:14,800
community director by

03:00:12,240 --> 03:00:16,080
title but you know we all wear a lot of

03:00:14,800 --> 03:00:18,880
hats right now

03:00:16,080 --> 03:00:20,399
but it's you know writing outreach uh

03:00:18,880 --> 03:00:22,880
moderation of the different

03:00:20,399 --> 03:00:24,160
communication platforms and channels and

03:00:22,880 --> 03:00:25,760
so we have a how to help page it's a

03:00:24,160 --> 03:00:29,120
little bit crusty but

03:00:25,760 --> 03:00:30,720
check it out and um

03:00:29,120 --> 03:00:32,560
here's some of those platforms right we

03:00:30,720 --> 03:00:36,319
have the form we have

03:00:32,560 --> 03:00:37,840
irc and matrix email masks on twitter

03:00:36,319 --> 03:00:39,760
probably end up in other places if we

03:00:37,840 --> 03:00:43,279
have more help so

03:00:39,760 --> 03:00:46,800
i do appreciate anyone who can uh

03:00:43,279 --> 03:00:49,200
can help out i'm gonna

03:00:46,800 --> 03:00:53,040
almost end here and basically talk about

03:00:49,200 --> 03:00:55,520
what is the future we've talked about

03:00:53,040 --> 03:00:57,040
these being wicked problems wicked

03:00:55,520 --> 03:01:00,240
problems mean that

03:00:57,040 --> 03:01:02,160
one approach won't suffice to fix them

03:01:00,240 --> 03:01:04,080
it means that all these projects need

03:01:02,160 --> 03:01:07,359
help

03:01:04,080 --> 03:01:09,600
and there's been some policy pushes

03:01:07,359 --> 03:01:10,560
more so in europe but i'm i'm really

03:01:09,600 --> 03:01:12,720
excited about them

03:01:10,560 --> 03:01:16,000
it's these ideas that anything that's

03:01:12,720 --> 03:01:18,960
tax funded should be flow

03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:20,080
the public should own any public goods

03:01:18,960 --> 03:01:21,840
that were created using

03:01:20,080 --> 03:01:24,399
public funds i mean that just makes

03:01:21,840 --> 03:01:24,399
sense to me

03:01:28,080 --> 03:01:35,439
beyond platforms and projects

03:01:32,399 --> 03:01:37,680
that are trying to fund uh public goods

03:01:35,439 --> 03:01:40,800
and enable this funding

03:01:37,680 --> 03:01:41,520
time is one of the most invaluable

03:01:40,800 --> 03:01:44,560
resources

03:01:41,520 --> 03:01:46,880
right valuable and invaluable

03:01:44,560 --> 03:01:49,120
people are willingly giving their say

03:01:46,880 --> 03:01:50,800
right they're shoveling that snow

03:01:49,120 --> 03:01:52,560
i didn't really touch on the game theory

03:01:50,800 --> 03:01:54,319
problem about our name

03:01:52,560 --> 03:01:55,840
and shorten time so i won't right now

03:01:54,319 --> 03:01:59,600
but my

03:01:55,840 --> 03:02:01,040
interest and why i've transitioned kind

03:01:59,600 --> 03:02:03,600
of from a practitioner

03:02:01,040 --> 03:02:05,359
to a researcher it stems from this

03:02:03,600 --> 03:02:07,600
vision

03:02:05,359 --> 03:02:08,479
this vision of what if we're instead of

03:02:07,600 --> 03:02:10,720
talking about

03:02:08,479 --> 03:02:11,680
eight percent ten percent twelve percent

03:02:10,720 --> 03:02:13,680
unemployment

03:02:11,680 --> 03:02:16,160
we were considering sixty percent

03:02:13,680 --> 03:02:19,760
seventy percent eighty percent

03:02:16,160 --> 03:02:21,920
now covet 19 pandemic it has been

03:02:19,760 --> 03:02:24,399
a struggle we're at this virtual

03:02:21,920 --> 03:02:24,399
conference

03:02:24,640 --> 03:02:30,560
and of those struggles unprecedented

03:02:28,399 --> 03:02:32,160
as i'm sure we're all used to hearing

03:02:30,560 --> 03:02:35,200
and now that word

03:02:32,160 --> 03:02:36,880
uh levels of unemployment and

03:02:35,200 --> 03:02:38,399
the economy has not yet totally

03:02:36,880 --> 03:02:42,800
collapsed

03:02:38,399 --> 03:02:44,399
hopefully won't it's pretty interesting

03:02:42,800 --> 03:02:46,800
i'm interested in what would look like

03:02:44,399 --> 03:02:48,640
if we didn't force people back to work

03:02:46,800 --> 03:02:50,800
would they create public goods would

03:02:48,640 --> 03:02:53,600
they give more of that time

03:02:50,800 --> 03:02:55,279
and move us towards a big and little f

03:02:53,600 --> 03:02:57,520
free world

03:02:55,279 --> 03:02:59,040
could this lead to the free software

03:02:57,520 --> 03:03:02,000
movement utopia

03:02:59,040 --> 03:03:02,399
that was discussed by stephen martin in

03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:04,880
uh

03:03:02,399 --> 03:03:07,680
20 years ago in milestones on the way to

03:03:04,880 --> 03:03:09,600
the gpl society

03:03:07,680 --> 03:03:11,359
i don't know i don't know if the future

03:03:09,600 --> 03:03:15,279
is going to be ubi

03:03:11,359 --> 03:03:18,560
ubs blockchain economy i i'm not sure

03:03:15,279 --> 03:03:20,399
i do know that i want to believe i

03:03:18,560 --> 03:03:23,439
believe that we'll be in a more free

03:03:20,399 --> 03:03:27,040
libre open space than today

03:03:23,439 --> 03:03:29,439
and finally just to close

03:03:27,040 --> 03:03:30,880
so drift has been active for many years

03:03:29,439 --> 03:03:32,640
despite not launching

03:03:30,880 --> 03:03:34,479
we've been deeply engaged with these

03:03:32,640 --> 03:03:36,319
conversations and topics

03:03:34,479 --> 03:03:37,840
producing hundreds of pages on our wiki

03:03:36,319 --> 03:03:39,200
and elsewhere

03:03:37,840 --> 03:03:41,279
recently we've had this discussion

03:03:39,200 --> 03:03:42,160
surfacing about our own missions and

03:03:41,279 --> 03:03:44,880
goals

03:03:42,160 --> 03:03:46,160
and no decisions have been made but i'm

03:03:44,880 --> 03:03:48,720
pretty excited for

03:03:46,160 --> 03:03:50,399
this potential where we consider crowd

03:03:48,720 --> 03:03:52,840
batching just one of many

03:03:50,399 --> 03:03:55,359
projects and experiments that we think

03:03:52,840 --> 03:03:58,319
through that we release

03:03:55,359 --> 03:03:59,840
in a just kind of setting some sort of a

03:03:58,319 --> 03:04:02,479
group that's thinking deeply about the

03:03:59,840 --> 03:04:05,920
future of sustainable public goods

03:04:02,479 --> 03:04:08,399
with that so thank you very much for

03:04:05,920 --> 03:04:10,000
all of your time really appreciate it

03:04:08,399 --> 03:04:13,680
and um

03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:15,120
i do want to shout out to slide carnival

03:04:13,680 --> 03:04:15,840
and one of my students introduced me

03:04:15,120 --> 03:04:18,319
this

03:04:15,840 --> 03:04:19,200

03:04:32,319 --> 03:04:39,600

03:04:39,600 --> 03:04:47,359
virtual and uh please

03:04:43,279 --> 03:04:49,600
feel free to ask about that and um

03:04:47,359 --> 03:04:51,279
yeah i think we have maybe a few minutes

03:04:49,600 --> 03:04:54,960
for questions here

03:04:51,279 --> 03:04:56,720
uh i'm at altsalt.net salt on a lot of

03:04:54,960 --> 03:04:59,760
irc matrix places and

03:04:56,720 --> 03:05:04,399
uh of course using ccpi

03:04:59,760 --> 03:05:07,200
sa so with that thank you very much um

03:05:04,399 --> 03:05:07,680
i'm going to click on the shared notes

03:05:07,200 --> 03:05:10,080
and

03:05:07,680 --> 03:05:11,840
see if it breaks everything thank you

03:05:10,080 --> 03:05:13,279
very much for your presentation

03:05:11,840 --> 03:05:15,120
we have two questions for you at the

03:05:13,279 --> 03:05:18,560
shared notes

03:05:15,120 --> 03:05:19,200
all right so um the first question here

03:05:18,560 --> 03:05:21,439
is

03:05:19,200 --> 03:05:23,439
on yesterday's talk about uh krita's

03:05:21,439 --> 03:05:25,439
funding

03:05:23,439 --> 03:05:27,040
hello said that she's uh not so

03:05:25,439 --> 03:05:28,960
interested in focusing on features

03:05:27,040 --> 03:05:31,359
requested by companies

03:05:28,960 --> 03:05:33,120
because most don't support the project

03:05:31,359 --> 03:05:34,160
whereas individual users are more likely

03:05:33,120 --> 03:05:35,920
to support

03:05:34,160 --> 03:05:37,760
so what are some funding options where

03:05:35,920 --> 03:05:38,399
more people who are making use of the

03:05:37,760 --> 03:05:40,960
software

03:05:38,399 --> 03:05:42,240
get to support the software and that's

03:05:40,960 --> 03:05:44,560
that's definitely

03:05:42,240 --> 03:05:45,279
snowdrift is that's exactly what we're

03:05:44,560 --> 03:05:48,479
looking at

03:05:45,279 --> 03:05:51,680
um there are a lot of other ones

03:05:48,479 --> 03:05:53,359
and if you go to our wiki and look at

03:05:51,680 --> 03:05:55,279
i think it's called the market research

03:05:53,359 --> 03:05:58,000
section it talks about other

03:05:55,279 --> 03:05:58,000
crowdfunding

03:05:58,840 --> 03:06:02,880
projects and there are some that are

03:06:01,920 --> 03:06:05,840
currently active

03:06:02,880 --> 03:06:07,200
and working i don't wanna just name them

03:06:05,840 --> 03:06:10,560
because uh

03:06:07,200 --> 03:06:12,479
again looked like over 700 and we've

03:06:10,560 --> 03:06:14,880
explored why some are better or worse

03:06:12,479 --> 03:06:15,359
than others the hope is that snowdrift

03:06:14,880 --> 03:06:18,319
will be

03:06:15,359 --> 03:06:20,640
the one that i can point you to in the

03:06:18,319 --> 03:06:22,800
very near future

03:06:20,640 --> 03:06:24,960
and the second question here is is what

03:06:22,800 --> 03:06:28,640
do you think of blender's funding model

03:06:24,960 --> 03:06:31,359
um i am not

03:06:28,640 --> 03:06:32,880
immediately aware of lettings blunders

03:06:31,359 --> 03:06:33,840
funding model if someone wants to put

03:06:32,880 --> 03:06:36,160
that

03:06:33,840 --> 03:06:37,279
either in the notes or chat because i

03:06:36,160 --> 03:06:40,479
want to

03:06:37,279 --> 03:06:40,960
research it right here but i know that

03:06:40,479 --> 03:06:44,000
at least

03:06:40,960 --> 03:06:45,680
in part blender's been super super

03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:48,319
successful

03:06:45,680 --> 03:06:49,840
in uh i think they were like maybe maybe

03:06:48,319 --> 03:06:52,800
the initial crowdfunded

03:06:49,840 --> 03:06:54,880
project like on the internet um they've

03:06:52,800 --> 03:06:55,439
been super successful in being one of

03:06:54,880 --> 03:06:58,960
the

03:06:55,439 --> 03:07:02,080
more industry like like

03:06:58,960 --> 03:07:03,680
winners uh and so i assume that part of

03:07:02,080 --> 03:07:05,760
that funding comes from

03:07:03,680 --> 03:07:07,279
the education around blender and the

03:07:05,760 --> 03:07:08,479
commercial use around blender and things

03:07:07,279 --> 03:07:11,040
like that

03:07:08,479 --> 03:07:11,520
and that's really great for something

03:07:11,040 --> 03:07:13,680
that's

03:07:11,520 --> 03:07:16,000
achieved that skill and that competitive

03:07:13,680 --> 03:07:18,640
position

03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:19,600
but that's not the the kind of projects

03:07:18,640 --> 03:07:22,880
as a whole this is

03:07:19,600 --> 03:07:26,720
the chat here let's see

03:07:22,880 --> 03:07:31,520
um and what uh

03:07:26,720 --> 03:07:35,600
open prioritization i am not sure

03:07:31,520 --> 03:07:35,600
uh what this one is

03:07:36,160 --> 03:07:40,880
let's see if i click on this would break

03:07:39,359 --> 03:07:41,600
everything i always worry a little bit

03:07:40,880 --> 03:07:47,120
about

03:07:41,600 --> 03:07:50,160
it breaking everything um i hit a 404

03:07:47,120 --> 03:07:51,120
that's because of the markdown i have

03:07:50,160 --> 03:07:53,920
this issue

03:07:51,120 --> 03:07:55,359
other sites experimenting credit funding

03:07:53,920 --> 03:07:58,479
to prioritize

03:07:55,359 --> 03:07:58,960
new features implementations for

03:07:58,479 --> 03:08:01,279
browsers

03:07:58,960 --> 03:08:02,319
so it sounds like a bounty type of

03:08:01,279 --> 03:08:05,680
system

03:08:02,319 --> 03:08:08,319
i have to look into it further i don't

03:08:05,680 --> 03:08:10,000
think it's on our page yet but it will

03:08:08,319 --> 03:08:13,200
be now

03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:14,240
and again i think with that we're at the

03:08:13,200 --> 03:08:16,640
end of the time so

03:08:14,240 --> 03:08:17,600
thank you so much for having me i hope

03:08:16,640 --> 03:08:20,160
to

03:08:17,600 --> 03:08:21,359
see you in the future and thank you very

03:08:20,160 --> 03:08:22,319
much

03:08:21,359 --> 03:08:24,640
thank you very much for your

03:08:22,319 --> 03:08:27,920
presentation and thank you all for
