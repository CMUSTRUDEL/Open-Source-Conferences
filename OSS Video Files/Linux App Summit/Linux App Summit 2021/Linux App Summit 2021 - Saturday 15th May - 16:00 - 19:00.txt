thank you

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,920
thank you very much for being here

could you please rejoin the audio for me

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,279
today we're going to ask some questions

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,000
and get some answers

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,680
um i think it's probably easiest if we

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,800
go alphabetically

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:26,640
in name order first name

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,920
just to to make things a little simple

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,399
um so to start off

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,200
i'd love uh if each of you could give a

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,279
brief introduction of yourselves

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,200
obviously we know your names but let us

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,080
know your name maybe we're pronouncing

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,800
it incorrectly

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,680
where you're currently based uh which

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,279
open source

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,959
projects and communities you're

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,360
affiliated with and

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,839
maybe just a little highlight from the

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,839
pandemic

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:04,000
should i stop okay

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,760
so my name is anita hooper and i'm

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,079
currently based in berlin

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,519
and i'm working with kde as a marketing

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,640
consultant

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,399
and i think the highlight for me for

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,279
pandemic was that i moved

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,240
to berlin and as kde i think it didn't

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,519
change much

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,760
but yes we'd have more online events

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,760
now

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:34,480

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:49,760
germany but not only i would be

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,240
i would be living in in asia of course

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,399
also of the the pandemic i've been

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,519
here for for a while already so i'm

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,560
associated with

00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,000
asia i'm one of the founders of the

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,120
organization as well so this

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,480
is a singapore based organization that

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,839
developed open source

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:11,200
uh software and hardware and i will go

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:14,560
to try to foster open source

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,320
movement in asia and uh

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,640
beside development of software and

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,800
hardware we also organized um

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,480
events uh similar to this we had the

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,600
frost asia annual

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,680
summit we run a lot of um online

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,360
programs to show people how to code and

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,200
contribute to various open source

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,680
projects

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:38,560
the pandemic i think is um

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,680
impact everywhere um everyone around the

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,160
world and also

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:47,279
of course like devos asia community

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,440
uh in several ways so um

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,440
just three weeks ago our one of our call

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,279
maintainer passed away in india when he

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,560
was only 26

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:59,120
and you know the situation in that is

00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,720
so bad and there are a majority of our

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,000
contributors coming from india and of

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,720
course it influenced

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,760
the development of of the projects yeah

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,000
the the people

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,639
really just they uh they struggling to

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,399
to survive so um being able to

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,480
contribute open source it's really

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,760
difficult now for for developers coming

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,639
from of that

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,360
region we're doing hardware development

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,000
the production of hardware significant

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,639
significantly uh slow downs due to the

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,360
pandemic disruptive of components

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,120
uh cheap production is also the pricing

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,839
also increased really high for us

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,959
like for organizations that will develop

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,360
open source hardware

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,240
so a lot of things happening at the

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,040
moment

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,399
um very challenging in order to to

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,360
sustain um

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:50,480
the community but i'm i'm glad that we

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,600
still be able to um

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,320
to to stay uh together and continue what

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,600
we are

00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,240
doing similar to uh to the linux app um

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,839
summit we run our first asia summit

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,600
online this year

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:09,680
as well so this is uh some of the

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,680
highlights related to the pandemic

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,560
well thank you it looks like we lost

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,079

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,480
that out manuel why don't you tell us

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,959

of the country

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:37,519
and we have i i am working with

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:41,120
with open source for about

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:43,199
25 years uh my professional career i

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,240
i was starting working with the unix

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:48,560
system so

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:53,120
the evolution to linux to open source

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:56,639
was very natural for me so uh

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,920
here at mexico we are working we have

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,959
nine years working to to a strange

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,560
uh forced community around all the in

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,600
the country of mexico

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:11,600
we we have a very important community

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:15,199
named the open source lab in spanish is

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:18,160
laboratories because my shirt is lapseal

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:20,639
laboratory the software libre say is the

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:24,800
the name of community of our community

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:27,600
right now we have 65 university

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,160
restraint in the the community open

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,880
source

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,360
around the around these universities as

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,360
you see

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,920
is academy as a community of academics

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,519
of universities working together to to

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,480
create to develop

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,600
innovation projects every project all

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,320
the

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,199
is exclusively we are working with false

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,320
technologies

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:53,519
so we are uh confirming a very strong

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,800
community using development develop

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,360
develop and adopting the use of open

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,240
source

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,920
open source software here in mexico open

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,839
source lab community

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,880
is working develop development uh

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:12,000
maybe around 50

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:16,240

students from the university working to

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,760
develop this kind of project so

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,720
this i think is a very very important

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,360

google open source community so we are

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,000
trying to align with very important

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,880

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,959
currently

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:51,040
living in sweden and um

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,000
i moved over to sweden basically during

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,880
the pandemic

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,519
uh so there's uh quite a whole lot of

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,040
changes

00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,920
uh i'm about the member for the gnome

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,040
foundation

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:06,480
and i'm also part of the

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:10,559
founding members from gnome africa uh

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:13,600
i think uh basically uh

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,760
how did the pandemic affect us uh yeah

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,120
it did in several ways um

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,799
first we were supposed to have the first

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,559
events in africa for the first time for

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,120
grown foundation

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,959
but then um it happened at the time when

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,480
the pandemic just started so we had to

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,200
postpone that

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,799
and so we had a little bit of um

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,840
enthusiasm that

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:36,000
went um you know not um a bit

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,440
reduced because everyone was

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,919
anticipating the event

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,000
and you know having to introduce gnome

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:45,039
um to africa for the first time it was

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,440
what we all were looking out for but

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,919
then

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,840
um we you know we compensated that by

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,080
having a virtual event

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,840
um towards the end of the year which is

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,120
quite um successful we had quite a

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,160
number of people

00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,000
attend the event um um right now

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,200
basically what we're trying to do is to

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,559
see how we

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:07,520
can get into um

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,960
african universities mainly um by having

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,960
the gnome uh

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,480
um university outreach initiative in

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,640
africa universities for the first time

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,679
it's quite a very big

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,520
um project for us at the moment because

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,720
you know uh

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:25,280
open source in africa is um

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,880
still at its developing stage and still

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,039
so much of introduction to do

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,000
and all of that but then we are quite

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,320
excited that

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,400
we have quite a number of um

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,280
applications and we

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,919
are looking forward to see um how um

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,120
glom foundation will be embraced around

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,120
universities in africa so i think that's

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,360
basically

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,039
how the pandemic has affected us as a

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,600
people um

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,559
yeah i think africa is a very unique

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,000
place

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:58,000
so motivations

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,919
come in different forms as to what you

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,559
have in other parts of the world

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,240
and so the way we treat um events um

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,360
here basically is different and the way

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,679
people get motivated to want to do

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,960
partaking open source also is a lot

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,360
different

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,240
uh so we are now we're trying to look at

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,919
um

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,919
other aspects um of um um

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:24,000
introducing people and you know possibly

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,640
running more projects that is um i'm

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,679
going to be

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,360
possibly like a little bit of

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,720
compensation for this for the work

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,880
they're going to be doing open source to

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,880
bringing more people into the project

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,720
for gloom foundation and so we are

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,440
basically at the developing stage

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,559
uh and we're learning on the go at the

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,440
moment um

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,559
you know trying to find out more of what

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,120
people require

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,520
and how we could best feed contributors

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,120
coming from african-american projects

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,880
and i think that's basically where we

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,559
are at the moment uh thank you alison

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,440
once again i again apologize that i

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,919
can't

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,760
do my video at the moment and i hope the

00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,480
background is not noisy like uh

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,679
i discussed okay oh thank you that's

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,840
okay

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,360
all right well thank you regina it was

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,360
great to hear

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:11,840

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,919
mistaka please introduce yourself uh let

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,200
us know where you're currently based

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,280
which open source projects and

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,280
communities you're affiliated with

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,480
and if you don't mind provide a little

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,919
highlight

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,799
something that's happened in your life

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:28,159
since the pandemic or your community is

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,159
live since the pandemic

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:35,840
you'll need to unmute yourself

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:49,280
hey maybe tomas would you mind sharing

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:53,919
with us hello

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:56,320
hi welcome hello hello

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,120
let me just remove this thingy from my

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,880
hair just a sec

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,559
so hi i am thomas i am from the kg

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,440
project

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,480
and i do think that open source is on my

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,200
life for almost

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,799
20 years and i do program professionally

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,679
for open source on 16

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,000
of those years there is one thing that i

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,720
try

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,559
to do as much as programming that is to

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,039
create communities and try to make

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:26,400
people also do things on open source

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:29,200
so my wife hates me because of that

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,120
because usually i take my vacations

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,360
sorry

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,720
going to universities and teaching how

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,320
to start

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,520
contributing to open source i've been

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,559
doing this in brazil

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:45,120
for the past 10 years and i'm also a

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,760
google summer of code mentor for most of

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,200
those years

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,679
um usually i got in contact

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,760
with professors on universities i talk

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,600
to them i ask them if they like open

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,200
source or if they don't or if they

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,559
actually know open source because one

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,559
thing that i discovered that's

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,080
most of the universities at least inside

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,480
of brazil

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,480
they don't actually understand what they

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,880
have open source means they think that

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,919
it's

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,400
just software that it's free but it's

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,039
not

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,000
that i mean with no open source we know

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:19,200
that it's much more than that

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
and then i go there and i talk to them

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,960
and then

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,520
usually they allow me to do a 40-hour

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,320
course

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,120
for free i've never charged it for those

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,600
with the

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,760
only intention of training the students

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:35,200
on the tools that we use professionally

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:38,640
and how to contribute to something

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:41,760
and this has been how i created the

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,840
kd brazil um

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,480
when i say that i created the kd brazil

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,679
there was a kd brazil before me but it

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,559
was three members

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,840
for five or six years as soon as i

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,520
started to do that

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:58,960
we grew to almost 50 members

00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:02,240
and most of them are contributors

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,080
some with codes we have now around 12

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,760
contributors with code

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,840
but we have way way

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,880
more than that contributors for

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:15,280
translations and

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,400
ux for more projects like kd because

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,400
it's not because i

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,760
am inside of the kde projects that i

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,039
will only focus

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,919
on kd software so so

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:28,000
i've also pushed people through gun

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:31,200
foundation i've also pushed people

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,320
to mono and i really

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:37,919
like how i

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,960
am how do i say i really like the things

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,520
that are happening

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,120
because i have the time to go and do

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,720
those things

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,640
um this year i got i actually want to

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,039
talk to regina because of this uh

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,559
i got a student from maputo in

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,400
mozambique

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,640
asking me if i could go there and do a

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,919
course in africa and i said of course i

00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,360
just need a few days of

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:03,120
vacation and i i am not even

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,279
going to try to charge because it would

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,320
be my pleasure to teach

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:11,760
for people outside of brazil

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,720
and then i also got contacts from a

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,679
teacher

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,679
in vancouver and only because of corona

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,279
i'm not doing those things this year but

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,760
as soon as corona ends i'm

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,279
going there and i'm gonna try to start

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,600
communities

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,640
not waiting for them for that because

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,200
i've waited

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,039
for someone to teach me how to start an

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,679
open source for a long time

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,760
and it took me almost four years with

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,480
fears that people would laugh about my

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,880
codes

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,960
with fears that i would be judged so if

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,600
you have somebody that already knows how

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,640
to

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,360
open source take the time

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,679
go to universities talk to teachers talk

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,559
to students and see if the students

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,840
are willing to use open source or they

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,159
are

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,600
as their conclusion projects because

00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,679
i've seen that this

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,159
makes them quite happy to have more

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,919
people looking at the codes and it makes

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,520
them happy because it would be

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:09,919
a code that matters because usually

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,240
from what i saw as soon as the student

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:15,360
finishes his conclusion projects

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:19,919
cabin owns it

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:22,559
so this makes everything better

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,840
and this is how i am trying to create

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:27,679
communities um

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:30,960
as soon as corona is africa vancouver

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,559
and also university in india and nick i

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,000
think i talked when you can choose

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,720
somebody else about

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,200
going to the uic and doing the same

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,200
thing there

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,080
so yes this is my approach on building

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,360
communities never waiting for them to

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,279
want to start one

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,960
going there and pushing the communities

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:52,400
for them

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:55,919
that's awesome well if if

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,919
katie brazil has any any um

00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,080
example i'm sure the upcoming

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:03,679
communities will be just as thriving

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:07,120
given due time thank you to us

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,840

um let us know where you're currently

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,159
based

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,039
which uh projects and communities you're

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,440
affiliated with

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:40,400
and maybe a brief highlight from the

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,400
from the pandemic

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,960
i'm

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:09,600
our activities is more than

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,600
uh especially uh

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:21,840
i'm very sorry your your connection

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,840
seems to be breaking up quite heavily

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,279
it's quite spotty

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:38,880
hello can you hear us

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:41,919
yes can i um

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:47,520
yes it's it's really

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:47,520
staticky um just just to be aware

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:03,840
is okay

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,399
okay i think we might have lost

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,399
mustafa's audio

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:21,120
i do apologize it seems like there are

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,120
some technical difficulties today

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,720
okay um let's

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,000
let's go into the next question maybe

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,159
myself i can find a better connection

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,200
uh and and jump back into the

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,760
conversation

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,760
i'd love to move on to our our first

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:41,840
real question of the panel

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:45,200
uh digging deep into the topic

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:47,919
uh the question is

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,880
which tomas started to answer already

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,440
actually

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,360
how did you start your community and

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,480
what were some of the challenges you

00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,720
faced

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,360
is there any advice you would like to

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,000
give to someone who is starting a new

00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,000
community

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:08,640
oh yes don't

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:11,679
try to do a linux distribution we have

00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,399
already too many linux distributions

00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,960
pick one and try to have the software

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:21,360
because we do have

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:24,799
um for instance on gmail and on kde

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,960
that are big communities i think we are

00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,399
we both are the combined biggest

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,120
combination of free software that there

00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,200
is

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,640
we have software's that have zero

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,679
maintainers

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,440
so instead of trying to create your

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,320
new linux distro that will take the

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,480
world by storm

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,080
pick a small application that it's

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,440
abandoned

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:50,000
and try to help try to make it better

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,679
with that view you have people helping

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,559
you to starts

00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,960
and things will be not as hard as if you

00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:59,919
are doing everything alone

00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,240
try to find professors and people that

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,679
are

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,960
within the community already try to

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:09,440
push the idea towards your study group

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,760
or your university usually they are open

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,080
sometimes they are not really onto it

00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,679
but

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:18,880
usually it's because they don't know and

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,799
do not wait because there is nothing

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,840
around there or there is no work

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:27,200
based on open source near where you live

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:30,000
because nowadays the work on it

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,799
is global you can work whenever you want

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:37,840
wherever you want

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,840
basically that and don't be shy

00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,240
it's important not to be shy yeah if you

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,960
are shy you're not going to talk to

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,880
people

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,799
if you're not going to talk to people

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,720
nobody will look at your codes your

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,320
mistakes will be still the same mistakes

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,240
that you did as a student because there

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,039
is nobody to correct you

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,159
and don't be scared on people correcting

00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,200
your codes i mean

00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,720
i have 16 years of experience writing

00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,519
source codes

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,200
sometimes my students they find a horse

00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,240
and they fix my codes and i

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,120
am so glad because people fixing my code

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,919
means that i don't need

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,919
to work on that

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,760
thank you well i saw some head mods from

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,279
manuel

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:21,760
and from monica on should i comment

00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,880
um anika would you like to follow up

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,360
with that

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,120
i know you are doing lots of work with

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,720
jump starting the kitty network maybe

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,519
you can pull in some experience from

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,399
there

00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,799
sure so we recently started kde network

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,360
but

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,159
i think it has been very successful and

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,000
in india

00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,159
kerala there were a lot of things

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,880
happening but we had no idea about it

00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,200
actually

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,919
so i feel that starting a new community

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,480
is about

00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,840
finding the right people actually if you

00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,600
find the right people

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,919
you can actually start a community and

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,519
they are if they are dedicated to it

00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,279
because i feel you know if they do it

00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,120
for maybe you know just

00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,799
six months and they just leave you

00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,120
there's no point because you want people

00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,840
with

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,360
long-term commitment because and also

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,960
not just one person that's what we

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,880
decided for kde network

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,640
because if you just have one person that

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,559
person cannot start the community

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,240
you need at least four to five people so

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:14,880
that you know if somebody is busy

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,640
the other person can replace that so in

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,080
india what we did is that we have around

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,559
five people over there

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,880
and just thomas as thomas said that you

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,720
know you need to connect to universities

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,240
but you need someone who can actually

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,279
you know understand the language of the

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,240
community

00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,840
i'm saying about not only the language

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,039
in terms of language but what they

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,000
actually how they

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:38,000
feel their way of communicating because

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,960
that's how you can enter the community

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,240
like um also about the nigeria thing

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,360
which thomas mentioned

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,720
so i feel that if the people are not

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,440
if you're not connected to them you

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:53,200
cannot actually pursue the community

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:56,000
um also i think when kde started in 1996

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,919
um the main thing which kde was lacking

00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,840
was diversity and now we have

00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,519
kd network in india and hopefully we are

00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,600
starting in china as well

00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,840
so i feel that you know this diversity

00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,320
diversity will actually create

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,399
uh harmony and it will bring a lot of a

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,399
lot more people in the community

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:14,559
and the other point which i feel is that

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,000
you need to accept the community

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,080
not only technical person and

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,080
non-technical as well so you need to

00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,039
create that awareness that we are just

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,919
not about

00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:25,840
technical people but also non-technical

00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,000
also and sorry for the mass because i'm

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:31,600
actually in hamburg at the

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,600
central city station so

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:38,320
there to be safe i'm sorry for sure

00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:42,480
absolutely thank you nika hong and then

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:45,519
uh manuel would you like to take it on

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,559
yeah sure well uh as

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:52,240
a teacher of the university uh i

00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:55,919
am i understand absolutely

00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:59,200
the the the words or thomas

00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:02,799
we are trying we are the open source lab

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:05,279
is located at

00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,080
zacatecas state science a technology

00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,119
council

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,839
like a government state so we have we

00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,359
have from the

00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:15,280
the council the approach of the

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,879
the close collaboration with all the

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,079
universities of the state

00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:23,200
so we have we we was

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,639
have three challenge to start this big

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,240
community right now

00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:31,119
the first challenge is to have the truth

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,000
of the universities uh beginning with

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,359
the teachers

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,079
and going with the students because uh

00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,760
there are there are the open source

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:43,200
language the open source

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:47,280
philosophy here in mexico is very low

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:49,440
so we we want we we works to try to

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,560
get the the truth of the students and

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,679
the teachers

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:57,200
the second challenge was uh

00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:59,760
when we had when we

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,839
got the truth of the universities

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,599
teachers and

00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:06,480
students we works to go

00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,359
to a public and the dependence of

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,480
government to

00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:12,320
private companies to have the truth to

00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,880
develop projects around

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,520
open source technologies so but right

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,200
now

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:21,920
we have working to reach

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,040
to allied with big big leaders like

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,480
genome

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:30,000
uh i was the use finished

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:34,000
genome engagement challenge from genome

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:38,720
so this was an amazing experience

00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:42,240
for me because we have more of a 150

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:45,440
projects around the from the maybe

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:48,960
50 60 countries around the world so

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,000
i i i was see the the very important

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,040
philosophy

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,320
of of open source and other noted

00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,440
countries

00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:00,960
than other continents i i

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:03,760
have the pleasure that i i was getting

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,960
i was place i was being in brazil

00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,480
sometimes

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:11,920
i was in in falls i was in porto alegre

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,400
uh the community is big big community

00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,920
but

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:18,800
uh the more important

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,480
the the really the the really matters

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,880
around brazil for me

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:27,040
is the philosophy around open source so

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:30,160
it's it's a very very big

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:33,280
how do you see um

00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:36,560
it's a very important goal for us

00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,440
to work to to create this this

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,800
philosophy

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:44,079
around open source here in mexico uh

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,280
and i mean like uh like i'm a genomic

00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:50,000
member right now

00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:53,119
i am working specifically to work

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,359
to estrange this community so we have

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,520
a lot of students very talented students

00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:59,359
around the open source community

00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,720
uh the open source lab community around

00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:03,760
the around country

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:06,480
and i i i think we have

00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,760
all the talent to start to work we are

00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,160
working to develop

00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,280
a lot of projects all the projects is

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,760
developed

00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,040
with the open source technologies but

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,560
the next step

00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,800
is to work to take this talent to make

00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,640
a very important contributors to

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,119
projects to bigger projects

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,560
uh the open source projects like genome

00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,839
like ide

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,320
like maybe google so there are a lot of

00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,079
there are

00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,760
a lot of leaders there are a lot of

00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,440
projects there are a lot of strategies

00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,800
around open source projects

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:41,040
so we are working to to take

00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,359
these young talents from universities

00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:47,119
and go to these big projects

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:48,880
to make a more important a community of

00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,280
contributors

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,320
and right now in mexico i forget that

00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,599
the last the last

00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:59,119
chance the pandemic we have

00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:02,640
a very very an amazing surprise

00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:06,000
because every month every six months i

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:09,599
before the pandemics we we are we we was

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,640
work with uh 140

00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,160
students every six months but our big

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,040
surprises

00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,440
uh with the when when we go to the

00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,240
pandemic to home office to work from

00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,520
home

00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,960
to this this kind of very complex

00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,400
situation

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:31,119
the people the students follow

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,240
coming to the open source lab a working

00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:36,400
home office

00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,400
and we don't have uh

00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,960
less less students every six months i we

00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,119
have the the same the same

00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,000
production we have the same community is

00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,359
very important for

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,839
us and the students is ready ready to

00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,400
work

00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,680
in this new model this is very important

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,800
for us

00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,000
thank you thank you hong would you like

00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,680
to answer a question

00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,480
uh just in case you need it uh

00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,040
how um did you start your community what

00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,920
were some

00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,520
challenges you faced uh across asia and

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,079
what's some advice that you give to

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:16,320
someone starting a new community

00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:19,920
yeah uh yes so i hope you can hear me

00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:23,680
uh okay good so um how did i start for

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:26,000
asia so uh back in 2009

00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,920
so at that time like the open source

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,839
definition the idea of open source is

00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,240
very new for a country like vietnam i'm

00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:34,400
originally from vietnam by the way

00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,440
and i also did not study computer

00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,839
science myself

00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,359
but during university i got involved in

00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:42,720
the linux user room

00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:44,720
and i got a lot of mentorship from the

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,240
people from community and i soon

00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,800
realized the opportunities

00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,720
uh with open source in developing even

00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,839
countries like southeast asia

00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,680
getting access to um to education is

00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,640
also challenging and people don't get

00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,960
the same

00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,079
kind of education system that you get

00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,359
from from the west

00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,079
you know um and also very limited people

00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,880
have asset

00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,240
internet at that time so we see that

00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,640
with open source

00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,160
there is a huge opportunity for people

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,280
where they can collaborate where they

00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,960
can learn and also

00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,480
the best thing is that they can connect

00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,760
with people from all over the world

00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,560
which is something

00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,240
that's really hard for people in in that

00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,000
particular region

00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,440
so what i did in the beginning my

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,480
partner and i

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,599
uh he has many years um working in open

00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,079
source

00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,960
he originally come from germany moved to

00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,079
asia

00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:39,359
um in the past we started to

00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:41,359
to think of creating a platform where

00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,560
people can meet can exchange ideas so we

00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:45,040
started the first

00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,960
event where we invite people from from

00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,200
europe from the us to come over

00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,160
some we have gnome actually we hosted

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,119
the gnome

00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,640
asia in 2009 in ho chi minh city and

00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,599
this that was the first

00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,200
open source event uh ever in in vietnam

00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,960
we got a lot of um

00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,560
attendees a lot of interest from the

00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,280
community people come

00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:07,119
uh uh let each and the idea to share

00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,520
more about different tools and more what

00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,680
is

00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,680
open source and after the first event

00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:15,280
people started to get together

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:17,520
so over um more than uh like 11

00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,359
years we we join the events every year

00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,520
and when people meet people get together

00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:23,520
so their new idea coming

00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,800
so over the years of false asia was not

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,480
an event anymore

00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,640
uh during the event people exchanged

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,280
ideas they developed new projects so we

00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,400
now

00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,160
um hosted um a lot of uh

00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,680
open source project on our first asia

00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,640
github we have

00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,839
about um four thousand contributors in

00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,640
in our organization

00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,839
a network of thirty thousand people even

00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,560
though from the beginning it was only

00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:48,640
two people so we developed a various um

00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,400
open source software we have event

00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,880
management we have um

00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,680
source engine we also look into ai

00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,599
technology

00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,920
and i mentioned in the beginning we

00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:01,359
developed an open source hardware um

00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,280
product which is the pocket scion lab

00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:06,400
that enable um

00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:09,920
a student to learn electronics in a more

00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:12,480
um interesting and portable way

00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,000
yeah uh challenge so that was the

00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,359
journey i am not going to spend so much

00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,960
time talking about

00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,560
how we're getting here today but what

00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,280
i'm want to say is

00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,920
a lot of uh challenging challenges that

00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,880
we face

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,800
along the way that um one thing that

00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,119
help us to continue that if you believe

00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,599
in something continue doing something

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,319
like you you persist with your idea um

00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,800
no matter is it difficult challenging uh

00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,200
we

00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,920
we will still try to connect with people

00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,200
and try to make

00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,400
um try to make things happen uh one of

00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,560
the biggest

00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,599
biggest challenges across asia and i

00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,280
think with many

00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:50,640
other open source projects and

00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:53,040
communities as well is the resources

00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,880
um we do not have a big company who who

00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,920
backing us right sustainability is

00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,520
always a big issue

00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,839
how can you manage to continue to

00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,280
develop the projects and

00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:03,200
also the question of getting

00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:06,000
contributors on on board

00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,800
um and i already mentioned earlier about

00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,960
like how to

00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,400
to try to engage different people you

00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,119
need to speak their language you need to

00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,599
be open

00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:15,280
and and and embrace diversity and it's

00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:18,480
also very similar to

00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:21,760
um due to the first asia community and

00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,119
i think um lorena mentioned uh in

00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,119
in africa people have different

00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,480
motivation why they get engaged into the

00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,920
open source community

00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,680
it's also similar to uh to to asia what

00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,240
what are people motivation we need to

00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,960
understand to be more people motivation

00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:39,280
and so when you come to developing

00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,000
country all you want is to do to have us

00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,760
a stable

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,599
life to take care of your family we

00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,240
don't have a healthcare system here

00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:48,319
um like in germany's or everywhere so we

00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,240
need to understand what people need

00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:52,400
and show them the opportunity they can

00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,040
get with with open source

00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,880
um building the trust in the community

00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:59,920
so this is something that we uh

00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,480
believe that will um that works over the

00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,520
year

00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,520
and enable people to um to do more

00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,680
things enable people to be independent

00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,680
enable people to build skill that can

00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,359
that they can market themselves in the

00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,599
job market enable them

00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:15,440
to earn a living to sustain their life

00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,839
so that they can continue to contribute

00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,920
to

00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,680
to open source and we need to be

00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,079
prepared that people will leave at one

00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:24,720
point so how you can get new generation

00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,760
to contribute is about what uh manuel

00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,880
mentioned earlier

00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,119
uh the education so what university was

00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,280
for several years uh for asia connect

00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,920
with university in vietnam university in

00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,839
singapore

00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,200
india we have several workshops in the

00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:40,880
across india

00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,880
we have um hakatons also in india and

00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,640
china we work together with qinghua

00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,200
university in china

00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,839
so it's really important to work with

00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,119
the local

00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:52,960
institutions and i just want to add one

00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:56,160
more point if you are thinking of

00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:58,319
studying a community and i want to

00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,280
to to reference what thomas said as

00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:01,040
earlier

00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,960
don't just start a community think of

00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,720
what is your goal maybe it can be

00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,640
achieved already by

00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,720
being part of the existing community

00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:12,079
it's not an easy task to do

00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,920
so uh if you want to foster um

00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,359
some there's so many projects out there

00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,440
that you can contribute to

00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:19,040
if you really have a specific goal that

00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,280
you want to achieve and no other

00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,760
existing communities can satisfy that

00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,319
goal

00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,440
then think of uh like to trust something

00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:28,240
but it's not an

00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,839
easy start starting something easy but

00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:33,359
manage how to sustain is really

00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:34,160
difficult yeah and i think that there

00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,800
are a lot of

00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,960
also a good example if you want to to

00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,680
look at so um here we met like a lot of

00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,319
people mention

00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,680
uh the gnome foundation as an

00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:46,480
organization in asia

00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:48,240
like us we also be able to succeed for

00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,400
several years and continue to grow we

00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,040
have our best practices available on the

00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,200
blog

00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:55,599
on the website and we always are happy

00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,640
to to exchange and share more

00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:02,240
ideas so our members are active also on

00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:05,040
on github if you want to to find it

00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,760
yes thank you maybe you can share any of

00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,920
those links

00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,160
in the chat or even the shared notes

00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:13,359
that would be very helpful

00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,839
um regina would you like to answer the

00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:15,839
current question

00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:20,880
how did you start your community what

00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:24,160
were some challenges you faced

00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,560
and what some advice you would give yeah

00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,520
sure

00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,079
i think it's quite exciting to listen to

00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,680
everyone

00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:33,359
and they've been quite a number of good

00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,359
points that we made

00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:38,400
so actually the grammar figure started

00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:41,520
uh 2019 basically

00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,160
i started when i joined the dignum

00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,520
foundation

00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:49,040
i had been lecturing um linux

00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,520
for over seven years uh before joining

00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,800
um

00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:55,599
the gnome foundation so i was uh already

00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:58,079
you know i understood the linux so

00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,800
finding people that have the same

00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:02,160
um i worked on the same platform that

00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,599
i've been you know using to teach for a

00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:06,160
very long time was quite

00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:08,079
exciting for me but then i realized that

00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,319
when i came in i was only introduced i

00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:12,079
think about two africans uh which we

00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:15,599
basically did not

00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:19,359
at the time uh um was not

00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:22,720
a very um good uh introduction for me um

00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:24,720
in a sense that were a few and i wanted

00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,079
them to have more africans into the

00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,000
gnome foundation

00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,880
uh because i know it would you know not

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,960
just for diversity sake uh but also to

00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,040
you know bringing you know diverse ideas

00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,559
um into the community and so that's why

00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:39,680
that's what actually formed

00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:40,800
the gnome africa community and so at the

00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,359
time we started

00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,119
i think we started first day i i spoke

00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:48,000
about the gnome desktop

00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,720
in an event and i was quite um excited

00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,400
to see

00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:54,640
the um interest people add um for the

00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,640
gnome desktop and you know i just did

00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,920
basically something like a practical

00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,800
um workshop um in the event and i showed

00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,480
people how

00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,880
it was easy to work with the gnome um

00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:08,079
desktop i'm on the linux um

00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:11,200
um on the linux uh

00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:13,520
um platform basically and

00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,559
we know we got a lot of people that was

00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,480
interested um

00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,920
to want to be part of the gnome uh

00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,160
foundation and i think that basically

00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,319
was started the new africa community

00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,599
and so at the beginning we had people of

00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:25,359
interest

00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,839
that came in but then we had people of

00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:30,240
interest with no with less

00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:31,599
idea about what open sources in general

00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,240
and about basically

00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,040
what gnome is and what gnome foundation

00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:38,160
is

00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:40,800
so for for us at the time it was uh

00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,640
more of introducing people to open cells

00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,480
introducing people to work nominees

00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:47,200
and i would say first that the community

00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:49,119
is being very clear and direct about the

00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,480
roadmap of the community you're trying

00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,000
to build

00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,079
and the way the community you're trying

00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,119
to create is going to

00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,960
so um glom africa is definitely uh a

00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:00,880
branch of the globe foundation

00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,559
so we we ensured that we were clear

00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,599
enough about the goals of gloam

00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,040
foundation

00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,119
and what green africa is doing is

00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,839
basically extending

00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,400
the community into you know into africa

00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:13,119
but

00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,640
we are all achieving the same goal so we

00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:15,680
were always you know having to tell

00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,839
you know people who are coming to the

00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,040
community um your contribution

00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:19,680
contributions to open source you know

00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:23,599
basically

00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:25,200
it's a contribution on the ground um

00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,640
maintaining ground projects and global

00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,920
open source software's that's basically

00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:31,119
what it was

00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:34,319
but then um um another thing is um

00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:36,319
we um had people um

00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:37,680
we took people the way they they have so

00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,800
basically if you if you're not in

00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,559
technology for example

00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,400
you're not a computer science person and

00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,160
you just have interests um

00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,000
in open source we we're you know we're

00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,440
open to helping you grow

00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,440
and basically telling you what the

00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,960
community is about so so let me iterate

00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,839
by saying that

00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,800
um the the foundation community you

00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:56,720
would know

00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,880
um i've not really had much faith in

00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:01,520
africa you know from onset

00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,160
so we had so many things to do as to you

00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,200
know

00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,920
having people to feel part of the

00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,920
community and

00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:12,640
you know feel um kind of kind of um

00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,319
comfortable accepted acceptance

00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:17,520
basically in the community

00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:18,559
uh so um what we did again uh basically

00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:22,160
was to always show

00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:23,599
people um appreciation for the little

00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,839
and for every contribution that they

00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,720
make um so we used mostar social media

00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:28,720
platform

00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,480
as a means to you know call out the

00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,119
names of those that you know that helped

00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,520
us

00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,119
um to maybe social media or contributed

00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,000
to the globe foundation project one way

00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,640
or the other

00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,160
that allowed people to stay more in the

00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,920
community you know and

00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:44,160
has been able to create a kind of a

00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,280
level of um sustainability for the

00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,280
community

00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,559
um what is the challenge is basically i

00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,720
would say is

00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,400
motivation in africa is different from

00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,359
every part of the world i i think we

00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,119
should say that

00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:56,480
and so if you need people to come to to

00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:56,800
contribute to open cells people have

00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,839
real

00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,240
issue real problems uh so you need to

00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:01,760
look at

00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,440
projects basically that are going to

00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,760
help people um

00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,720
compensate them for their contribution

00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,280
and so

00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,880
that's for i think to some time slowed

00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:14,000
us down a little bit

00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:16,319
um so because uh we needed to do

00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,760
begin to do stuffs that um begin to do

00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,880
the project something like our teaching

00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,680
you know something that would help

00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,440
people

00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,640
you know gain the type of motivation

00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,920
they need that would help them go

00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,920
through the normal life and

00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,040
pay bills at the same time contribute to

00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:31,440
open source

00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:32,960
so right now um we are launching into

00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,880
universities in africa we just started

00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,800
the application process basically

00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,480
and we're quite excited at the numbers

00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,839
of people that are willing to be

00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,160
ambassadors for grown

00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:44,000
indian universities um and we're looking

00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,240
to work out a way that would you know

00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,280
you know have to you know create a

00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,880
platform where they would

00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,800
understand what the gnome foundation is

00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:53,680
so again for us basically

00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:55,200
in the community is more of continuing

00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:57,520
to show people

00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,319
the roadmap to the community how do you

00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,480
join

00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:02,160
how do you contribute what is the

00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,599
benefit of your contributions

00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:06,160
what are the different aspects you can

00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:07,440
contribute to it's maybe code it may be

00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,440
translation

00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,200
you know we just always have to do this

00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,400
over and over again to let people know

00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,559
and it might never be

00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,319
because you're just starting um it might

00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:21,200
never be enough at the moment we have to

00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:23,200
keep doing this um as regards to um

00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,040
another thing i think that we did last

00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,960
year that happened well

00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,800
um although i don't have a i don't have

00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,440
like a full update on that but i can

00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:33,119
talk about

00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:36,160
what um the scalable onboarding project

00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:37,599
basically started by three uh and some

00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:40,240
other members um

00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:40,800
inclusive me uh but i've not really been

00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,480
um

00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,359
there for for quite some time since i

00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:48,240
relocated so basically it's like uh

00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:49,119
you know creating a kind of a a platform

00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,359
a

00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,160
metrics that helps people to basically

00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,760
on board

00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:56,000
newcomers to onboard you know properly

00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:59,200
into the uh not just gnome

00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,839
as a but basically open source projects

00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:03,680
and this is a there's another way to

00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:05,280
kind of help new people newcomers

00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:08,400
basically to come into the you know

00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,920
open source community uh so another

00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,720
thing that is very important that i'm

00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,280
you know quite

00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,880
um let me just we're passionate about

00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,359
the sustainability of

00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,880
the project basically and how well the

00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:21,920
project can scale

00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:24,720
um above correct members

00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,760
to um you know new contributors that are

00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,720
coming up

00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:30,480
so um one of the the initiative um that

00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,160
we're driving again it's the university

00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,920
mission which basically what one way we

00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,359
can scale easily in africa

00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,960
and we can you know bring sustainability

00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:40,319
into the project and have more

00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:43,599
newer people join um the community

00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:45,920
so with that be uh we do we have

00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,280
challenges at the moment or yes we we

00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,119
have we have quite a number of times

00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,480
i've mentioned a few

00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:52,319
and that's basically coming up with

00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,480
projects we hope that we

00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:56,319
there will be more project like outreach

00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,640
where people can actually get you know

00:53:56,319 --> 00:54:00,400
um compensations um for open source

00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,839
contributions and in a more project like

00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,440
manual sales like the

00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:05,520
education project they will ignore which

00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,200
is basically a very good project

00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,040
but so we need more of those type of

00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,640
projects basically um

00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,559
know opens us to help you know people

00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:15,599
from diverse or um you know

00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:18,480
communicators join the open source and

00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:19,520
you know we get more um diverse ideas

00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,440
from that part

00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:25,680
another another um another

00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,520
challenge we are having is basically

00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:30,800
having to

00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,839
um again um talk more and build a

00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,640
platform for open

00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:36,240
for um the how people can understand

00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,400
what gnome is about the students

00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,839
documentation and all of that so what we

00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,599
are doing in global africa at the moment

00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:43,200
is to try to create a platform

00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:45,280
more like a platform for global africa

00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:48,240
where we have like a very very

00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:50,240
um vigils and pictures and pictorial

00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,440
sequence of how the gnome africa was

00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,520
created

00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,559
and the the contributions that different

00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:57,599
people from africa

00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:59,440
is making at the moment and um you know

00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:01,760
have that documented in a way that

00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,000
when a new african comes into community

00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:06,160
we can tilt them to

00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,599
the platform and they could see the road

00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,119
maps and to be easy for them to

00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:13,040
basically come to come because

00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:16,079
like um i think uh manual mentioned um

00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:17,520
gum foundation is big and key is big and

00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:20,880
so that there are

00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:24,720
quite a whole lot of um

00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:26,480
um projects that can be contributed to

00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,079
and sometimes one can get lost in the

00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,520
old road map and you know not knowing

00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:31,040
basically where to start and all of that

00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:33,280
so we're trying to

00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,079
make sure that um for the grammatical

00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,760
community

00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,599
we create a platform that allows people

00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,480
to easily come in and they don't get

00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:40,880
lost in the

00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,319
in the crowd and they they know where to

00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:45,200
start and you know they know

00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:45,839
who to reach out to and who to speak to

00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,040
at any

00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:49,680
point in time so i think that's

00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:53,119
basically where we are at the moment

00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:55,040
uh with um the issue with sustainability

00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:57,040
so i think overall in general is

00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:59,760
basically ensuring that

00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,480
you know we're making projects um that

00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,319
you know

00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,160
creates you know conversation ensuring

00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:04,960
that we are building type of projects

00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:08,559
that allows

00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:11,040
people um to scale you know outside

00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:11,839
um the users i mean the people that

00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,079
started the

00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:15,599
the foundation the community two newer

00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,240
people taking up challenges and all of

00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,440
that so

00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,359
these are basically what we are doing at

00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,400
the time we're doing that early um

00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:21,520
because we want to create the right

00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:25,920
foundation

00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:25,920
um for um diplomatic recommendation

00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:33,200
right thank you well

00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:34,240
uh mustafa let's see if we can get a

00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:37,359
little bit from you

00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:39,200
um let us know where your base uh which

00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:40,559
organization and projects you're

00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:45,839
affiliated with and

00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:45,839
and how did you start your community

00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:58,880
i see your mic is on and see we might

00:56:53,760 --> 00:57:02,640
not have much stuff in here anymore

00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:04,720
okay unfortunately it looks like you did

00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:07,440
drop the call again

00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,160
i'd like to then introduce our next

00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,680
question

00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:13,440
being where are there opportunities for

00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:17,440
all of us to collaborate

00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:19,760
and increase users and revenue for linux

00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,760
apps

00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:27,359
i think as a foster community we are

00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:29,440
already collaborating really well

00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:31,359
but i feel that you know among us we

00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:34,640
should not have any competition

00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:37,760
it's not the real stats but i'm just

00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:39,520
saying uh assume stats that the market

00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,400
share which proprietary

00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:44,079
softwares have is approximately 95 and

00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,520
we might have only five percent

00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:47,280
so i think rather than you know

00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:49,359
competing for five percent we should all

00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:51,440
compete for the 95 percent

00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:53,440
and we should support each other i feel

00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:56,559
in this journey

00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:58,400
and uh for the today i think for revenue

00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:00,319
we can always do that rather than having

00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,640
a plain page of donations

00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:04,000
we create a small donation pages for

00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,559
example you know

00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,079
i worked my previous uh background has

00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:10,160
been that i have worked for a lot of

00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:12,079
not-for-profit organizations so what

00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,720
they used to do was they had emotional

00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:14,559
impact

00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,079
so maybe you know creating a page where

00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:17,280
you can say that you donate for an

00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:20,000
educational app

00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:21,440
that is creating impact in a government

00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,400
school for example right now we are

00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,240
working with

00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,160
public schools in kerala and you have

00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:28,319
the stats that how poor they are

00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,280
so using those stats actually for more

00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:31,119
donations

00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,440
on your page can help you to increase

00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:34,720
revenue because we are not selling we

00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,160
are not we do not have

00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,319
advertisements we are not selling the

00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,760
data so we don't have any other way to

00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:41,599
actually earn the money

00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,760
this is the only way we can actually you

00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:46,240
know earn more donations and

00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,799
uh we need to create this the impact

00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,880
that

00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:50,160
no donation is a small donation maybe

00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,319
you know a lot of people think that

00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:54,160
i'm not a big company even individual

00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:55,280
donations are appreciated and we should

00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,920
you know somehow

00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,880
change our page and we should say that

00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,480
the individual

00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,480
these are the numbers of the individual

00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,319
contributors

00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:07,520
i think i've covered the points but if i

00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:08,960
missed anything let me know alison

00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:10,559
yeah so i don't want to say that i'd

00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:13,280
really like to point any um

00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:14,319
any convention about competition inside

00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,720
the community

00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:18,319
so rather compete among each other work

00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,240
support each other and i think the the

00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:22,559
most practical way how we can support

00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,160
each other is use each other product

00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,920
so if people in the open source

00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:28,240
community develop something

00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,520
use it and a lot of people go out there

00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,440
talk about open source but they don't

00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:33,680
actually use open source themselves

00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,920
yeah so if i organize an event i have an

00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:38,160
option i would use an open source uh

00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,280
system so it's nice that we just use big

00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:42,319
blue button here to

00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:44,079
um to run this event so i also

00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:46,400
like use instead of using photoshop

00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:49,280
that's your game so how can we make sure

00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:51,760
that we use the uh

00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:54,240
application that developed by our inner

00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:57,520
circle rather than um

00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:59,520
a variety software if we have an option

00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,559
and another thing that i want to add

00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:03,839
here donation

01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:05,200
is one model of uh gending funding for

01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:08,319
open source project

01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,799
but this is not the only model yeah and

01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:11,599
also

01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:12,960
like community you also don't mention

01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:15,839
about compensation

01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,160
uh conversation to uh to the developers

01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:19,119
so

01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,920
uh not everyone can afford to join uh to

01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:22,079
come company

01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,760
can come and say the developer or not

01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:24,640
all the projects will be accepted into

01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,839
our regi

01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:29,640
so we need to constantly think of

01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:31,760
different um

01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:33,119
commercialization model how people can

01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:36,400
earn an income

01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:38,160
there are a lot of research out there

01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,200
that showing people can earn money by

01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:41,440
offer support

01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,400
around open source application so what

01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:45,920
we are missing

01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:48,400
in the ecosystem we develop on

01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,440
a software application a lot of people

01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,839
developers

01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:54,160
like thomas okay like to write code you

01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:56,799
spend a lot of time on make the

01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:59,040
super super nice application a lot of

01:00:56,799 --> 01:01:01,119
things related to very technical topic

01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:03,359
but one thing that we often missing is

01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:05,280
how to enable the user

01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:07,280
yeah and a lot of so when you try to

01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:09,280
convince a company to use an open source

01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,079
application they often ask for or do you

01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,799
have

01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:13,520
um offer to support the companies on

01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:16,000
boarding them

01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,760
or any um and maintaining of the service

01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,839
administration of the service often open

01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:22,319
soft project do not have

01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:24,960
a model where they can offer support to

01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:26,960
uh to companies or to more like to

01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:30,799
government sector for instance

01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,440
so um so anyway what i try to say is

01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:33,280
that

01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,559
uh helping each other by using each

01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:37,520
other uh product

01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:38,240
in inside the community and think of a

01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:40,720
way to

01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:41,440
commercialize your project offering

01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:44,960
support

01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:45,680
or or sell on the software as a service

01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,839
of course

01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:49,520
it's not so easy but we certainly need

01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:52,799
to think of a way how to

01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:56,240
um earn an income and also how to

01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:58,799
to to to to pay our developers

01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,280
uh at the foundation for example we we

01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:01,280
also

01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:03,440
constantly think of different models how

01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:06,559
to we can get the funding

01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:07,359
rather than depending on donation and we

01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:09,760
distribute

01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:10,400
uh um hardware over so the hardware that

01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,839
we

01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,760
produce completely open source but

01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:17,119
people do like buy the

01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:20,400
the hardware online uh to to

01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:22,079
to help the the project to sustain and

01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,680
one thing that i also feel a little bit

01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:25,839
sad so for instance

01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:28,160
even we understand how difficult it is

01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:29,839
to succeed in open source uh

01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:33,440
community a lot of us still really

01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:35,920
hesitate to pay for open source

01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:37,039
product so uh people would okay so into

01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,880
the privacy uh

01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:41,359
software uh by default we have today but

01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:44,000
why do we have to pay for open source

01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:49,200
um and i think this is the mindset that

01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:53,280
uh that we need to change

01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:55,599
that's fantastic and i love how

01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,680
both you and anika kind of agreed and

01:02:55,599 --> 01:03:00,799
expanded on each other's points

01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:04,400
um manuel please

01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:07,920
please go ahead this already

01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:11,200
talking about congress is

01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:13,359
is amazing here in mexico we are working

01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:16,960
to create new new companies a little

01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:20,000
companies of technologies and innovation

01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:22,960
projects of innovation with technologies

01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,599
focus it with philosophy open source

01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:27,520
right now

01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:29,039
we have maybe a 15 15 new companies a

01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:32,000
little companies

01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:34,240
created by the students which works at

01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,680
the open source lab community

01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:40,160
and right now is a

01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:41,440
selling or getting getting paid and

01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:44,799
getting paid

01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:47,839
for the your your knowledge uh

01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:49,920
the mindset the the the the basic

01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:52,079
mindset is to change

01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:53,280
the way to see the projects with open

01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:56,799
source projects

01:03:53,280 --> 01:04:00,160
because we are we like uh

01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:04,240
open source technology users

01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:07,440
development developers we don't

01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:09,680
we can see the projects like a products

01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:10,720
we must to see the projects like

01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:14,799
services

01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:18,000
and we must we must to to get him

01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:21,440
to making boys to get money from

01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:23,039
uh or knowledge i think the

01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,559
the open source is a very good

01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:27,359
opportunity to create a new

01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:28,480
new business model to work to create a

01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:31,680
new company's

01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:34,720
a new economic model to to estrange

01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:38,400
the actual model

01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:40,799
economic model around the the companies

01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,520
specializes in technologies so it's a

01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:44,559
very

01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:45,599
is it's very important to take the young

01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:49,039
stalins

01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:52,559
and to take to the

01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:55,599
new new companies and to get

01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:56,000
all the talent uh to create new model

01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:57,359
new

01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,680
business model around open source

01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:02,720
technologies so this i i

01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:05,839
totally agree with with honk and we

01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:08,400
we march we must to to

01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:09,200
approach to the new talent to get the

01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:12,799
content the

01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:15,359
the truth to create our own companies

01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:18,000
i think is the the the main the main way

01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:21,200
here at zacatecas here at mexico we have

01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,330
all the support from government but we

01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,880
we don't we don't

01:05:23,330 --> 01:05:27,920
[Music]

01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:31,200
we don't have uh thinking only is the

01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:34,799
the only way to to support or to

01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:36,400
finance or project we must to to try to

01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:39,440
create a new new way

01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:43,280
to strengthen this kind of models and

01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:45,119
the new new economic model new model of

01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,400
business with the open source is a very

01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:51,839
good opportunity for

01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:51,839
for for everyone thank you

01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:56,400
thank you so much would you like to take

01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:56,400
it from here

01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:04,880
i mean the things that i would say or it

01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:07,760
would be a little bit repetitive because

01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:09,760
i went too fast on my first

01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:12,079
iteration and i think i already said

01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:14,400
this but i would

01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:17,839
completely agree with everything that

01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:20,160

questions and our shared notes because i

01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:31,679
think those

01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:32,080
uh are very much worth asking uh because

01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:34,400
we

01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:36,319
we do have about 10 minutes remaining

01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:38,719
regina would you like

01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:40,319
to add any additional comments to our

01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:43,440
question being

01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:44,640
where are there opportunities for all of

01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:46,560
us to collaborate

01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:48,159
and increase users and revenue for linux

01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:52,159
apps keeping in mind

01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:52,159
we do only have about 10 minutes

01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:07,360
okay that's okay thank you

01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:08,480
yeah i do have one application that is

01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:11,360
trying currently

01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:11,920
to join a broader community name is

01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:15,280
wired

01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:17,280
panda this application was started by a

01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:20,159
professor doing his master's

01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:21,760
on university in brazil the problem is

01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:24,000
that the application is actually

01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,120
awesome and he does not know what to do

01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,159
with the awesomeness that the

01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:30,000
application is

01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:33,920
so i'm gonna try to write here them

01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,920
try to remember the name of the website

01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:40,800
and i am just pasting this here on the

01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:43,280
chat here is wiredpanda.org

01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:45,040
we are looking for people right now for

01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:47,679
universities to adopt

01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:49,600
the software and make it grow because

01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:52,640
this is an awesome software to

01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:56,800
teach about you know

01:10:52,640 --> 01:11:00,320
wires and logic circuits

01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:05,280
and we are trying to create a little bit

01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:08,480
of network around this application

01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:10,840
fantastic okay let's

01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:13,040
let's go to our questions from our

01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:15,440
audience

01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:16,719
first question is what do you think what

01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:20,239
do the panel think

01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:23,760
about creating or joining a

01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:26,560
is lug log i'm sorry don't know how i'm

01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:29,600
supposed to pronounce this one

01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:32,400
i guess is it the lino you sell group or

01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:34,320
on online i'm assuming yes linux users

01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,360
group and thank you for whoever just

01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:37,120
typed it in

01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:39,440
so i think the first thing would be to

01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:40,080
do not use appreciation because people

01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:42,400
from different

01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:43,120
regions might not understand what we

01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,719
mean

01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:46,560
so i think that we should always spell

01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:47,920
out the

01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,320
word that's this is the first thing we

01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,320
should do

01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:54,000
and uh to answer to that should i just

01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,840
go ahead um

01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,199
yeah okay so what do you think about

01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,440
creating what's running so

01:11:57,199 --> 01:12:00,239
uh i would be i will highly recommended

01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,400
it so

01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:04,239
uh a few years back whenever i travel to

01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:06,400
a new city the first thing i would look

01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:09,760
is look for the linux user room

01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:10,719
in the i remember one time i traveled to

01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:13,199
um

01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:15,280
johannesburg in in south africa so i

01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:18,640
contacted someone in the linux user room

01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:20,320
i i i met him and later on he came to

01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:22,080
the position somewhere in singapore and

01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,760
we have the connection there and

01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:25,840
if you reach out to people and say that

01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,960
you come from similar background they

01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:29,840
always welcome you

01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:31,760
and when i first learned about um on

01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:33,679
open source it also comes from the linux

01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,360
user group in my university where people

01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:38,880
help me to install

01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:41,840
ubuntu for the first time in my machine

01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:42,719
and unfortunately it was very popular a

01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:46,480
few years

01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:49,600
back and it's coming from here so um

01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:51,520
you can call some it's a phone

01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:54,400
it's background for me i'm in a very

01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:57,120
quiet room a few years back right linux

01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,679
you saw ripper very popular but but not

01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,920
so much

01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:01,760
uh recently because uh there's so many

01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:04,159
new technologies so people really use

01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,920
the roof around certain technology and

01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:07,679
not so big about linux user group in

01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:10,159
general anymore but more on the

01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:13,520
distribution level for instance you see

01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:15,440
uh ubuntu um user group also like very

01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:17,520
popular everywhere so it's more

01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:18,800
if not like before in the beginning i i

01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:21,440
remember like 15

01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:23,040
um 12 15 years ago it's always about the

01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,239
first thing the first contact would be

01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:27,520
the linear user group

01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:29,600
in a different city but now that

01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:31,199
generation they're getting older so and

01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:34,320
they're not so

01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:36,560
in and also um like

01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:37,600
how to say active anymore but younger

01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:40,560
communication

01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:41,440
who form around specific technology

01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,360
specific

01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:45,920
linux distribution have become more

01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:46,400
popular and i also want to mention here

01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:49,760
i see

01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:52,000
in the core is which is a very

01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,800
um active so he also one of the core

01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,239
members of the

01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:57,840
ubuntu user group in south korea uh i'm

01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:59,520
very glad that i see him here you know

01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,280
the south korea is the

01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,800
the city normally we don't know so much

01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:05,679
about what's going on there

01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,320
but they're very active in in many ways

01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:08,239
and

01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:10,000
to answer this question yes think about

01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:10,719
uh joining i don't know if it's now

01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,120
still the

01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:14,400
uh the trend to create a new user link

01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:16,159
user group anymore

01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:18,080
but there's so many other if you are

01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:19,920
interested in one distribution go

01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:21,920
find the user group for their

01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,199
distribution or for certain technology

01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:26,880
and join them

01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:29,679
highly recommended okay yeah

01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:30,719
so i think that's the first question

01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:33,120
yeah

01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:35,360
uh just opening it up does anyone else

01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:37,520
want to add

01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:38,719
if not having to move on to the next

01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:41,760
question we have

01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:44,080
a couple more second question

01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:45,440
says what do you think about using

01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:48,480
languages other than

01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:51,760
english in fast communities

01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:53,360
for user support development and other

01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:56,400
purposes

01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:58,880
this uh oscar says

01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:01,120
i have encouraged this but ironically

01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:06,400
got pushback from peoples

01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:06,400
whose native language is not english

01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:15,679
um i would like to answer that question

01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:17,280
but we started in india and kerala has

01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:18,960
their own state language which is which

01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:20,560
is malayalam

01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:22,960
so of course people do understand

01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:25,040
english over there but it was not easy

01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:26,719
so what we have done is that we have all

01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:28,320
the documents in english

01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:30,480
and we have asked the local translator

01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:32,000
to translate that

01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:33,840
similarly we are going to do the same

01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,960
thing for china as well we are going to

01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:37,280
ask the local

01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,000
people to accurately translate that for

01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:40,400
us in

01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,239
chinese so you have to as i said before

01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:44,480
that you have to speak the language

01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:45,360
that's the only solution because you

01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:48,000
just have to

01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:49,440
spread the awareness about linux you

01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,199
don't have to

01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:53,840
uh force them to actually understand

01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:53,840
english

01:15:55,760 --> 01:16:03,360
thank you nika would anyone else like to

01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:07,120
to add anything to to anika's statement

01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:11,600
and again she was mentioning how

01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:14,800
we have to adapt to the local language

01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:18,239
so yeah brazil has a

01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:20,080
really low entry on english

01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:21,600
most of brazilians they don't understand

01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:24,640
english even when they

01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:26,159
are taught english the english is really

01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:29,280
basic

01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:31,920
one thing that i'm doing on the

01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:33,360
kd brazil community we are translating

01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:36,560
everything

01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:40,159
we are doing everything in portuguese

01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:43,199
and i am also in contact with the

01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:44,080
um future english teachers that are open

01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:46,320
source users

01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:48,400
and they are doing free lessons for a

01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:51,199
few of the members

01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:52,320
and we are fixing or improving software

01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:54,719
for them

01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:55,679
as a reward or something so we are

01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:59,199
trying to

01:16:55,679 --> 01:17:01,040
help each other out making uh

01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:03,040
one of those silly hollywood movies

01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,480
where one people helps another and then

01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:07,199
other helps another and then another

01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:07,199
help some other

01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:13,120
well thank you i'll keep myself brief

01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:15,120
there's a bunch of noise outside my

01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:16,880
window so i apologize

01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:20,480
would anyone else like to add maybe

01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:20,480
regina would you like to add anything

01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:31,840
you are needing to rejoin the audio

01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:38,960
yeah so while waiting for regina i can

01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,520
also

01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:43,199
mention that in the first asia community

01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:46,080
we organized several

01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:48,239
technical meeting in in hindi as we have

01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:50,719
a lot of contributors in

01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:53,040
in india when they work together i can

01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:55,679
see that they organize their their tech

01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:58,080
stand up and their regular technical

01:17:55,679 --> 01:18:01,360
alignment in in their local language so

01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:02,800
i think it's it's it's um also we

01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,880
encourage people to speak in their own

01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,760
language that definitely applause make

01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:08,640
people knew far

01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:10,000
more uh comfortable and one time one

01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:13,440
thing that i also learned from

01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,000
from yongbing um the um organizer from

01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,640
the

01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,199
boston group in in in south korea he

01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:20,080
also

01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:21,440
recommended us several times that

01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:23,760
instead of speaking

01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:25,360
to each other on the video call may be

01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:27,520
easier for people

01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:28,400
to type so even though it lasts an

01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:31,840
episode

01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:33,199
to type into sleek but some developers

01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:35,760
more comfortable with

01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:37,740
using writing writing english rather

01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:39,600
than speaking is also

01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:42,960
[Music]

01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:44,239
absolutely makes sense uh do you want to

01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:47,120
let us know

01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:48,719
how um english language is affected in

01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:51,120
african communities

01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:53,360
what are your thoughts on using

01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:55,840
languages other than english

01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:57,600
for user support development and other

01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:00,880
purposes

01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:04,560
uh can you hear me now excellent

01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:06,880
uh oh sorry i had issues with networks i

01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:10,320
was going back and forth

01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:12,480
okay uh i i think that it's a very good

01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:14,320
um this is my opinion now i think that

01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:18,000
is a very good um

01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:20,000
thing to have um other languages um

01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,760
translation basically in open source

01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,480
project excites me a lot

01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:26,159
basically if you have um translation of

01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:27,600
projects in different languages um

01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:31,040
basically not not african

01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:33,120
you know now but in other types of um

01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:35,199
languages and i think it helps to bring

01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:36,640
in onboard new contributors into open

01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:39,120
source projects um

01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:40,239
but in africa it's something that i uh i

01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,920
would love to see

01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:43,600
uh that we have different languages in

01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,640
africa um the gnome project has been

01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,840
translated in different

01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:48,400
languages in africa something i would

01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:50,560
love to see but yeah again it's uh

01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:51,440
like i said earlier when i was speaking

01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:53,360
one of the

01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:55,040
one of the things is basically road maps

01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:57,360
while these things have been done

01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:58,560
prior to now um which basically at the

01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:01,120
moment

01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:02,640
it's not so clear as to how translations

01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:05,520
of open source projects

01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:06,800
um uh are being done um i would i would

01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:09,360
love to see

01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:11,040
uh basically do uh a little bit of more

01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,679
research on open source projects and see

01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:14,480
how they've

01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:15,120
done well with translations and it will

01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:17,600
be you know

01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:18,880
very nice to invite that in the africa

01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,880
community in basically in the ground

01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,840
project as well since we basically are

01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:24,639
working

01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:25,440
to see that um there's more visibility

01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:27,199
for the

01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:32,320
gloom project so yeah i think it's a

01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:36,159
very good initiative

01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:38,400
thank you we are nearly out of time

01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:41,280
i would love to at least get the next

01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:44,639
question out in the world for everyone

01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:47,040
uh it is how is the open source software

01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:48,920
trying to call out for company so they

01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:52,159
are more attracted to use

01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:54,480
non-proprietary software also how is

01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:55,280
open source handling the demands that

01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:58,000
most

01:20:55,280 --> 01:21:00,000
of the proprietary software can handle

01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,560
many times we want to use open

01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,199
source software but they just can't keep

01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:05,040
up

01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:07,360
with the features of proprietary

01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:11,600
software therefore companies will pay

01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:11,600
for the proprietary software instead

01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:16,719
why the companies are not also paying

01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:17,600
for the open source software to develop

01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:19,840
themselves

01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:21,600
i mean if the only problem is money they

01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:25,199
can hire developers

01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:25,199
to do the job and improve

01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:33,120
yeah uh yes uh

01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:34,560
the answer is we cannot complete we just

01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,920
don't have enough money we are not

01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:38,480
google we are not

01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:40,320
microsoft how can we invest further into

01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:41,920
uh like all open source

01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:44,080
software but it doesn't mean that we

01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:45,840
don't have a way to succeed so earlier

01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:48,560
we mentioned about offer

01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:49,520
um support for open source uh rail open

01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:52,320
source software

01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:53,600
as a as a service to offer to companies

01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:56,159
so a lot of companies

01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:57,520
do not make a decision on using an open

01:21:56,159 --> 01:22:01,360
source because they have to said

01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:04,639
of the support um uh system do they get

01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:06,480
support to get a meditation service from

01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:08,320
open source application and another

01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:10,239
thing how we can encourage i think here

01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:12,159
in europe and it will be soon

01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:15,040
uh happening everywhere around the world

01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:17,840
like the legislation the government

01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:19,920
thanks to uh to embrace open source so

01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:23,120
if we have something coming from the

01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:26,800
uh the government level that encouraged

01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:28,560
um and find more like uh embrace open

01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:31,040
source more i think companies will also

01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:32,719
started to look into open source in

01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:35,520
europe there are a lot of uh

01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:36,159
funding for um for companies who want to

01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:38,239
develop

01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:39,760
develop or stack open source i'm also

01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:40,880
part of the open source business

01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:43,440
alliance europe

01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:45,199
so these are a network of open that of

01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:48,480
uh companies that are doing

01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:48,800
um that develop open source application

01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,280
or

01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:53,280
using open source i think we need more

01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:55,360
uh like this so companies get together

01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:56,880
and if it changed on the government

01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,800
level where more

01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:00,560
adoption of open source being embraced

01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:03,840
everywhere also change

01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:07,280
the um the ecosystem

01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:10,400
how many software but they can't keep up

01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:11,840
with him and yeah so i think i did watch

01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:15,040
a chapter

01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:16,480
yeah just one thing increasing on what

01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:18,400
han said

01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:20,480
those companies that they that do not

01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:23,280
work on open source they are

01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:25,199
also using open source a lot like

01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:27,120
reading a lot

01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:29,120
probably their web servers are running

01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:30,239
linux probably their web services are

01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:32,080
running php

01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:33,840
probably there is something on python

01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:35,920
involved the routers

01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:37,120
are running linux their phones are

01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:41,920
running a kernel

01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:44,000
on linux so yes they are using a lot

01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:45,600
but why they are not spending a little

01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,080
bit trying to improve

01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:49,679
free software does not just means that

01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:52,320
you can get it for free but

01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:52,800
people are working on that and people

01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:56,000
need

01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:57,199
to get paid to work on that on their not

01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,239
free time

01:23:57,199 --> 01:24:02,880
um i work in a company that

01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:03,679
luckily allows me to do open source for

01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:07,120
a living

01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:09,040
but when i'm not working on open source

01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:11,040
i'm also working for open source because

01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:12,639
for me it's fun but for a lot of people

01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:15,199
it's not fun

01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:17,840
and they can't stay on the computer on

01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:17,840
the weekends

01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:24,320
yeah yeah so i think it's more like a

01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:26,000
chicken and egg problem so in order to

01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:27,600
compete with the feature set of the

01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,280
proprietary old software we need to have

01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,960
to find the funding before we have the

01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:31,440
funding we need to get somebody to pay

01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,679
for

01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:35,040
for open source application and in order

01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:36,080
to get somebody to pay for open source

01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:37,600
information to

01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:40,000
we need to make sure that we offer the

01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:41,760
services we need to pay people so that

01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,800
we can offer the services around our

01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:46,400
software

01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:46,880
to do the business yeah but i think with

01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:49,120
the

01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:50,639
current development and of course um we

01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:52,800
did not have a chance to go to

01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:54,080
um another question when we discuss

01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:57,280
about how

01:24:54,080 --> 01:25:00,159
the pandemic influence

01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:02,239
the false ecosystem i think of course

01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:04,239
it's not good the pandemic but it also

01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:05,280
opened up a lot of opportunities where

01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:08,400
people see how

01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:11,120
important it is to be transparent

01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:13,280
to be a collaborator to be open to

01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:15,360
develop better solution altogether

01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:17,199
so i think this is the right time and is

01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:18,239
it also an opportunity for us we see a

01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:21,520
lot of

01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:24,080
open source um application in health

01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:25,120
like being developed during the pandemic

01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:28,480
and they're more

01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:31,199
in different in different industry yeah

01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:32,480
and i have a high hope and also very

01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:34,960
positive for the future

01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:37,520
of a false ecosystem even though it is

01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:37,520
challenging

01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:43,600
thank you okay well our next talk begins

01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:46,639
in 10 minutes

01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:49,199
there is only one more question left

01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:50,080
if if you all are happy to to give it a

01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:54,320
quick answer

01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:59,440
i'm happy to give us the time for it

01:25:54,320 --> 01:26:02,080
um so i'll take silence yes

01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:02,880
uh the final question from our audience

01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:05,840
is

01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:08,000
what success story can you share on a

01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:10,080
self-sustaining project

01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,960
that you have been involved with or

01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,960
influenced

01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:20,800
you see the link being put into the

01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:24,800
notes

01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:28,320
would you like to or hong tomaz regina

01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:30,080
i think both gnome and kd are a really

01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:31,040
good example of a self-sustainable

01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:34,080
software

01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:38,639
i mean genomics use it on

01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:41,040
really huge um linux installs from the

01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:42,960
red hots that it's a really expensive

01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:45,199
linux

01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:48,239
red hat is more expensive than windows

01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:50,560
server and let's use it there

01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:51,600
so just to show that free software does

01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:54,719
not mean that it's

01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:57,880
graphics and

01:26:54,719 --> 01:27:01,280
kd is up and running since

01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:03,440
96 97 i mean it's

01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:04,320
more than 25 years there is a lot of

01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:07,440
people that are

01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:10,320
working today on kd that

01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:11,600
could have been a kd's son if kd was a

01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:15,120
person

01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:17,360
and this is self-sustainable they are

01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:18,719
i think just should picture fail now

01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:21,840
even if they are

01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:25,040
not uh like a

01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:26,960
company that deals with currency

01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:30,480
they don't actually need currency to

01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:32,960
keep up but they do need a little bit of

01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:34,880
currency just to make people together

01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:37,440
once or twice a year

01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:40,719
because it's much better to work with

01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:40,719
your colleagues by your side

01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:43,760
um

01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:50,719
okay okay and so i also put in the two

01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:53,520
projects that i directly um

01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:55,280
involved uh it's under the first asia

01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:56,159
community so the first project is a

01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:58,239
hardware project

01:27:56,159 --> 01:27:59,199
pocket science lab so it's been

01:27:58,239 --> 01:28:01,920
developed for

01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:03,679
about four years now and being a success

01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:05,199
so we have different ways to to sustain

01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:05,920
the two projects so the pocket science

01:28:05,199 --> 01:28:08,960
lab

01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:11,520
we sustained this project uh drew like

01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,639
a different source of funding we worked

01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:15,679
together with the eu

01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:18,639
on the horizon 2020 and

01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:20,080
and we also get funding from uh from

01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:22,159
different programs where they

01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:24,960
where they have to grow the open source

01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:28,320
uh hardware um

01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:30,560
ecosystem and we also offer um

01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:32,400
like um the product so the board that we

01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:33,440
make we sell on different channels so

01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:36,800
distribution

01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:37,679
in china in in the us and europe

01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:40,960
everywhere so

01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:43,040
selling the device in so a way to to get

01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:44,800
an income to pay for the development so

01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:46,800
this is the first project

01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:49,199
a second project is an event management

01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:51,120
system eventually is also

01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:52,560
tightly open source and the model how we

01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:56,239
can sustain this

01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:58,239
event is to uh similar to uh due to

01:28:56,239 --> 01:28:59,920
event price or another commercial

01:28:58,239 --> 01:29:02,239
service so people pay

01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:03,840
um for open source community if you

01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:05,679
don't sell a ticket you you don't pay

01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:08,639
but if you want some kind of

01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:10,400
like commercial um sales and tickets so

01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:12,719
we just on commission

01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:14,800
like for a small commission when you

01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:18,239
earn an income and i think this is also

01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:20,960
uh um like open same model

01:29:18,239 --> 01:29:22,880
for for for many software yeah so so you

01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:23,440
pay when when you also get an income for

01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:26,320
your

01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:27,120
event these are the two projects and two

01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:30,159
different

01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:33,199
funding models that um i've been

01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:33,199
directly involved with

01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:38,480
let me let me just um add to that

01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:40,320
basically i i think just to um

01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:42,480
expand on the ground foundation project

01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:43,840
basically um

01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:45,920
looking at the globe foundation project

01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:48,400
when it started um um

01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:48,960
apart from it being um self sustained

01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,480
form

01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:52,239
you know funding that we get um

01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:54,159
basically you would see that the gnome

01:29:52,239 --> 01:29:56,880
foundation also have

01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:59,040
a way of creating them legacy programs

01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:01,520
basically that allows it to

01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:02,159
continue to um sustain itself for

01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,960
example

01:30:02,159 --> 01:30:06,000
um projects like um the altitude that

01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:08,159
came out from the ground

01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:10,000
and basically and now we are running the

01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:11,920
educational challenge as well

01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,800
and green foundation is basically still

01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:17,360
you know with looking at other ways to

01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:19,199
skill as well to you know to bring up

01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:22,719
sustainable projects so i think

01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:23,280
sustainability um um if we look at it in

01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:27,360
a more

01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:29,600
um diverse way it's um

01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:30,639
the project is not relying basically on

01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:33,040
what it has

01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:35,360
been fed with for over 20 years the

01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:35,920
project is expanding itself to other not

01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:38,960
other

01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:40,880
aspects of the world globally and you

01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:42,639
know and i think that's uh

01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:49,840
one of the exciting thing about the

01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:49,840
ground foundation project basically

01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:54,960
and what would you like to add anything

01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:59,040
yeah thank you alison

01:30:54,960 --> 01:31:02,400
i think i think the very important

01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:03,520
projects i i am user i am just i am

01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:07,360
using

01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:08,000
linux from 19 1996 with the first

01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:12,000
edition

01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:15,760
the first version of mandrake so

01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,960
uh i think absolutely i agree with

01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:20,400
thomas and

01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:23,600
katie was the first the first ui in

01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:26,719
the ue graphical interface

01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:30,320
for the linux but i

01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:32,639
i want to share i think

01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:34,080
in here in zacatecas around the

01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:37,840
offensive line

01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:40,000
we are we are getting the

01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:41,600
the trust from the government and right

01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,040
now at government of the state of

01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:47,520
zacatecas we

01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:50,320
we have maybe 10 10 biggest projects

01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:52,400
10 more important points for government

01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:53,040
which are developed and developed with

01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:55,840
the

01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:56,320
technology of open source technologies

01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:59,199
so

01:31:56,320 --> 01:32:01,199
i think it's a very proud for us because

01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:04,560
our projects

01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:05,679
which don't have the government don't

01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:09,760
have to

01:32:05,679 --> 01:32:13,679
to pay expensive expensive money

01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:14,480
because we are we are working from open

01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:17,520
source

01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:18,480
but the more important is our guys or

01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:21,840
students

01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:22,880
which develop this project is working

01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:26,719
for government

01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:28,960
like support like background technical

01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:31,040
background to this kind of project so

01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:32,400
it's very important because they go to

01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:34,800
the government

01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:37,440
and working for this specifically for

01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:37,440
this project

01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:41,280
together with this project are developed

01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:44,480
they

01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:47,040
are they are working to develop maybe

01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:47,679
five or six another projects for this

01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:50,639
this

01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:51,440
this instance from government so i think

01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:54,800
the the

01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:58,639
model open source lab may make

01:32:54,800 --> 01:33:02,000
may get the impact to the government

01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:05,199
right now we we was starting

01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:08,159
to try to adopt and to migrate

01:33:05,199 --> 01:33:08,800
to use open source at government but

01:33:08,159 --> 01:33:12,320
it's uh

01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,639
it's a youtube because it's very complex

01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:16,719
the

01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:19,760
the the market around uh open source

01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:22,560
around in technologies

01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:23,679
so but we are right now we have a

01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:26,560
government

01:33:23,679 --> 01:33:28,320
maybe 95 percent of the of our

01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:30,560
infrastructure of government

01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:31,360
are working with open source

01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:35,040
technologies

01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:37,199
and the i i am sure it's a very

01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:38,400
very good it's a very good impact it's a

01:33:37,199 --> 01:33:40,560
very good benefit

01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:41,760
for the government is very important for

01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:44,960
us so

01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:46,320
we are working we will work to to make

01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:49,760
more projects

01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:52,560
but in the same way we most

01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:53,600
works to create new companies with open

01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:56,880
source technologies

01:33:53,600 --> 01:34:01,280
with new italian italian talent with

01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:04,480
new uh entrepreneurs creating or

01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:07,600
these own companies i i think is that

01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:07,600
thank you thank you alison

01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:11,840
thank you all really a big round of

01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:14,159
applause for each and every

one of you today for for joining us and

01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:18,159
being a panelist here

01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:20,000
i i think your insights were absolutely

01:34:18,159 --> 01:34:21,199
wonderful and it was great to hear some

01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,719
background about your

01:34:21,199 --> 01:34:27,120
your respective communities um again

for our viewers we will get started with

01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:15,840
our second to last talk at las

01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:15,840
in just one minute so stay tuned

01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:10,000
hi richard welcome i'll just ask you to

01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:25,840
rejoin the audio

01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:25,840
before we get started

01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:39,840
richard you need to meet with johnny

01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:39,840
mike okay

01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:55,760
let's try to know

01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:55,760
yes go ahead

01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:07,840
and

01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:18,560
okay we are listening now mutual use

01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:23,600
please yes exactly

01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:28,800
excellent well hello everybody um my

01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:32,320
name is richard hughes

01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:34,800
i work for red hat um on

01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:37,119
emerging technologies and desktop staff

01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:39,600
and firmware stuff

01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:40,960
and i was asked by um siri and allison

01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,840
to give a talk about

01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:44,880
how to basically build an ecosystem um

01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:47,199
on the logic is

01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:48,480
that i've worked on this stuff for like

01:37:47,199 --> 01:37:50,320
five years now

01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:52,159
we've managed to get companies to care

01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:53,360
about linux users where perhaps they

01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:55,040
haven't in the past

01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:57,440
and there's an awful lot of overlap

01:37:55,040 --> 01:38:01,679
between a firmware ecosystem

01:37:57,440 --> 01:38:05,199
and an app ecosystem

01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:08,880
right let's do next slide so

01:38:05,199 --> 01:38:11,679
um the basic problem we're trying to

01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:13,920
solve five years ago um is that users

01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:15,679
just weren't updating firmware

01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:17,760
then there's not this thing anymore that

01:38:15,679 --> 01:38:19,600
is just a kind of like add support for

01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:21,199
new cpus and that kind of stuff

01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:23,119
it's actually security critical it's

01:38:21,199 --> 01:38:24,560
like an os underneath your os

01:38:23,119 --> 01:38:26,159
and so not updating firmware as a

01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:28,880
security um

01:38:26,159 --> 01:38:29,600
nightmare so the problems are four-fold

01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:31,199
people didn't know

01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:34,800
how hardware they had installed whether

01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:36,560
it was nvme drive an ata drive etc

01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:38,560
they didn't know updates were available

01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:40,159
so they didn't go to support.dell.com on

01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:43,040
a monthly basis and search for

01:38:40,159 --> 01:38:44,239
serial numbers and stuff and even if

01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:45,520
they could get hold of them

01:38:44,239 --> 01:38:47,280
a lot of defenders were supplying the

01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:50,400
files just from random

01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:52,480
well literally ftp sites with if you

01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:52,880
were lucky in md5 checks on without any

01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:55,360
kind of

01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:56,639
certificates or any sort of assurance

01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:58,880
that the firm hadn't been tampered with

01:38:56,639 --> 01:39:00,800
in some way

01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:01,920
and then even if you did manage to find

01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:03,520
the firmware

01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:05,440
um it might be that you were not allowed

01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:06,000
to apply it so every example here is i

01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:08,080
have a

01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,840
lg monitor i use and the only way you

01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:12,639
can play the firmware is using windows

01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:15,199
xp or windows 7 doesn't like windows 10

01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:16,800
or i have a blemish server which has x

01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:17,520
clarity on it and that only works in

01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:20,639
miles seven

01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:22,159
doesn't work in relay or roll nine

01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:24,159
so even if you manage to find the

01:39:22,159 --> 01:39:25,920
updates um

01:39:24,159 --> 01:39:27,440
and it might be that the vendor that you

01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:29,199
um bought the laptop from if you had

01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:30,480
bought the unifying receiver at the same

01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:32,080
time from the dell

01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:33,360
laptop it might be that you had to go to

01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:34,000
two different vendors to find the

01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:35,520
firmware

01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,880
and then it wouldn't apply anyway and so

01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:37,440
the consequence of this is people just

01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:40,159
weren't

01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:41,840
um doing firmware updates which is

01:39:40,159 --> 01:39:43,840
something that my boss said this needs

01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:46,239
fixing

01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:47,040
so what did we do um i bought two

01:39:46,239 --> 01:39:49,760
projects

01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:50,239
and the lpfs is essentially the web app

01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:52,400
um

01:39:50,239 --> 01:39:54,639
and it's basically the like the metadata

01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:57,520
source of both the firmware

01:39:54,639 --> 01:39:58,719
and the list of firmware um and the idea

01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,679
is the only people that you have to use

01:39:58,719 --> 01:40:03,679
the lvfs

01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:06,840
are the odms the oems that kind of thing

01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:08,080
um people like i don't know dell lenovo

01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:12,080
etc

01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:13,360
um and everyone else just downloads a

01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:15,840
shared metadata catalog

01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:17,119
uh all the different firmwares available

01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:18,480
and then the other side of the project

01:40:17,119 --> 01:40:19,600
is once you have all that high quality

01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:21,360
metadata

01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:22,719
you need to be able to apply onto your

01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:24,719
hardware so i guess

01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:26,080
in the same way you can relate this back

01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:28,480
down to like flat hub

01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:29,440
and the local like lip flap pack

01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:30,800
scenario

01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:32,960
where you need a mechanism to actually

01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:36,480
install the data onto your computer

01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:39,199
and so fwd is a a project that i think

01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:39,840
it's got about 33 34 different protocols

01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:41,280
now

01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:43,520
and there's another sort of five in

01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:45,280
development um

01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:46,639
where you can just take a blob of

01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:49,679
firmware and

01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:52,880
blitz it to an nvme or ata

01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:54,880
or um wacom or

01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:56,159
via all this there's dozens of different

01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:56,800
vendors that have all these different

01:40:56,159 --> 01:41:00,080
bespoke

01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:03,920
protocols and then i guess unlike

01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:05,360
maybe like how snap and flat pack work

01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:07,760
we kind of close the circle

01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:08,480
back so we have this idea of you report

01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:10,560
status

01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:12,159
optionally and it's completely opt-in

01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:13,600
where if the update went well

01:41:12,159 --> 01:41:16,400
um you might report the status back to

01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:19,760
the lbfs just with us or boolean success

01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:21,600
but if it failed for some reason um you

01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:23,760
get a lot of system debugging

01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:25,040
so if there was a substantial number of

01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:27,199
failures coming back for a certain

01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:30,560
firmware you can kind of work out that

01:41:27,199 --> 01:41:33,280
um the firmware's failing because um

01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:34,000
i don't know um the kernel version is

01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:35,760
too old

01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,119
and so there's some the the fix there

01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:38,159
would be to go back into the firmware on

01:41:37,119 --> 01:41:40,000
the rbfs

01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:41,360
and add an extra requirement to say the

01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:44,239
firmware must be at least this

01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:45,360
this new um otherwise don't suggest it

01:41:44,239 --> 01:41:47,280
and it's a really good way of kind of

01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:48,800
working out issues when we first started

01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:52,239
we had all these issues where

01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:55,280
i know like um debian had a really old

01:41:52,239 --> 01:41:57,199
usb lib usb version um which would

01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:58,639
trigger a bug which wasn't triggered in

01:41:57,199 --> 01:42:01,040
like all the things we're testing on

01:41:58,639 --> 01:42:03,119
like ubuntu fedora etcetera

01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:04,719
um it is really useful like i say it's

01:42:03,119 --> 01:42:05,199
completely opt-in um but it might be

01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:06,480
could

01:42:05,199 --> 01:42:08,159
close a second it also means i could

01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:09,520
sleep well at night because if a bad

01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:11,600
firmware goes out

01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:13,280
um it means that it's automatically

01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:15,360
demoted from the public

01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:16,639
to back to being private again if it

01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:17,119
fails more than a certain number of

01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:18,960
times

01:42:17,119 --> 01:42:20,560
so if it fails below so we've increased

01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:22,000
like one percent error rate or something

01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:25,600
it automatically gets

01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:28,800
demoted um back down so it's kind of a

01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:29,280
um a bit more exciting than maybe an ftp

01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:32,320
site

01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:34,239
would be so actually looking at the

01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:35,520
architecture this is i guess fairly

01:42:34,239 --> 01:42:37,920
similar actually what ftp

01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:39,600
what what f3d does is probably not super

01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:41,679
interesting for this audience

01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:43,119
um but it's essentially like what snap

01:42:41,679 --> 01:42:46,480
and flat pack or

01:42:43,119 --> 01:42:48,880
um package kit um are doing

01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:50,560
um essentially i have three layers um

01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:52,719
you have the internet layer but the rbfs

01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:56,800
is the kind of the download server

01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:58,480
and then you have this dumb cdn um

01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:00,080
the middle layer is a session which

01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:03,840
might be something like name software

01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:06,000
app um the kde software center

01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:07,760
um or even the command line after the

01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:09,040
mgr um

01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:10,880
all right one of the things that's

01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:12,000
interesting in this is we're analyzing

01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:13,920
the user agents that were actually

01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:16,480
requesting firmware

01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:17,440
99 of the downloads were being done

01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:20,000
using a gui

01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:21,440
line rather than one percent being done

01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:24,000
using command line which is a real

01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:25,600
surprise for firmware um

01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:28,800
so we have to make it beautiful and

01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:30,560
think about ux all the time

01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:33,280
now i put a new notes that optionally

01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:34,960
download metadata from the rvfs

01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:36,320
the idea here is you don't have to use

01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:39,520
the rbfs lots of

01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:41,040
companies um that don't use um

01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:42,800
uh like if you if you're efficient if

01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:44,000
you're a us agency

01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:45,920
none of your servers have internet

01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,760
access and so you might be getting the

01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:48,960
downloads the metadata and the firmware

01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:52,639
themselves

01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:55,760
from an nfs share or a samba

01:43:52,639 --> 01:43:58,000
share or something um and so it's not

01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:59,440
essential that you use the internet sort

01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:03,679
of side of things

01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:04,239
um the lowest bit the system service is

01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:06,560
ethically

01:44:04,239 --> 01:44:07,840
gr and that's basically enumerating so

01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:09,440
in the apple ecosystem you'll be saying

01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:11,679
what apps are already installed

01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:13,600
and actually lets you add and remove

01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:14,800
apps that are sort of specified from

01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:20,080
something like flat hub

01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:22,960
or firmware from lbfs

01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:24,400
so i guess the main comment here is

01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:25,600
people were asked all the time like why

01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:27,600
didn't i write this thing go

01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:29,280
why didn't i write this in rust and five

01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:29,600
years ago those ecosystems were even

01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:32,000
more

01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:33,280
immature than they are now um and the

01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,360
other thing is people who are actually

01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:37,360
writing the code to flash the firmware

01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:38,719
are probably firmware engineers and

01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:41,840
lingua franca in

01:44:38,719 --> 01:44:43,440
um firmware world is c

01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:45,040
so it was ridiculous to choose any other

01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:46,480
language that wasn't c if you're going

01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:48,400
to be asking people to contribute to

01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:49,600
your project who are potentially firmer

01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:52,239
engineers

01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:53,840
um of course c is kind of pretty clunky

01:44:52,239 --> 01:44:54,960
and it's not particularly nice to use

01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:57,920
without the sort of

01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:59,760
synthetic sugar of something like glib

01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:02,960
and using something like g object

01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:05,199
which is kind of a nice easy um sort of

01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:06,239
middle ground between not using c4 plus

01:45:05,199 --> 01:45:08,639
but still having

01:45:06,239 --> 01:45:10,080
um objects um oriented programming sort

01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:11,520
of um techniques

01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:13,040
um meant that we kind of had the best of

01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:14,560
both worlds where we could say to people

01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:16,400
this is how you use jiara and

01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:18,560
geo-objective stuff

01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:20,400
but also get the c programmers to

01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:22,000
contribute to our projects

01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:23,679
which all the comments is kind of

01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:26,719
important

01:45:23,679 --> 01:45:27,840
um yeah the other side of it was the

01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:31,119
website

01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:33,119
so i'm not a web

01:45:31,119 --> 01:45:34,480
developer and the idea of the rbfs right

01:45:33,119 --> 01:45:35,840
from the start was to be as simple as

01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:36,960
possible there was no i don't want to

01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:39,520
spend time

01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:41,199
building the stack i'm writing the stack

01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:43,520
um and astral

01:45:41,199 --> 01:45:44,800
i call it arch architecture astronauting

01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:47,679
where it's

01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:49,119
like you've specified this thing as a

01:45:47,679 --> 01:45:49,679
microservice architecture that can be

01:45:49,119 --> 01:45:52,400
run by

01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:54,159
a billion people or whatever the initial

01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:54,880
version the ivfs was just a website i

01:45:54,159 --> 01:45:56,400
think was

01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:58,320
even written in php or something was

01:45:56,400 --> 01:46:00,400
pretty pretty rubbish and

01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:02,400
you could just upload files which would

01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:05,520
be decompressed

01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:08,000
the metadata is all smashed together and

01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:09,440
that was basically it and then from that

01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,600
we kind of

01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:12,639
it organically grew to whatever we

01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:16,639
needed

01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:19,760
rather than trying to do everything um

01:46:16,639 --> 01:46:21,920
before i'm like it kind of works quite

01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:25,440
differently to microsoft update as well

01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:26,000
so i'm kind of keen on the privacy stuff

01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:27,679
here

01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:29,520
so the way windows update works is you

01:46:27,679 --> 01:46:30,880
have like a you do a request in it and

01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:32,400
you make all the hardware on your on

01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:34,000
your pc

01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:35,280
um and it sends all that information

01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,400
about your hardware and what firmware

01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:38,480
versions are installed

01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:40,080
up to one of the big servers in

01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:42,239
microsoft somewhere

01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:43,760
um on their banks and banks of servers

01:46:42,239 --> 01:46:45,119
processing these requests

01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:46,960
and then depending on the rule engine

01:46:45,119 --> 01:46:48,880
that's running on the servers it'll send

01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:50,480
you a bespoke reply back that says you

01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:52,639
need to install this update grab it from

01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:53,840
here

01:46:52,639 --> 01:46:55,679
that's great if you have banks of

01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:58,080
servers and you don't mind sending your

01:46:55,679 --> 01:47:00,560
hardware details to a third party

01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:02,080
but not something i wanted to do and so

01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:02,800
the way we did it we had everyone just

01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:04,560
downloading

01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:06,800
the shared metadata catalog so everyone

01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:09,920
downloads exactly the same file

01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:12,159
um from a dumb cdn so i could have

01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:14,480
made like 10 million people um a week

01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:16,400
with downloading this file initially

01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:17,520
and it was cost me 20 dollars because

01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:19,840
everyone's just downloading off this

01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:21,760
geo-replicated cdn

01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:23,040
it also meant i had no idea of what

01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:24,480
hardware people were running

01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:26,159
um because it was just everyone was

01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:26,560
requesting the same thing the only way

01:47:26,159 --> 01:47:28,560
you could

01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:29,760
find out is what thermo they were

01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:32,639
requesting that's kind of

01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:32,639
required anyway

01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:36,320
the flip side of that is we did a just

01:47:34,639 --> 01:47:37,920
we did a centralized

01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:39,440
firmware distribution so everyone

01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:41,119
downloaded the metadata but as soon as

01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:42,880
you wanted the firmware itself

01:47:41,119 --> 01:47:45,760
you had to download that from the rbfs

01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:47,840
now kind of the the textbook way

01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:49,280
the textbook reason for doing that is if

01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:50,880
there was a problem with the firmware or

01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:52,480
it needed to be signing

01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:54,400
or it was some sort of modification to

01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:56,239
it um we wouldn't have to like

01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:57,520
invalidate cdns around the world and we

01:47:56,239 --> 01:47:58,719
could pull it straight away with no

01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:01,360
delay

01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:02,000
but really it's statistics because if we

01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:05,199
go to

01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:06,239
a bigger oem and say something like hey

01:48:05,199 --> 01:48:09,600
there's um

01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:10,719
a lot of linux users who run lots of

01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:13,440
different computers

01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:15,040
and they've downloaded probably quite a

01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:17,520
few updates

01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:18,239
it's a lot less compelling than someone

01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:20,000
saying

01:48:18,239 --> 01:48:21,920
hey there's 10 million users hitting

01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:24,880
this website per day

01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:25,679
and we've delivered what 28 million

01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:30,000
downloads

01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:31,360
since we started for 2500 different bits

01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,600
of hardware

01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:34,719
um once you sort of give them exact

01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:36,480
numbers that's

01:48:34,719 --> 01:48:38,880
a lot more compelling to the likes of

01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:41,280
dell intel hp etc that sort of

01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:42,239
takes attention and there's no real way

01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:43,679
of sort of

01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:45,520
putting all these files on some mirror

01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:48,560
somewhere i don't have any idea of

01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:51,760
um any idea of uh

01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:52,400
um how effective if your system's

01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:54,239
actually working

01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:56,000
also randomly about the sign it's a

01:48:54,239 --> 01:48:58,080
really good way of um

01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:00,000
like sort of mental health point of view

01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:00,639
as well because i get emails maybe i

01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,320
don't know

01:49:00,639 --> 01:49:04,239
once a day twice a day saying you've

01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:05,679
done it wrong this is bad

01:49:04,239 --> 01:49:07,040
you should use this language you should

01:49:05,679 --> 01:49:08,639
have done this instead you should have

01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:09,440
used react you should have done this on

01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:10,719
the other

01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:12,560
you look at the sign and you think well

01:49:10,719 --> 01:49:13,520
actually the number keeps going up so

01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:16,000
that's kind of like

01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:17,280
proofs and something's going well um

01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,679
it's kind of like a nice little mental

01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:20,800
health

01:49:17,679 --> 01:49:23,280
kind of balance on that and we just turn

01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:23,280
on the mic

01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:26,800
um is that better

01:49:27,599 --> 01:49:32,800
maybe i should just stop being so

01:49:29,119 --> 01:49:32,800
excited and start to stop shouting

01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:37,760
oh no worries um right so the other

01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:39,040
thing is with the web app i didn't want

01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:42,080
to be spending time

01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:43,520
writing uh middleware service like the

01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:45,280
whole intention of this was to get

01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:48,960
firmer updates to end users

01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:50,400
as quickly as possible um

01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:51,840
so i chose an existing high-level

01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:53,360
language doesn't have to be hugely

01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:55,040
performant it's probably being used by

01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:56,960
three or four odms

01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:58,639
simultaneously which is nothing from a

01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:59,679
web app point of view

01:49:58,639 --> 01:50:03,040
and everything else is being g

01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:05,599
replicated on the cdn so i chose python

01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:06,080
um it's using flask as a kind of a high

01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:09,440
level

01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:11,679
kind of like a abstraction layer

01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:13,920
and sql alchemy is kind of a norm which

01:50:11,679 --> 01:50:15,520
is probably horribly inefficient

01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:17,119
but works really well and it's certainly

01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:18,400
good enough and easy to use from my

01:50:17,119 --> 01:50:20,000
point of view

01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:22,000
so my point is there's no need to

01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:25,040
architecture everything for

01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:27,360
sub 1 millisecond response time

01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:28,880
when it doesn't matter and the whole

01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:30,239
point of the architecture is to get

01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:33,440
firmware updates to users

01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:33,920
or in elias's point of view we want to

01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:35,840
get

01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:39,840
applications to end users we don't care

01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:39,840
about the the plumbing

01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:45,040
so i spent a lot of time this is what

01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:46,480
2015 um

01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:47,920
emailing an awful lot of companies

01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:49,599
probably i don't know three or four

01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:51,679
hundred different companies

01:50:49,599 --> 01:50:52,639
basically saying hey i'm richard i work

01:50:51,679 --> 01:50:54,159
at red hat

01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:55,760
um i've developed this system for

01:50:54,159 --> 01:50:56,960
installing firmware on devices

01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:59,760
i've got this website which you can

01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:01,199
upload firmware to for linux users are

01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:03,440
you interested

01:51:01,199 --> 01:51:04,880
and generally the response was either we

01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:07,599
don't care about linux users

01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:08,400
or yeah kind of maybe sounds interesting

01:51:07,599 --> 01:51:11,199
but the

01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:12,719
most common one was um we're already

01:51:11,199 --> 01:51:14,239
customers with red hat we're partners

01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:16,080
with red hat already

01:51:14,239 --> 01:51:18,239
can we switch to your red hat email and

01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:20,800
talk about stuff under nda

01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:22,159
now obviously working for a big company

01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:24,400
um like red hat

01:51:22,159 --> 01:51:25,520
it is i guess there's negatives and it's

01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:27,119
positive as well

01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:29,679
but in setting up something like this it

01:51:27,119 --> 01:51:30,800
was hugely hugely beneficial because i

01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:33,840
could talk to

01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:35,679
the logitechs the wacoms the intels the

01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:37,760
hps the dells

01:51:35,679 --> 01:51:40,480
um and they knew that red hat were doing

01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:43,119
this thing rather than the sun bloke

01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:45,119
some random blokum as i was described by

01:51:43,119 --> 01:51:46,239
microsoft or sunblock who works in his

01:51:45,119 --> 01:51:48,560
shed

01:51:46,239 --> 01:51:50,000
which is kind of true but maybe not in

01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:52,080
the spirit of things

01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:53,760
um so yeah so a lot of a lot of people

01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:54,080
were talking about this stuff um as like

01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:56,080
a

01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:58,000
as a good thing that came from red hat

01:51:56,080 --> 01:52:01,040
um rather than some random person

01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:01,920
although the kind of the the the subtext

01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:04,239
here is that

01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:06,000
a lot of the um maybe the first three

01:52:04,239 --> 01:52:07,760
years of the lvfs it was running

01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,840
on a little hp micro server underneath

01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:12,239
my stairs on my broadband

01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:14,400
um which is a point i'll come to in a

01:52:12,239 --> 01:52:17,040
minute

01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:19,119
so let's look at the last timeline so we

01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:21,280
started 2015-16

01:52:19,119 --> 01:52:22,239
and the first company was um hewski

01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:24,159
which is a

01:52:22,239 --> 01:52:26,320
company that i happened to run which

01:52:24,159 --> 01:52:28,800
produced the color hook hardware

01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:29,599
um and that was kind of like the first

01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:31,440
testing

01:52:29,599 --> 01:52:33,760
um sort of the real test for it because

01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:36,480
we had like an actual legitimate legal

01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:38,239
company and we had a device that we'd

01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:39,840
have a custom flashing protocol with a

01:52:38,239 --> 01:52:40,480
flashing file format and that kind of

01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:41,920
stuff

01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:43,679
it was like on a really good first test

01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:45,440
we could get into fedora

01:52:43,679 --> 01:52:46,719
test it does the architecture work does

01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:49,119
the device interface work

01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:50,719
um what input export tools do we need et

01:52:49,119 --> 01:52:52,480
cetera

01:52:50,719 --> 01:52:54,000
and the next step was talking to the

01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:54,480
people that could help me with this

01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,760
stuff

01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:57,119
people that would help me bootstrap this

01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:59,040
stuff and it turns out open source

01:52:57,119 --> 01:53:00,560
hardware is awesome

01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:01,760
because the sort of people that are

01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:03,920
producing open source hardware are

01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:06,480
producing low volumes of things

01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:08,480
um and they're highly technical people

01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:11,599
so something like um i don't know

01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:13,520
uh usb um smart charger or something

01:53:11,599 --> 01:53:14,800
and they might only produce 200 per year

01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:15,440
and they currently host the firmware

01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:18,159
updates

01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:18,800
on some i don't know some random ftp

01:53:18,159 --> 01:53:20,639
sites

01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:22,000
with no signing only five whatever and

01:53:20,639 --> 01:53:22,560
if you say look i've got this free

01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,960
service

01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:26,320
it kind of probably works for a use case

01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:28,880
um

01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:30,159
i'll probably actually use case um and

01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:32,239
it's completely free and we'll do

01:53:30,159 --> 01:53:33,599
signing and we'll manage all the ui

01:53:32,239 --> 01:53:35,280
and the command line stuff for those

01:53:33,599 --> 01:53:37,119
users they were like that sounds awesome

01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:38,560
it's less for me to do

01:53:37,119 --> 01:53:40,000
and also they were the sort of people

01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:41,599
that if something was missing that

01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:43,760
feature they needed either as a flashing

01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:44,320
protocol or in the website they'd submit

01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:46,000
a patch

01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:47,520
which was sort of awesome it was like a

01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:50,080
really good way to kind of kick start

01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:53,119
the entire ecosystem

01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:55,599
2017 dell were approached

01:53:53,119 --> 01:53:56,639
uh me um sort of with it sort of

01:53:55,599 --> 01:53:58,080
throughout that

01:53:56,639 --> 01:54:00,080
and said look we're thinking of doing

01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:01,840
this thing which is sort of similar to

01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:03,360
what the lvfs was but it makes way more

01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:04,800
sense for us to collaborate because we

01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:07,520
don't want to be in the sort of business

01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:09,440
of maintaining a web service

01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:11,920
um so maybe we could work together and

01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:14,560
so dell added support very quickly for

01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:15,280
their xps line iot line that kind of

01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:18,560
thing

01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:19,840
edge stuff and that was great um

01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:20,800
problem is when you're an early adopter

01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:23,199
you've got to do an awful lot of the

01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:24,239
work so dell wrote like the synaptics

01:54:23,199 --> 01:54:26,800
mst plugin

01:54:24,239 --> 01:54:27,679
the thunderbolt plug-in um and did a lot

01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:29,840
of work with the

01:54:27,679 --> 01:54:31,840
um youth capsule plugin which certainly

01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:33,760
was written initially by peter jones

01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:35,840
and so he kind of absorbed his project

01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:37,040
um sort of i guess claimed the credit

01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:40,000
for it

01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:41,920
um um but it meant that dell did an

01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:45,199
awful lot of work initially

01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:46,080
logitech got hit by um a security issue

01:54:45,199 --> 01:54:48,800
called mouse jack

01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:50,639
in 2018 and the harbor was basically

01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:52,000
being pulled out of data centers and

01:54:50,639 --> 01:54:53,920
stuff because you couldn't apply firm

01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:56,480
updates if you're running rel

01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:57,040
um and so they're kind of like kind of

01:54:56,480 --> 01:55:00,719
forced

01:54:57,040 --> 01:55:02,159
to join the ldfs um and push updates out

01:55:00,719 --> 01:55:03,360
using swfd

01:55:02,159 --> 01:55:05,280
and they added support for their

01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:07,760
unifying hardware and it's like

01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:09,360
they only uploaded maybe i don't know a

01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:10,800
dozen firmwares

01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:12,719
but there it appears that there is an

01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:15,760
awful lot of unifying hardware

01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:17,199
in the in the world um because all those

01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:19,840
12 firmwares have been downloaded

01:55:17,199 --> 01:55:21,520
millions of times um and it's brilliant

01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:22,719
for end users who don't have to worry

01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:24,560
about their machines being taken over at

01:55:22,719 --> 01:55:26,639
coffee shops and things with unifying

01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:29,040
mouse jack

01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:31,040
now i put down 2019 for logitech but

01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:32,800
it's not kind of tells the whole story

01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:34,639
because logitech relies quite a lot on

01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:35,679
their odms actual people that make the

01:55:34,639 --> 01:55:39,040
machines

01:55:35,679 --> 01:55:42,159
and so logitech's way of doing it was

01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:43,360
to get their odms and their ihvs their

01:55:42,159 --> 01:55:47,199
independent hardware vendors

01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:48,800
people like wacom rio real tech

01:55:47,199 --> 01:55:50,960
via that kind of thing people actually

01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:52,159
make the silicon that gets sold to the

01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:55,760
people like

01:55:52,159 --> 01:55:59,119
um foxconn westrom

01:55:55,760 --> 01:56:02,159
the odms and then kind of sell it on to

01:55:59,119 --> 01:56:04,880
under contract to the oem and so we kind

01:56:02,159 --> 01:56:06,960
of integrated the entire supply chain

01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:09,599
so there were va engineers writing

01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:11,760
plugins for via usb hubs and real tech

01:56:09,599 --> 01:56:15,440
engineers writing plugins for

01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:17,599
um real tech usb to um ethernet drivers

01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:20,960
and stuff

01:56:17,599 --> 01:56:22,400
um so that was great uh and lenovo

01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:23,920
obviously reused the code that was

01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:25,040
written for thunderbolt and we used the

01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:27,599
synaptics mst

01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:29,280
and the uv capsule and but still had to

01:56:27,599 --> 01:56:30,800
write quite a lot of code themselves and

01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:34,400
so they're probably working on this

01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:36,000
um before the logitech um announcement

01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:37,679
but it now means we have thinkpad think

01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:40,960
center think station

01:56:37,679 --> 01:56:43,760
hardware supported which is great

01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:44,480
hp last year literally found out they

01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:46,239
were losing

01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:47,679
contracts because they couldn't supply

01:56:46,239 --> 01:56:50,159
firmware updates in the lvfs

01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:50,719
and were kind of forced to add support

01:56:50,159 --> 01:56:54,239
for

01:56:50,719 --> 01:56:55,599
some models um that they wanted to sell

01:56:54,239 --> 01:56:56,400
for various government contracts and

01:56:55,599 --> 01:56:57,840
things

01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:59,520
and then found out actually there was a

01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:01,760
huge pr win for

01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:02,719
joining the rbfs and the sales of those

01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:05,599
models went up

01:57:02,719 --> 01:57:06,800
spectacularly so they've added a support

01:57:05,599 --> 01:57:08,320
this year for an awful lot more

01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:10,880
hardware and i've been told an awful lot

01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:13,119
more as planned um

01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:14,159
and hp all they had to do was write the

01:57:13,119 --> 01:57:18,159
hp specific

01:57:14,159 --> 01:57:22,000
plugins for things like hp um um

01:57:18,159 --> 01:57:22,320
cmx hubs and things but they could reuse

01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,960
the

01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:25,920
via plugin written by lenovo and the

01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:28,320
unifying hardware

01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:29,679
written by logitech and sometimes mst by

01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:32,000
dell you can sort of see how this is

01:57:29,679 --> 01:57:34,480
going like

01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:37,360
i've only listed a few oems here but the

01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:39,440
most common thing oems join the lvfs now

01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:40,639
um and they just can't believe that it's

01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:42,000
free so someone

01:57:40,639 --> 01:57:44,719
will join and they'll say look i've got

01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:46,719
this hub it's got a via usb hub

01:57:44,719 --> 01:57:48,080
and this rear real tech chip and it's

01:57:46,719 --> 01:57:50,719
got this um

01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:51,760
anx chip and i'm like yeah all that's

01:57:50,719 --> 01:57:53,360
supported you just have to

01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:55,440
add these six lines to this file with

01:57:53,360 --> 01:57:57,280
your vendor id and your product id and

01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:59,440
it just magically works and they're like

01:57:57,280 --> 01:58:00,719
how how does this work it's

01:57:59,440 --> 01:58:02,239
incomprehensible they have to

01:58:00,719 --> 01:58:04,320
they don't have to pay any money they

01:58:02,239 --> 01:58:05,119
don't have to rework it's the fact that

01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:06,880
open source

01:58:05,119 --> 01:58:08,719
means you can already reuse the same

01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:10,480
code and we can all support this all

01:58:08,719 --> 01:58:11,679
these different products with this one

01:58:10,480 --> 01:58:12,960
code base and they're coming from this

01:58:11,679 --> 01:58:14,800
world where

01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:16,800
they always have to pay they have to get

01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:18,800
paid to do this work

01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:20,719
um over and over again for all these

01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:21,679
different oems and it's just a complete

01:58:20,719 --> 01:58:23,679
kind of

01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:25,760
they just brain just explodes the other

01:58:23,679 --> 01:58:29,280
question i got asked is how is this free

01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:29,280
um i'll come to that in a minute

01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:34,880
so one of the things that surprised me

01:58:33,040 --> 01:58:37,280
is people started using

01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:39,119
updates from the ivfs as a way of

01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:41,199
choosing which hardware to buy

01:58:39,119 --> 01:58:43,360
um this maybe isn't such a surprise for

01:58:41,199 --> 01:58:44,480
people like kind of linux users and sort

01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:45,599
of people using this stuff in the

01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:48,159
community

01:58:45,599 --> 01:58:49,599
but actually the the graphs like but

01:58:48,159 --> 01:58:53,040
like you can see now

01:58:49,599 --> 01:58:53,599
were a direct um kind of ask from the uk

01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:55,119
government

01:58:53,599 --> 01:58:57,920
because they said look we want to choose

01:58:55,119 --> 01:58:59,360
laptops which are supported on the rvfs

01:58:57,920 --> 01:59:00,960
and we don't want to choose laptops that

01:58:59,360 --> 01:59:02,400
only have say one update

01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:04,159
just so they get the little green

01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:05,360
checkbox um

01:59:04,159 --> 01:59:06,880
but we actually want to see that they're

01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:07,920
actually supporting these laptops over

01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:10,560
the last few

01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:12,320
years and so for every there's now

01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:13,040
public graphs on the rbfs which means

01:59:12,320 --> 01:59:14,960
you can just

01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:17,440
look at every single model and see how

01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:19,840
how long this model been supported for

01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:21,760
and here you can see there's a xps 15

01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:22,239
which i guess on average probably about

01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:23,920
one

01:59:22,239 --> 01:59:26,080
update per quarter which is fairly

01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:26,639
typical and some vendors are very good

01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:29,040
at this

01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:30,719
um other vendors might only release one

01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:32,320
or two updates the first year

01:59:30,719 --> 01:59:34,560
and then they become kind of like just

01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:36,800
critical security issues only

01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:38,400
um this is uh quite a surprise um this

01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:40,239
is um

01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:42,159
something that i didn't expect but it

01:59:40,239 --> 01:59:44,239
also means it's been so like

01:59:42,159 --> 01:59:45,920
is on the lvfs it's now been baked into

01:59:44,239 --> 01:59:48,480
various us and uk

01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:51,679
um purchasing policy um which is kind of

01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:51,679
for an ecosystem that's brilliant

01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:55,119
now like i said a lot of people are very

01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:56,719
surprised this is free

01:59:55,119 --> 01:59:59,119
they don't understand that the question

01:59:56,719 --> 02:00:01,119
i get asked all the time is

01:59:59,119 --> 02:00:02,719
how long is it free for like what point

02:00:01,119 --> 02:00:06,159
do the fees kick in

02:00:02,719 --> 02:00:08,239
um and the way it works is um like my my

02:00:06,159 --> 02:00:09,679
job is being paid for by red hat and red

02:00:08,239 --> 02:00:11,360
tap paying um

02:00:09,679 --> 02:00:14,880
me to kind of build this ecosystem and

02:00:11,360 --> 02:00:18,080
build this this all these different um

02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:20,080
companies and this shared code um

02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:22,000
and i think what happened um i guess a

02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:23,599
couple years ago is the likes of dell

02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:25,440
lenovo hp etc

02:00:23,599 --> 02:00:27,360
went to the linux foundation said look

02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:28,239
we're building this multi-million dollar

02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:31,119
business

02:00:28,239 --> 02:00:32,080
uh on this eco on this linux um sort of

02:00:31,119 --> 02:00:35,040
um

02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:36,800
kind of pipeline and we're relying on

02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:38,080
this random bloke in england

02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:40,159
with this server that's running on the

02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:42,000
stairs can you kind of sort of

02:00:40,159 --> 02:00:44,400
professionalize that a bit

02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:45,040
so linux foundation now um they supplied

02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:46,960
a couple of

02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:48,320
assist admins which basically took my

02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:52,320
web service

02:00:48,320 --> 02:00:54,880
made it amazon's made it to microservice

02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:55,360
it's all running completely scalably now

02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:57,280
it's all

02:00:55,360 --> 02:00:58,800
backed up minute by minute and stuff and

02:00:57,280 --> 02:01:00,320
it's it's it's

02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:01,280
great that it's also not my problem so

02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:01,840
if it goes down in the middle of the

02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:04,400
night

02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:06,159
someone else gets paged and they fix it

02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:08,159
that's great

02:01:06,159 --> 02:01:10,159
also the key thing here is that red hat

02:01:08,159 --> 02:01:11,199
is this neutral party it's like the un's

02:01:10,159 --> 02:01:12,960
it's like when um

02:01:11,199 --> 02:01:16,639
if dell had gone to lenovo and said hey

02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:17,520
do you want to join this dell.lvfs.com

02:01:16,639 --> 02:01:18,880
thing

02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:21,440
probably lenovo probably would have said

02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:23,040
no but seeing as red hat is this neutral

02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:24,480
third party that doesn't really have any

02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:28,080
skin and skin in the game

02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:30,880
either way it's um it's sort of really

02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:32,800
really useful um like that of course i

02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:36,159
don't scale

02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:37,840
i i'm just one person um and i can't

02:01:36,159 --> 02:01:39,119
deal with 30 different iems

02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:41,199
and so there's all i think about a dozen

02:01:39,119 --> 02:01:41,920
different consulting companies now which

02:01:41,199 --> 02:01:45,199
provide

02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:46,719
um like people

02:01:45,199 --> 02:01:48,880
provide the ability to write plugins or

02:01:46,719 --> 02:01:50,639
converting old legacy code to the new

02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:53,040
kind of g object d code

02:01:50,639 --> 02:01:55,599
um or just train people on how licensing

02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:56,639
works and and how the rbfs sexual like

02:01:55,599 --> 02:01:59,840
ux

02:01:56,639 --> 02:02:00,719
works as well so let's get into the more

02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:04,159
interesting part

02:02:00,719 --> 02:02:04,960
to the presentation so there's a one of

02:02:04,159 --> 02:02:08,239
the things we

02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:09,679
trialled is any engineer can uh have an

02:02:08,239 --> 02:02:10,800
lvfs account they don't have to go

02:02:09,679 --> 02:02:13,199
through the whole legal thing if they

02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:15,440
just want to test things out privately

02:02:13,199 --> 02:02:17,280
which meant that we could um sort of

02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:19,040
build the ecosystem using the engineers

02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:20,239
so a realtic engineer could go

02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:22,320
create an account in the audio first

02:02:20,239 --> 02:02:22,960
upload real estate firmware find out how

02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:25,280
easy it is

02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:26,480
and say and say to his boss and say look

02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:27,520
well

02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:29,840
this is something that's going to cost

02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:32,080
us no money and get a huge amount of pr

02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:33,199
and means you can bid on these contracts

02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:36,159
um and then it's

02:02:33,199 --> 02:02:37,040
not me talking to sort of like the real

02:02:36,159 --> 02:02:39,199
tech cto

02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:41,199
it's some manager of some manager

02:02:39,199 --> 02:02:43,920
talking to the realtek cto

02:02:41,199 --> 02:02:45,760
which is a good way of onboarding um

02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:48,400
onboarding and random companies to try

02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:48,400
and do your thing

02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:53,040
but really at the end of the day the

02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:55,199
oems just want an easy life

02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:56,159
like lenovo told all their adm to

02:02:55,199 --> 02:02:59,679
suppliers

02:02:56,159 --> 02:03:02,320
um that lvfs and fwd is required

02:02:59,679 --> 02:03:02,880
dell similar google have basically said

02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:05,599
that

02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:06,880
if you don't do the fwd thing you lose

02:03:05,599 --> 02:03:08,880
the design for chromebook

02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:10,960
so it works with chromebook um sticker

02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:14,000
which is a big deal apparently

02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:16,800
um but they don't require use the rvfs

02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:17,679
which is fine um and the idea is here

02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:19,679
that you basically

02:03:17,679 --> 02:03:20,800
the oem can choose any rules you like so

02:03:19,679 --> 02:03:23,760
you can you can

02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:25,199
um make it someone else's problem um

02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:25,920
rather than having to worry about all

02:03:25,199 --> 02:03:28,320
the different

02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:30,080
relationships so i guess this is the

02:03:28,320 --> 02:03:31,599
slide that's more important from an lis

02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:32,480
kind of building an ecosystem point of

02:03:31,599 --> 02:03:34,639
view

02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:37,040
so i guess the the main things here is

02:03:34,639 --> 02:03:40,560
that we want to be installed by default

02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:41,920
um if someone like lenovo went to right

02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:43,360
hand said hey we've got this new

02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:46,159
architecture this new

02:03:43,360 --> 02:03:48,400
script or this new binary we use to

02:03:46,159 --> 02:03:50,400
install firmware on these servers

02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:51,840
rather than saying well you could

02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:53,199
install this other thing which also does

02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:54,800
the same thing

02:03:53,199 --> 02:03:56,560
if you're installed by default it means

02:03:54,800 --> 02:03:57,599
we already have something installed you

02:03:56,560 --> 02:03:58,560
probably should use the thing that's

02:03:57,599 --> 02:04:00,159
already installed

02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:02,719
rather than having to install this extra

02:04:00,159 --> 02:04:04,159
thing also because it's being like it's

02:04:02,719 --> 02:04:06,159
already part of rel

02:04:04,159 --> 02:04:08,079
it's not a case of it's adding one extra

02:04:06,159 --> 02:04:09,199
file to a package rather than adding a

02:04:08,079 --> 02:04:12,000
whole new package and

02:04:09,199 --> 02:04:13,199
sort of finding an sla and maintaining

02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,719
all that kind of stuff

02:04:13,199 --> 02:04:16,239
so actually the benefit of it being

02:04:14,719 --> 02:04:19,679
there

02:04:16,239 --> 02:04:21,920
is amazingly um important

02:04:19,679 --> 02:04:23,199
the other thing is being enabled by

02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:26,480
default

02:04:23,199 --> 02:04:29,119
so like for instance ubuntu i guess must

02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:30,239
um it must be great having the snapstore

02:04:29,119 --> 02:04:32,159
enabled by default

02:04:30,239 --> 02:04:33,599
and it's not a luxury we have in fedora

02:04:32,159 --> 02:04:36,960
with um flat pack

02:04:33,599 --> 02:04:39,840
um maybe maybe in the future but not now

02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:40,719
so having the lvfs enabled by default um

02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:43,599
means that

02:04:40,719 --> 02:04:45,199
rather than someone like hpe saying

02:04:43,599 --> 02:04:47,599
could you add this extra remote

02:04:45,199 --> 02:04:49,280
so that your servers contact this this

02:04:47,599 --> 02:04:50,800
website this web server so that we can

02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:52,000
get firmware updates

02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:53,840
because there's something else already

02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:56,239
installed by default you can say to them

02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:58,000
just use the thing that we already have

02:04:56,239 --> 02:04:59,840
which is quite compelling reason rather

02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:02,880
than just saying you can

02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:04,560
do one or the other also the

02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:06,079
the idea of plugins were that you could

02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:08,880
have the ihv for

02:05:06,079 --> 02:05:10,000
via um who make like usb hubs and lots

02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:11,520
of other stuff

02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,639
can own that bit of the code base they

02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:14,320
don't feel like they're completely out

02:05:12,639 --> 02:05:15,760
of control that they have no control

02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:18,159
over this unit this um

02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:18,800
this open source project they are kind

02:05:18,159 --> 02:05:20,719
of um

02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:21,840
integral part of it and it kind of means

02:05:20,719 --> 02:05:24,239
they have their own little like

02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:26,639
like fiefdom um which they can sort of

02:05:24,239 --> 02:05:26,639
control

02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:33,840
the second point i guess is um kind of

02:05:30,719 --> 02:05:35,440
against the idea of trying to avoid

02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:37,040
architecture astronauting

02:05:35,440 --> 02:05:38,560
but sooner or later you do have to just

02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:39,840
build functionality and kind of hope

02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:41,920
someone's going to use it

02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:43,599
and so i'll be developing features like

02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:44,159
especially with the plug-in library

02:05:43,599 --> 02:05:45,520
where

02:05:44,159 --> 02:05:47,280
i wasn't quite sure which vendors were

02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:47,760
going to be joining but i kind of knew

02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:50,000
that

02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:51,119
we'd probably need some i don't know usb

02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:54,560
control transfer

02:05:51,119 --> 02:05:57,760
abstraction or we might need some um

02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:58,400
i don't know engine um safe bike read

02:05:57,760 --> 02:06:01,199
functions

02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:03,280
and so sooner or later it does come down

02:06:01,199 --> 02:06:05,199
to actually writing some code so that

02:06:03,280 --> 02:06:06,239
the first person who says hey i want to

02:06:05,199 --> 02:06:08,480
be part of your club

02:06:06,239 --> 02:06:10,320
doesn't have to write half the ecosystem

02:06:08,480 --> 02:06:13,199
um before they can actually do something

02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:14,400
worthwhile this means that for the first

02:06:13,199 --> 02:06:16,000
year or two it was

02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:18,480
me writing an awful lot of code late at

02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:19,199
night um kind of praying that someone

02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:20,639
would use

02:06:19,199 --> 02:06:23,280
the the code that i'd spent all this

02:06:20,639 --> 02:06:23,280
time writing

02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:27,280
the other i guess the last point that is

02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:29,199
right from the start it was made very

02:06:27,280 --> 02:06:29,840
obvious by every single oem and odm i

02:06:29,199 --> 02:06:31,599
talked to

02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:34,320
that forward and backwards compatibility

02:06:31,599 --> 02:06:36,560
were a must you can't just convince

02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:37,520
millions of people running linux also

02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:40,560
old debians

02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:42,400
and the people running with some arch

02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:45,040
linux system you can't convince everyone

02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:47,119
to update to something at the same time

02:06:45,040 --> 02:06:48,400
and in the same way you can't ask oems

02:06:47,119 --> 02:06:50,079
who have literally put things into

02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:51,920
contracts with their

02:06:50,079 --> 02:06:53,520
suppliers to do something a different

02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:55,280
way now and so

02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:56,880
all the file formats and all the

02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:58,400
metadata are all forwards and backwards

02:06:56,880 --> 02:06:59,679
compatible so you can take a package

02:06:58,400 --> 02:07:01,520
that's been uploaded

02:06:59,679 --> 02:07:02,800
today and install it on the oldest

02:07:01,520 --> 02:07:04,320
debian stable

02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:05,760
uh and similarly in a package that was

02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:06,560
uploaded and they're unstable you can

02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:08,800
upload you can

02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:10,560
deploy it with the latest devwd and that

02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:12,000
kind of that compatibility forwards and

02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:14,480
backwards is really hard

02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:16,000
but if you design right from the start

02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:18,800
it's the difference between

02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:22,079
another kind of ecosystem where you

02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:22,079
don't have that compatibility

02:07:22,560 --> 02:07:26,880
last point on this slide is we design

02:07:24,880 --> 02:07:29,760
the system to not be cloned

02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:31,679
in the we didn't want there to be an

02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:32,880
intell vfs

02:07:31,679 --> 02:07:34,239
now you probably trust intel because

02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:37,280
you're running an intel processor you

02:07:34,239 --> 02:07:38,639
have intel microcode running right now

02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:41,360
because we didn't want things like an

02:07:38,639 --> 02:07:43,119
hpe lvfs be weird if you're on a dell

02:07:41,360 --> 02:07:45,679
laptop for it to be support

02:07:43,119 --> 02:07:46,480
for it to be pinging support.hp.com

02:07:45,679 --> 02:07:48,400
every

02:07:46,480 --> 02:07:49,920
every day from nothing else from a

02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:52,320
privacy point of view and a bandwidth

02:07:49,920 --> 02:07:53,840
and a power usage point of view as well

02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:55,679
but also some vendors that you're using

02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:57,280
stuff like if you're using a bluetooth

02:07:55,679 --> 02:07:58,320
mouse you're probably using pixar

02:07:57,280 --> 02:07:59,840
which probably a company you've never

02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:01,520
even heard of and you get kind of

02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:02,159
freaked out if your pc was contacting

02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:06,239
them every day

02:08:02,159 --> 02:08:07,760
with your epi address and user agent

02:08:06,239 --> 02:08:09,520
so the idea is although it's all open

02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:10,560
source code and even the website is all

02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:13,440
completely gpl

02:08:10,560 --> 02:08:15,280
um code you actually spin up an instance

02:08:13,440 --> 02:08:17,520
it's actually quite hard

02:08:15,280 --> 02:08:18,560
and because the signing key is part of

02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:20,320
the ftw

02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:22,000
package rather than downloaded from the

02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:25,199
rdfs is deliberately

02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:26,880
no way of adding extra signing keys or

02:08:25,199 --> 02:08:29,119
updating existing signing keys

02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:30,400
or adding remotes for other vendors and

02:08:29,119 --> 02:08:32,079
so it's a case of

02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:34,960
you either play by the rules that we've

02:08:32,079 --> 02:08:36,719
got or you can't deploy your firmware

02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:38,239
which is kind of an aggressive but kind

02:08:36,719 --> 02:08:40,159
of essential part of not being

02:08:38,239 --> 02:08:42,239
fragmented like this is like

02:08:40,159 --> 02:08:43,440
it's it's like a hugely monolithic kind

02:08:42,239 --> 02:08:44,960
of design

02:08:43,440 --> 02:08:46,800
but it wouldn't have had the success

02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:48,840
that it had without these kind of sort

02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:50,320
of strict rules that stopped this

02:08:48,840 --> 02:08:54,320
fragmentation

02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:54,320
for i guess a few different reasons

02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:57,920
the other thing that's important is the

02:08:55,840 --> 02:09:00,239
oem already does things a certain way

02:08:57,920 --> 02:09:01,520
like dell already calls their firmware

02:09:00,239 --> 02:09:03,840
um

02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:04,960
package tag and lenovo calls a build

02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:07,679
package name

02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:08,400
and so by providing a way of basically

02:09:07,679 --> 02:09:10,320
licensed like

02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:11,840
like an hour's work but it meant that

02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:13,040
the lenovo engineers were uploading

02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:15,520
firmware could see the

02:09:13,040 --> 02:09:16,159
terms and the urls they were familiar

02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:17,760
with

02:09:16,159 --> 02:09:19,280
rather than forcing them to learn about

02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:21,040
things like um

02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:23,119
build package names or something in the

02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:25,119
same way like with flatpak you wouldn't

02:09:23,119 --> 02:09:27,440
maybe expect the microsoft engineers to

02:09:25,119 --> 02:09:28,800
learn about the flat pack manifest

02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:30,639
because it's some the technology they're

02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:32,000
not using already so maybe there's some

02:09:30,639 --> 02:09:34,239
sort of like work that can be done

02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:37,679
there making it kind of more similar to

02:09:34,239 --> 02:09:37,679
the system that they're using already

02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:43,119
and also existing contracts exist

02:09:41,599 --> 02:09:43,440
between companies as maybe less relevant

02:09:43,119 --> 02:09:45,040
from

02:09:43,440 --> 02:09:46,639
app ecosystem point of view maybe more

02:09:45,040 --> 02:09:47,520
relevant from a firmware ecosystem point

02:09:46,639 --> 02:09:50,719
of view

02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:51,760
but you can't assume that your new fancy

02:09:50,719 --> 02:09:53,440
distribution method

02:09:51,760 --> 02:09:55,520
is going to be the one that's um going

02:09:53,440 --> 02:09:56,000
to be it's going to be the the only one

02:09:55,520 --> 02:09:58,840
that

02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:00,239
people are using so you kind of have to

02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:03,119
assume um

02:10:00,239 --> 02:10:05,280
that for instance here that wistron or

02:10:03,119 --> 02:10:07,119
foxconn or whoever the odm is is

02:10:05,280 --> 02:10:08,719
supplying hardware for an oem

02:10:07,119 --> 02:10:10,159
whom that phone might have come

02:10:08,719 --> 02:10:13,280
originally from the ibv

02:10:10,159 --> 02:10:15,840
like phoenix or ami or something

02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:17,280
so the rvfs has this idea that all the

02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:18,719
different companies would log in

02:10:17,280 --> 02:10:21,119
and then the firmware can be shared

02:10:18,719 --> 02:10:23,440
between companies so we kind of make

02:10:21,119 --> 02:10:24,960
we did all that work to integrate all

02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:28,239
these different suppliers

02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:29,599
um which um when the easier thing to do

02:10:28,239 --> 02:10:32,000
would be just let lenovo

02:10:29,599 --> 02:10:33,760
uh upload the firmware um but it means

02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,159
that you you're not then embedded into

02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:37,280
their

02:10:34,159 --> 02:10:40,320
supply chain you're just um sort of just

02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:41,840
like a ftp site now this meant that now

02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:43,840
when the contracts are negotiated

02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:45,920
between the odms and the ibvs

02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:46,960
that the lvfs and having an engineer

02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:48,639
that is familiar with

02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:50,719
uploading to rpfs is part of the

02:10:48,639 --> 02:10:52,000
contract which is awesome because this

02:10:50,719 --> 02:10:54,719
means that the ecosystem

02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:56,000
gets kind of cemented into this kind of

02:10:54,719 --> 02:10:58,480
this this pop this

02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:00,960
firmware thing and it's it's working

02:10:58,480 --> 02:11:00,960
really well

02:11:01,119 --> 02:11:04,000
but of course you're not the only

02:11:02,400 --> 02:11:06,079
ecosystem so in the same way that flat

02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:07,840
pack has snap and snap has flat pack

02:11:06,079 --> 02:11:10,400
there are two worlds or there are

02:11:07,840 --> 02:11:12,000
multiple worlds and so um

02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:16,079
our world at the moment are winners

02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:16,079
updates um and the rvfs

02:11:16,159 --> 02:11:19,360
and here we come a company called

02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:21,280
eclipsium

02:11:19,360 --> 02:11:22,719
have access to some of the microsoft

02:11:21,280 --> 02:11:24,880
data and also from the

02:11:22,719 --> 02:11:26,480
vendors themselves and we've actually

02:11:24,880 --> 02:11:28,960
provided tools for the

02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:30,400
vendors to kind of remind them when

02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:31,440
maybe linux users might have got a lot

02:11:30,400 --> 02:11:33,119
left out

02:11:31,440 --> 02:11:35,599
and there's i think in will's talk

02:11:33,119 --> 02:11:37,599
yesterday about

02:11:35,599 --> 02:11:40,320
some of the work on flat pack manifests

02:11:37,599 --> 02:11:42,880
where it might not be the flat pack is

02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:44,719
being um uploaded by the original

02:11:42,880 --> 02:11:46,000
software author and it might be that the

02:11:44,719 --> 02:11:48,320
original software author has chosen a

02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,960
different world to upload their software

02:11:48,320 --> 02:11:51,119
to

02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:52,320
it's actually giving the kind of the

02:11:51,119 --> 02:11:54,000
packager um

02:11:52,320 --> 02:11:55,679
the tools so that they know when things

02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,159
are out of date or i think he's updating

02:11:55,679 --> 02:11:57,840
or even

02:11:56,159 --> 02:11:59,679
automating it completely like for

02:11:57,840 --> 02:12:01,119
instance dell this is very

02:11:59,679 --> 02:12:02,719
useless for dell because dell has this

02:12:01,119 --> 02:12:04,639
build pipeline which automatically has a

02:12:02,719 --> 02:12:05,679
robot user which uploads firmware for

02:12:04,639 --> 02:12:07,679
various different models

02:12:05,679 --> 02:12:09,840
which then get qa'd by real people and

02:12:07,679 --> 02:12:11,440
then push to stable

02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:13,040
but for someone like level which bit

02:12:11,440 --> 02:12:14,320
more manual this is really useful and

02:12:13,040 --> 02:12:17,199
they can see at a glance

02:12:14,320 --> 02:12:17,599
what software is is maybe not to date

02:12:17,199 --> 02:12:21,840
both

02:12:17,599 --> 02:12:21,840
on lvfs and windows update

02:12:22,159 --> 02:12:26,480
so we've supplied like like 27.7 it's

02:12:24,239 --> 02:12:30,480
like 28.28.0 now

02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:31,679
um files it's like a 1.2 million a month

02:12:30,480 --> 02:12:34,400
or something now

02:12:31,679 --> 02:12:35,520
um but that might be a massive uh

02:12:34,400 --> 02:12:37,119
underestimate because as

02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:38,480
i mentioned right at the start we have

02:12:37,119 --> 02:12:40,719
the idea of where you can mirror the

02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:41,440
entire rvfs without us knowing about it

02:12:40,719 --> 02:12:44,639
for other

02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:45,440
security privacy or any other reason um

02:12:44,639 --> 02:12:47,440
but we know that

02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:49,119
2.1 million people have reported back

02:12:47,440 --> 02:12:51,599
success um

02:12:49,119 --> 02:12:53,119
which is not unexpected because we only

02:12:51,599 --> 02:12:56,239
ask one percent

02:12:53,119 --> 02:12:57,440
one set people using the console so you

02:12:56,239 --> 02:12:59,520
can kind of like

02:12:57,440 --> 02:13:01,520
use some back of the envelope maths and

02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:02,560
probably say that we've supplied really

02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:04,079
over 100 million

02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:06,560
firmware files which is something i'm

02:13:04,079 --> 02:13:08,079
really proud of um

02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:10,320
and when you take those numbers to an

02:13:08,079 --> 02:13:10,800
oem and say look this is the number we

02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:13,199
know

02:13:10,800 --> 02:13:13,920
um and we know that 12 million people

02:13:13,199 --> 02:13:17,040
every day

02:13:13,920 --> 02:13:18,800
look for the latest updates that's kind

02:13:17,040 --> 02:13:23,199
of super numbers that kind of

02:13:18,800 --> 02:13:23,199
take um take no people's notice

02:13:23,679 --> 02:13:28,079
so dell said that it's now strategically

02:13:25,760 --> 02:13:29,920
important for them to support the rbfs

02:13:28,079 --> 02:13:31,840
they've they've had a lot of good pr and

02:13:29,920 --> 02:13:33,920
also good business from this

02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:35,360
lenovo has said that standardizing has

02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:36,880
been seamless and i was just talking to

02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:38,719
intelligence a few days ago

02:13:36,880 --> 02:13:40,400
and they said they used windows update

02:13:38,719 --> 02:13:42,960
and lvfs

02:13:40,400 --> 02:13:44,159
and they called the windows update

02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:45,920
system painful

02:13:44,159 --> 02:13:48,320
and they said it could compare it being

02:13:45,920 --> 02:13:50,480
night and day compared to using the rbfs

02:13:48,320 --> 02:13:51,599
which i took as a really big compliment

02:13:50,480 --> 02:13:53,040
um and there's

02:13:51,599 --> 02:13:54,800
various people asking can we use the

02:13:53,040 --> 02:13:57,280
rbfs in

02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:58,639
on other platforms so google already

02:13:57,280 --> 02:14:00,159
using on chrome os

02:13:58,639 --> 02:14:02,320
but people say well can we use it on

02:14:00,159 --> 02:14:03,920
windows as well which is something that

02:14:02,320 --> 02:14:06,079
kind of blurs a line a little bit and

02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:09,760
it's not something i'm super comfortable

02:14:06,079 --> 02:14:09,760
with but yeah maybe i'm not sure

02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:13,679
so thank you for listening um i've

02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:17,119
rattled through this really quickly

02:14:13,679 --> 02:14:19,360
um i'm my personal email uh beta email

02:14:17,119 --> 02:14:20,960
and i also have twitter if you can talk

02:14:19,360 --> 02:14:22,320
to me grab me on any and talk to me

02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:27,840
about any stuff

02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:27,840
um thank you for listening

02:14:34,480 --> 02:14:37,679
how hard it is to get into the firmware

02:14:35,920 --> 02:14:39,040
world that various experience

02:14:37,679 --> 02:14:40,239
when you graduate hard is to find a

02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:41,360
company that hires you to provide

02:14:40,239 --> 02:14:42,400
selectors to put your knowledge about

02:14:41,360 --> 02:14:44,880
programming

02:14:42,400 --> 02:14:45,920
or the ecosystem of firmware however etc

02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:48,560
so i guess

02:14:45,920 --> 02:14:50,480
it's a kind of a big question but i'm an

02:14:48,560 --> 02:14:53,679
electronic engineer by trade

02:14:50,480 --> 02:14:56,480
so i thought um i graduated

02:14:53,679 --> 02:14:57,360
from surrey uni went to work for defense

02:14:56,480 --> 02:14:59,280
contractor

02:14:57,360 --> 02:15:00,560
doing electronic stuff and kind of got

02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:04,000
into software

02:15:00,560 --> 02:15:05,199
um but really like firmware isn't this

02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:08,079
big scary thing

02:15:05,199 --> 02:15:09,360
like programming on an arduino is

02:15:08,079 --> 02:15:11,440
firmware

02:15:09,360 --> 02:15:13,199
like when you flash an arduino it's

02:15:11,440 --> 02:15:15,520
that's what i call firmware

02:15:13,199 --> 02:15:17,840
so we have to do is like play with

02:15:15,520 --> 02:15:20,719
something like a pic microcontroller

02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:22,960
micro bit or something um and we have

02:15:20,719 --> 02:15:26,320
people distributing firmware on the rvfs

02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:27,760
with for arduino stuff so it doesn't

02:15:26,320 --> 02:15:29,520
you don't have to be some massive

02:15:27,760 --> 02:15:31,440
company like dell some people

02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:34,159
might only have 200 sales of some

02:15:31,440 --> 02:15:36,159
product from some open harbor product

02:15:34,159 --> 02:15:37,199
and they use the lvfs for distributing

02:15:36,159 --> 02:15:42,239
that

02:15:37,199 --> 02:15:42,239
that's sort of super useful for them um

02:15:42,719 --> 02:15:46,480
right i guess that's sort of fudged that

02:15:45,119 --> 02:15:48,000
first question

02:15:46,480 --> 02:15:49,840
second one how do you persuade companies

02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:51,280
to add their hardware firmware to lvfs

02:15:49,840 --> 02:15:52,159
and it's some completely persuaded

02:15:51,280 --> 02:15:56,239
others

02:15:52,159 --> 02:15:58,480
as the genuine extension market so

02:15:56,239 --> 02:15:59,440
it's really hard so ask me that question

02:15:58,480 --> 02:16:02,719
five years ago

02:15:59,440 --> 02:16:04,800
and i would have said you have to

02:16:02,719 --> 02:16:05,920
ask on twitter find their social media

02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:08,079
accounts

02:16:05,920 --> 02:16:08,960
try and get a contact in the company

02:16:08,079 --> 02:16:11,840
file bugs

02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:13,840
call the support line etc nowadays

02:16:11,840 --> 02:16:15,760
that's less true

02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:17,280
nowadays it's vendors who are bidding

02:16:15,760 --> 02:16:18,880
for government contracts finding they

02:16:17,280 --> 02:16:19,920
can't bid unless they have support on

02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:22,079
the rvfs

02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:23,520
for their firmware because the

02:16:22,079 --> 02:16:24,960
government contract wants to reuse the

02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:26,800
rdfs service to avoid

02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:29,760
obsolescence or security issues or for

02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:31,520
some sort of certification

02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:33,840
so it's kind of changed in the last five

02:16:31,520 --> 02:16:35,519
years from me pleading with vendors

02:16:33,840 --> 02:16:36,880
to them pleading with me so i've had

02:16:35,519 --> 02:16:37,359
vendors come to me in the past and said

02:16:36,880 --> 02:16:39,679
look

02:16:37,359 --> 02:16:41,200
we have this multi-million dollar sale

02:16:39,679 --> 02:16:42,000
and we can't complete this sale with

02:16:41,200 --> 02:16:44,319
this customer

02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:45,679
until the ibfs stuff has happened can

02:16:44,319 --> 02:16:46,399
you just say that the audio first stuff

02:16:45,679 --> 02:16:49,040
has happened

02:16:46,399 --> 02:16:49,840
and then um we'll do it in the next few

02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:53,040
months

02:16:49,840 --> 02:16:54,880
and i'm like so that's fraud and

02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:56,479
anyway so heaven and earth gets moved

02:16:54,880 --> 02:16:58,479
and they

02:16:56,479 --> 02:17:00,639
uh they actually do the work they need

02:16:58,479 --> 02:17:03,280
to do and the contract gets signed

02:17:00,639 --> 02:17:03,760
so i can kind of switch from being kind

02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:07,040
of

02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:09,359
asking like nicely to kind of be

02:17:07,040 --> 02:17:11,120
blunt being an because i can say

02:17:09,359 --> 02:17:12,559
i need you to use this metadata format i

02:17:11,120 --> 02:17:14,319
need to apply this data

02:17:12,559 --> 02:17:15,840
i need you to do these steps i need you

02:17:14,319 --> 02:17:18,000
to do this legal release

02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:19,519
i need you not to have a euler i need to

02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,880
not have a warranty statement all this

02:17:19,519 --> 02:17:24,080
kind of stuff where i can be quite

02:17:20,880 --> 02:17:26,639
blunt now um and actually although the

02:17:24,080 --> 02:17:29,120
linux market is two or three percent

02:17:26,639 --> 02:17:31,040
that's kind of the consumer

02:17:29,120 --> 02:17:32,399
kind of side of the linux market if

02:17:31,040 --> 02:17:34,080
you're someone like

02:17:32,399 --> 02:17:36,319
the us government uk government or

02:17:34,080 --> 02:17:37,439
something you're not the sort of person

02:17:36,319 --> 02:17:39,359
that's going to be filling in a survey

02:17:37,439 --> 02:17:41,519
that says oh i lose linux i use this

02:17:39,359 --> 02:17:44,639
disk draw i use this hardware

02:17:41,519 --> 02:17:47,679
so we like my guy instinct says that

02:17:44,639 --> 02:17:48,880
like in enterprise it's just hugely

02:17:47,679 --> 02:17:50,240
bigger than that number

02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:52,399
i'm just looking at the amount of effort

02:17:50,240 --> 02:17:54,639
companies putting on this kind of stuff

02:17:52,399 --> 02:17:56,639
um the other thing of course is chrome

02:17:54,639 --> 02:17:58,800
os when google turned around and said

02:17:56,639 --> 02:18:00,639
we need um we want to use fwd on chrome

02:17:58,800 --> 02:18:03,359
os which was i guess for two well

02:18:00,639 --> 02:18:04,800
at least three reasons one was they had

02:18:03,359 --> 02:18:07,519
a huge number of updaters

02:18:04,800 --> 02:18:08,880
on there in their mmc storage that is

02:18:07,519 --> 02:18:10,719
really expensive

02:18:08,880 --> 02:18:13,120
and each update was set like a 60

02:18:10,719 --> 02:18:15,280
megabyte statically linked blob

02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:17,120
um and with fwd each one of those

02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:19,840
updaters is a 15

02:18:17,120 --> 02:18:21,679
kilobyte blob because it's all using

02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:24,000
this shared functionality

02:18:21,679 --> 02:18:25,679
the other thing is security so the

02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:27,439
security team at google could actually

02:18:25,679 --> 02:18:29,280
review the code

02:18:27,439 --> 02:18:30,960
and say look this has passed our

02:18:29,280 --> 02:18:32,319
internal security review

02:18:30,960 --> 02:18:35,439
and we're going to build that and then

02:18:32,319 --> 02:18:37,359
distribute thousands of computers

02:18:35,439 --> 02:18:38,960
and it also meant that they could

02:18:37,359 --> 02:18:40,639
distribute firm updates

02:18:38,960 --> 02:18:42,000
all the stuff that we developed on linux

02:18:40,639 --> 02:18:43,679
and use on chrome os

02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:46,240
with almost no work they could just

02:18:43,679 --> 02:18:48,960
integrate into their own boot process

02:18:46,240 --> 02:18:50,800
um which meant that this the whole kind

02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:53,920
of works with chromebook certification

02:18:50,800 --> 02:18:55,519
which to me is a sticker is a huge deal

02:18:53,920 --> 02:18:56,319
for these companies so christmas last

02:18:55,519 --> 02:18:59,120
year

02:18:56,319 --> 02:18:59,760
i had about maybe 30 or 40 different

02:18:59,120 --> 02:19:01,760
companies

02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:04,800
sort of contact me and say look we need

02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:07,040
this otherwise we lose the sticker

02:19:04,800 --> 02:19:07,920
and so it was a very busy couple of

02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:10,800
months

02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:11,679
telling people about licensing and how

02:19:10,800 --> 02:19:13,679
he collaborate

02:19:11,679 --> 02:19:15,439
and how pull requests work and that kind

02:19:13,679 --> 02:19:17,599
of thing and that's where the

02:19:15,439 --> 02:19:19,359
kind of the the the need for the

02:19:17,599 --> 02:19:20,319
consulting companies came it's like the

02:19:19,359 --> 02:19:23,040
3m devs

02:19:20,319 --> 02:19:23,679
the collaborators the all the other kind

02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:25,519
of the

02:19:23,679 --> 02:19:27,679
companies that we're familiar with from

02:19:25,519 --> 02:19:29,280
like for developing linux apps

02:19:27,679 --> 02:19:31,280
are now the ones that are helping the

02:19:29,280 --> 02:19:33,519
com com um helping the

02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:35,359
the vendors get their firmware on the

02:19:33,519 --> 02:19:38,880
rbfs and also get

02:19:35,359 --> 02:19:39,599
um their flashing protocols into fwfd

02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:42,639
where we can all

02:19:39,599 --> 02:19:44,479
share them so last question

02:19:42,639 --> 02:19:46,559
um would you envision lvfs being used on

02:19:44,479 --> 02:19:49,040
more bespoke systems like cars and other

02:19:46,559 --> 02:19:50,880
iot devices

02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:52,399
really good question and i know people

02:19:50,880 --> 02:19:55,520
are using after upd

02:19:52,399 --> 02:19:57,200
on um there's a um i guess big oil

02:19:55,520 --> 02:20:00,840
company which is using

02:19:57,200 --> 02:20:02,240
um like a bazillion iot nodes for

02:20:00,840 --> 02:20:05,280
measuring

02:20:02,240 --> 02:20:07,840
um ground movement um

02:20:05,280 --> 02:20:09,520
and they're using fwd to deploy the

02:20:07,840 --> 02:20:11,439
firmware

02:20:09,520 --> 02:20:12,640
now they're not using the lvfs because

02:20:11,439 --> 02:20:14,160
what they want to do is they want to do

02:20:12,640 --> 02:20:15,280
like a stage deployment you don't want

02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:18,319
one update which

02:20:15,280 --> 02:20:20,080
bricks 10 000 nodes you

02:20:18,319 --> 02:20:21,520
so they're deploying they're doing test

02:20:20,080 --> 02:20:23,359
deployments on like lab

02:20:21,520 --> 02:20:25,520
versions of each different type of

02:20:23,359 --> 02:20:26,319
hardware and then before it goes out

02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:28,399
onto these

02:20:26,319 --> 02:20:29,680
sort of thousands of nodes um they're

02:20:28,399 --> 02:20:31,280
actually i think they use that's not

02:20:29,680 --> 02:20:32,240
ansible or something like a puppetee

02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:35,359
type thing

02:20:32,240 --> 02:20:38,000
to deploy the firmware using swd so

02:20:35,359 --> 02:20:40,160
the fact that the firmware is has been

02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:41,520
obtained from the rbfs is really useful

02:20:40,160 --> 02:20:42,800
for them because it's signed and they

02:20:41,520 --> 02:20:44,080
know where it's come from and they can

02:20:42,800 --> 02:20:47,120
rely on the vendor to supply

02:20:44,080 --> 02:20:48,720
updates for this hardware um

02:20:47,120 --> 02:20:51,120
it's probably more useful for them to

02:20:48,720 --> 02:20:52,560
control distribution themselves

02:20:51,120 --> 02:20:54,399
which is something we kind of don't i

02:20:52,560 --> 02:20:56,399
don't get into the whole kind of

02:20:54,399 --> 02:20:58,800
like fleet management stuff that's not

02:20:56,399 --> 02:20:59,920
something i think fwd or the rvfs wants

02:20:58,800 --> 02:21:02,479
to deal with

02:20:59,920 --> 02:21:04,000
um basically here's the metadata here's

02:21:02,479 --> 02:21:04,960
the mechanism and you can connect them

02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,319
however you like

02:21:04,960 --> 02:21:08,640
just kind of also having people at

02:21:06,319 --> 02:21:10,479
google do it as well

02:21:08,640 --> 02:21:12,720
so i think that's all the questions i

02:21:10,479 --> 02:21:14,319
think i've got no time

02:21:12,720 --> 02:21:16,000
so thank you all for listening if anyone

02:21:14,319 --> 02:21:17,840
wants to contact me use twitter use my

02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:20,160
work email use my personal email i'm

02:21:17,840 --> 02:21:22,880
happy to answer questions there as well

02:21:20,160 --> 02:21:24,640
okay thank you richard we are going to

02:21:22,880 --> 02:21:28,399
meet the next stop

02:21:24,640 --> 02:21:31,520
and we are going to listen chris davies

02:21:28,399 --> 02:21:32,720
i think i spelled it correctly thank you

you can rejoin with my

02:22:19,280 --> 02:22:23,840
yes i can't invoke you

give me a second please

02:22:58,399 --> 02:23:05,840
twist is not around i guess

02:23:06,399 --> 02:23:10,399
you are unlocked now try to rejoin with

02:23:08,080 --> 02:23:10,399
your mic

02:23:15,760 --> 02:23:22,080
okay i think you're

i think hello welcome

02:23:32,399 --> 02:23:38,560
okay maybe you can turn your volume

02:23:35,920 --> 02:23:39,280
a little bit up my volume up a little

02:23:38,560 --> 02:23:42,880
bit

02:23:39,280 --> 02:23:46,000
yeah okay it's not a bit uh

02:23:42,880 --> 02:23:48,960
seems good okay go ahead okay

02:23:49,680 --> 02:23:56,080
um great hello everyone uh i'm

02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:57,359
i'm rhys uh and you pronounced it uh

02:23:56,080 --> 02:23:59,840
wonderfully thank you

02:23:57,359 --> 02:24:01,840
i'm not sure who um put the scheduling

02:23:59,840 --> 02:24:03,439
together but next time i think i'll

02:24:01,840 --> 02:24:04,880
ask to go before richard because that

02:24:03,439 --> 02:24:08,880
was very good

02:24:04,880 --> 02:24:09,920
um and so from one random english bloke

02:24:08,880 --> 02:24:11,359
to another

02:24:09,920 --> 02:24:13,359
uh first i want to say thank you

02:24:11,359 --> 02:24:14,800
everyone for staying so long i know if

02:24:13,359 --> 02:24:16,479
this was in person

02:24:14,800 --> 02:24:18,399
uh conference everyone would have gone a

02:24:16,479 --> 02:24:20,319
drink at the break before last so

02:24:18,399 --> 02:24:22,080
while i introduced myself please feel

02:24:20,319 --> 02:24:23,840
free to get yourself a beer or some

02:24:22,080 --> 02:24:26,160
non-alcoholic beverage before i start

02:24:23,840 --> 02:24:26,640
chatting away uh this is the last talk

02:24:26,160 --> 02:24:28,479
so i'm

02:24:26,640 --> 02:24:29,760
i'm thinking of it for myself as a sort

02:24:28,479 --> 02:24:31,359
of closing keynote

02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:34,080
for my own ego but really it's just the

02:24:31,359 --> 02:24:36,479
last talk um

02:24:34,080 --> 02:24:38,960
uh so i'll just i'll just get started

02:24:36,479 --> 02:24:41,280
the title of this talk as you can see is

02:24:38,960 --> 02:24:42,800
on yourself with an ecosystem of linux

02:24:41,280 --> 02:24:45,359
apps

02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:46,000
soon the abstract for this talk was soon

02:24:45,359 --> 02:24:48,399
the likes

02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:50,000
of apple's m1 chip won't cost an arm and

02:24:48,399 --> 02:24:52,080
a leg

02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:53,520
uh in the not too distant future adding

02:24:52,080 --> 02:24:54,399
arm support to your applications is

02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:56,720
going to be crucial

02:24:54,399 --> 02:24:58,080
for reaching users but old and new and

02:24:56,720 --> 02:25:00,160
with everything happening

02:24:58,080 --> 02:25:02,479
uh with apple and within within

02:25:00,160 --> 02:25:05,040
acquisition of the arm by nvidia

02:25:02,479 --> 02:25:06,880
potentially coming soon i wanted to talk

02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:08,880
a little bit about ubuntu's plan

02:25:06,880 --> 02:25:10,880
for support and how you can start

02:25:08,880 --> 02:25:12,479
testing and developing for our

02:25:10,880 --> 02:25:14,479
uh using software and workflows that

02:25:12,479 --> 02:25:17,600
you're using today already

02:25:14,479 --> 02:25:19,840
uh so let me just close the chat here so

02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:23,760
i don't get too distracted

02:25:19,840 --> 02:25:26,800
um and we can dive

02:25:23,760 --> 02:25:28,640
in next slide okay cool

02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:29,920
so uh first i'll tell you a little bit

02:25:28,640 --> 02:25:32,640
about myself i'm

02:25:29,920 --> 02:25:34,560
reece davis i'm a developer advocate for

02:25:32,640 --> 02:25:37,520
ubuntu for canonical

02:25:34,560 --> 02:25:38,560
i've been in this role for a few months

02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:40,800
now where i've

02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:42,479
joined the community team the rebooted

02:25:40,800 --> 02:25:44,800
community team i should say

02:25:42,479 --> 02:25:46,880
economically focusing specifically on

02:25:44,800 --> 02:25:49,520
supporting and helping the

02:25:46,880 --> 02:25:51,280
community grow and and enable them to do

02:25:49,520 --> 02:25:53,200
things

02:25:51,280 --> 02:25:54,399
and before that i was a product manager

02:25:53,200 --> 02:25:56,080
for canonical

02:25:54,399 --> 02:25:58,319
for about a year and a half where i

02:25:56,080 --> 02:26:01,920
looked after numerous different products

02:25:58,319 --> 02:26:02,479
over there from robotics and iot type

02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:05,280
things

02:26:02,479 --> 02:26:06,560
and snaps to add a little bit of desktop

02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:08,880
a little bit of multi-pass

02:26:06,560 --> 02:26:09,680
some virtualization stacks and that kind

02:26:08,880 --> 02:26:11,520
of thing so i

02:26:09,680 --> 02:26:13,359
i covered a lot of the landscape and

02:26:11,520 --> 02:26:16,560
along the way i very much

02:26:13,359 --> 02:26:17,760
drank the open source kool-aid and and

02:26:16,560 --> 02:26:19,359
it was part of the reason i joined the

02:26:17,760 --> 02:26:20,160
company drawing kernel in the first

02:26:19,359 --> 02:26:21,520
place but then

02:26:20,160 --> 02:26:23,120
the more i got into it the more i

02:26:21,520 --> 02:26:23,760
enjoyed the more i saw the value and

02:26:23,120 --> 02:26:26,800
what

02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:27,920
folks like you do and what uh what open

02:26:26,800 --> 02:26:29,840
source is about

02:26:27,920 --> 02:26:32,240
and obviously principles and i uh i

02:26:29,840 --> 02:26:34,000
really really sort of got inspired

02:26:32,240 --> 02:26:36,399
and then a little a couple of other

02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:37,600
things about me uh i like books i like

02:26:36,399 --> 02:26:38,960
reading i'm a bit of a

02:26:37,600 --> 02:26:41,200
big old book nerd when it comes to

02:26:38,960 --> 02:26:42,720
reading and writing uh i joined the

02:26:41,200 --> 02:26:43,760
circus for a few months not terribly

02:26:42,720 --> 02:26:45,439
long ago

02:26:43,760 --> 02:26:47,600
i ran away with the circus and the

02:26:45,439 --> 02:26:50,240
little groovy gorilla down there was

02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:51,520
uh the eventual release that i last uh

02:26:50,240 --> 02:26:54,479
sort of led in a

02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:56,160
little ubuntu t-shirt here um i just

02:26:54,479 --> 02:26:58,800
want to say as well before i get into

02:26:56,160 --> 02:27:00,720
the rest uh the meat of the presentation

02:26:58,800 --> 02:27:02,080
while richard's story before me was very

02:27:00,720 --> 02:27:04,000
good and very interesting

02:27:02,080 --> 02:27:06,800
and very real mine's a bit more of a

02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:10,160
fall experiment a bit more of a fiction

02:27:06,800 --> 02:27:14,800
so um yeah let's

02:27:10,160 --> 02:27:16,399
go all right

02:27:14,800 --> 02:27:18,240
the animations didn't work terribly well

02:27:16,399 --> 02:27:19,600
okay uh once upon a time

02:27:18,240 --> 02:27:21,760
so yeah so i'm going to be telling you a

02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:23,600
little bit of a story so uh bear with me

02:27:21,760 --> 02:27:25,280
if it starts to get a bit weird

02:27:23,600 --> 02:27:27,120
once upon a time in a hole in the ground

02:27:25,280 --> 02:27:30,560
in a cupboard under the stairs

02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:34,160
uh in a galaxy far far away or on github

02:27:30,560 --> 02:27:36,319
i want everybody to imagine a developer

02:27:34,160 --> 02:27:38,640
she is like many of us maybe she has a

02:27:36,319 --> 02:27:40,080
job maybe she works for a tech company

02:27:38,640 --> 02:27:41,760
maybe she works in a corner shop it

02:27:40,080 --> 02:27:43,840
doesn't really matter

02:27:41,760 --> 02:27:45,439
but she's just getting started in app

02:27:43,840 --> 02:27:47,760
development

02:27:45,439 --> 02:27:49,359
uh let's let's let's say she spends her

02:27:47,760 --> 02:27:50,080
time surfing the web scrolling through

02:27:49,359 --> 02:27:51,840
projects

02:27:50,080 --> 02:27:53,840
looking at open source repos looking for

02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:55,760
something to contribute to

02:27:53,840 --> 02:27:58,240
and she has an idea she wants to build

02:27:55,760 --> 02:27:58,800
an app whatever that app is it doesn't

02:27:58,240 --> 02:28:01,359
matter

02:27:58,800 --> 02:28:03,439
let's just say it's any app for now

02:28:01,359 --> 02:28:05,280
let's say it's a command line tool that

02:28:03,439 --> 02:28:06,640
i don't know tracks the stocks that

02:28:05,280 --> 02:28:08,800
she's invested in

02:28:06,640 --> 02:28:10,240
we'll call it stonker uh just for the

02:28:08,800 --> 02:28:12,160
sake of this presentation since it's the

02:28:10,240 --> 02:28:13,520
last one we can have a little bit of fun

02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:14,720
and that was supposed to be an animation

02:28:13,520 --> 02:28:15,280
on the screen so it's a bit of a

02:28:14,720 --> 02:28:18,160
surprise

02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:19,439
but there we are uh she does this in her

02:28:18,160 --> 02:28:21,760
free time

02:28:19,439 --> 02:28:23,439
after work on the weekends uh she really

02:28:21,760 --> 02:28:26,080
wants to build something of it

02:28:23,439 --> 02:28:28,000
uh help people track their stonks uh

02:28:26,080 --> 02:28:28,640
maybe she wants to roadmaps and worked

02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,560
as

02:28:28,640 --> 02:28:32,080
a feature to crawl reddit for the next

02:28:30,560 --> 02:28:33,040
opportunity to stick it to the man in

02:28:32,080 --> 02:28:34,720
the future

02:28:33,040 --> 02:28:36,960
maybe even build the community around

02:28:34,720 --> 02:28:39,520
her app but that's all down the road

02:28:36,960 --> 02:28:40,000
her first problem is just where to start

02:28:39,520 --> 02:28:41,840
for the sake

02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:44,240
of this uh story for the sake of this

02:28:41,840 --> 02:28:44,640
presentation let's say this is her first

02:28:44,240 --> 02:28:46,880
time

02:28:44,640 --> 02:28:48,560
developing an app an open source app

02:28:46,880 --> 02:28:50,720
that way we can look at

02:28:48,560 --> 02:28:52,160
what's out there a little bit more and

02:28:50,720 --> 02:28:53,760
really dig into

02:28:52,160 --> 02:28:56,160
a first-timer's experience and really

02:28:53,760 --> 02:28:58,000
examined the whole process a little bit

02:28:56,160 --> 02:29:00,080
i'm sure we've all been there i know i

02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:01,840
have where we have this idea maybe a

02:29:00,080 --> 02:29:03,920
project idea maybe something

02:29:01,840 --> 02:29:05,520
we want to contribute to and we go

02:29:03,920 --> 02:29:07,760
hunting for where to start

02:29:05,520 --> 02:29:09,439
where to begin how to begin quite

02:29:07,760 --> 02:29:11,439
importantly

02:29:09,439 --> 02:29:14,160
and well so let's have a look at what

02:29:11,439 --> 02:29:17,439
she might find

02:29:14,160 --> 02:29:21,520
ah here we see

02:29:17,439 --> 02:29:23,920
our first sort of plot twist

02:29:21,520 --> 02:29:25,520
how do you how do you get started well

02:29:23,920 --> 02:29:28,560
where you

02:29:25,520 --> 02:29:30,319
where would you begin yeah i think

02:29:28,560 --> 02:29:32,319
we need more articles about this kind of

02:29:30,319 --> 02:29:34,399
thing about where where to begin with

02:29:32,319 --> 02:29:35,359
with linux if you just search how to

02:29:34,399 --> 02:29:36,880
develop an app if you don't know

02:29:35,359 --> 02:29:38,399
anything about linux and for this

02:29:36,880 --> 02:29:40,000
case obviously we're assuming that we

02:29:38,399 --> 02:29:41,760
don't know anything about limits

02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:44,160
you would get you would find yourself in

02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:45,920
a rabbit hole of mobile apps

02:29:44,160 --> 02:29:47,120
i didn't take any screenshots only

02:29:45,920 --> 02:29:48,960
because it looked a bit weird on the

02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:51,200
slides so i did what we did here

02:29:48,960 --> 02:29:52,720
uh i apologize for the funky colors i'm

02:29:51,200 --> 02:29:54,800
not i'm not a designer

02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:56,160
uh this is no other filters of course if

02:29:54,800 --> 02:29:57,760
she knew she was interested in linux

02:29:56,160 --> 02:29:59,920
maybe she would have added linux but

02:29:57,760 --> 02:30:01,280
maybe she wouldn't as well if she went

02:29:59,920 --> 02:30:03,200
off on her first search

02:30:01,280 --> 02:30:04,720
uh here she'd end up down the mobile app

02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:06,240
rabbit hole and would have found their

02:30:04,720 --> 02:30:09,120
way and found her way

02:30:06,240 --> 02:30:10,010
to ios or android long before she would

02:30:09,120 --> 02:30:12,319
have thought about linux

02:30:10,010 --> 02:30:16,319
[Music]

02:30:12,319 --> 02:30:18,560
uh it seems like

02:30:16,319 --> 02:30:19,359
it seems like any bloggers out there uh

02:30:18,560 --> 02:30:21,359
have a nice

02:30:19,359 --> 02:30:22,880
seo target with this even when i

02:30:21,359 --> 02:30:23,840
searched desktop as you can see here

02:30:22,880 --> 02:30:26,080
specifically

02:30:23,840 --> 02:30:28,319
it was all windows documentation and

02:30:26,080 --> 02:30:30,319
that's windows documentation

02:30:28,319 --> 02:30:31,680
and in in my personal opinion those docs

02:30:30,319 --> 02:30:34,479
aren't particularly good

02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:35,920
and very attractive looking so this is

02:30:34,479 --> 02:30:37,120
sort of my first call to action and i'll

02:30:35,920 --> 02:30:38,160
get into the point of this talk in a

02:30:37,120 --> 02:30:41,680
second i promise

02:30:38,160 --> 02:30:43,840
um we need more visibility on developing

02:30:41,680 --> 02:30:44,880
linux apps in terms of documentation and

02:30:43,840 --> 02:30:47,359
writing and

02:30:44,880 --> 02:30:49,120
blog posts and people talking about it

02:30:47,359 --> 02:30:49,840
if we want first timers to go down the

02:30:49,120 --> 02:30:52,800
good

02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:54,240
happy linux rabbit hole and i think we

02:30:52,800 --> 02:30:56,479
do

02:30:54,240 --> 02:30:58,240
uh let's start targeting getting started

02:30:56,479 --> 02:30:59,680
blogs specific keywords

02:30:58,240 --> 02:31:01,439
or building up the google juice

02:30:59,680 --> 02:31:02,640
weightings of sites that are doing this

02:31:01,439 --> 02:31:05,040
already

02:31:02,640 --> 02:31:06,880
i'm not sure if you'll get these slides

02:31:05,040 --> 02:31:08,000
uh after the event or not but there's a

02:31:06,880 --> 02:31:10,720
nice url

02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:12,399
at the bottom of it you can see there of

02:31:10,720 --> 02:31:13,200
the search results that only came up

02:31:12,399 --> 02:31:14,720
when i looked for

02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:16,080
which was the only linux related thing

02:31:14,720 --> 02:31:16,640
that i came up when i searched this

02:31:16,080 --> 02:31:19,200
actually

02:31:16,640 --> 02:31:20,880
which was make a linux dot app i'm sure

02:31:19,200 --> 02:31:23,280
some of you would have seen it before

02:31:20,880 --> 02:31:24,720
or even uh maybe even had a hand in in

02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:28,080
building it but it's a place to go

02:31:24,720 --> 02:31:29,520
a place to start uh it's this is

02:31:28,080 --> 02:31:31,439
it's exactly the kind of thing that

02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:34,160
we're looking for uh

02:31:31,439 --> 02:31:34,960
in terms of distribution of of people

02:31:34,160 --> 02:31:36,479
but we also

02:31:34,960 --> 02:31:37,920
need people talking about the apps that

02:31:36,479 --> 02:31:38,640
they're making and conferences like this

02:31:37,920 --> 02:31:41,680
are an awesome

02:31:38,640 --> 02:31:43,760
awesome awesome thing for doing that

02:31:41,680 --> 02:31:45,359
it just needs to translate into the

02:31:43,760 --> 02:31:47,359
google juice right

02:31:45,359 --> 02:31:48,880
uh my my contact details at the end of

02:31:47,359 --> 02:31:49,840
this presentation if you're writing a

02:31:48,880 --> 02:31:51,920
linux apps

02:31:49,840 --> 02:31:53,439
blog or creating linux app content and

02:31:51,920 --> 02:31:53,920
would like a hand optimizing this kind

02:31:53,439 --> 02:31:57,200
of thing

02:31:53,920 --> 02:31:58,160
just let me know anyway this is the

02:31:57,200 --> 02:32:00,399
linux app

02:31:58,160 --> 02:32:02,560
summit so let's move past this let's say

02:32:00,399 --> 02:32:04,160
she finds her way to open source

02:32:02,560 --> 02:32:05,760
maybe to linux but more importantly she

02:32:04,160 --> 02:32:07,920
finds a way to open source

02:32:05,760 --> 02:32:09,760
communities somewhere she can do her

02:32:07,920 --> 02:32:10,640
work in the open and if she runs into

02:32:09,760 --> 02:32:12,399
issues

02:32:10,640 --> 02:32:15,040
there are active forums for questions

02:32:12,399 --> 02:32:16,560
and uses for contributions

02:32:15,040 --> 02:32:18,479
she hasn't got time for courses let's

02:32:16,560 --> 02:32:20,240
say she just wants to get stuck in

02:32:18,479 --> 02:32:21,600
so she looks for tutorials right

02:32:20,240 --> 02:32:24,800
documentation maybe

02:32:21,600 --> 02:32:26,880
youtube videos surely i know i would

02:32:24,800 --> 02:32:28,479
now this is where we need a little bit

02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:29,520
of suspension of disbelief

02:32:28,479 --> 02:32:31,520
and she's reading through the

02:32:29,520 --> 02:32:33,359
documentation she's watching the youtube

02:32:31,520 --> 02:32:35,520
videos getting inspired

02:32:33,359 --> 02:32:37,200
there's a lot of interesting things

02:32:35,520 --> 02:32:38,800
going on but in her search

02:32:37,200 --> 02:32:40,720
she's looking for something new

02:32:38,800 --> 02:32:42,160
something exciting something that she

02:32:40,720 --> 02:32:43,359
can get ahead of and really try

02:32:42,160 --> 02:32:45,040
something

02:32:43,359 --> 02:32:47,520
now this is a bit of a jump but maybe

02:32:45,040 --> 02:32:50,720
she sees certain developers she follows

02:32:47,520 --> 02:32:53,280
on twitter say raving about the m1

02:32:50,720 --> 02:32:54,720
chip it's more specifically she finds

02:32:53,280 --> 02:32:58,319
maybe the apple macbook

02:32:54,720 --> 02:33:00,319
air with an m1 chip

02:32:58,319 --> 02:33:02,080
people talking about that for better or

02:33:00,319 --> 02:33:04,560
for worse

02:33:02,080 --> 02:33:05,760
oh she thinks right it's the new shiny

02:33:04,560 --> 02:33:08,960
it's interesting

02:33:05,760 --> 02:33:10,960
it's performant okay it's apple yeah

02:33:08,960 --> 02:33:14,319
blah blah blah it's expensive which is a

02:33:10,960 --> 02:33:17,040
pain it's got an arm processor

02:33:14,319 --> 02:33:17,840
hello that's interesting she realizes

02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:19,920
wait a minute

02:33:17,840 --> 02:33:21,120
and what would have to be that would

02:33:19,920 --> 02:33:21,840
have to be a whole new class of

02:33:21,120 --> 02:33:24,399
application

02:33:21,840 --> 02:33:26,960
right it would have to be built for this

02:33:24,399 --> 02:33:29,439
hardware built for arm head hardware

02:33:26,960 --> 02:33:30,240
so she searches um so she searches

02:33:29,439 --> 02:33:33,600
around

02:33:30,240 --> 02:33:34,240
what's up with r right and uh no no no

02:33:33,600 --> 02:33:36,560
no we don't

02:33:34,240 --> 02:33:38,880
let's try arm silicon because this isn't

02:33:36,560 --> 02:33:42,399
what we're here for

02:33:38,880 --> 02:33:44,479
um ah it was all apple

02:33:42,399 --> 02:33:45,920
apps on arm silicon just gives you

02:33:44,479 --> 02:33:46,319
everything apple or at least it did for

02:33:45,920 --> 02:33:49,280
me

02:33:46,319 --> 02:33:51,439
in my location uh now that's doing a

02:33:49,280 --> 02:33:53,439
good job of articles apple have

02:33:51,439 --> 02:33:54,800
really sort of cornered this one maybe

02:33:53,439 --> 02:33:57,200
if there are any amongst

02:33:54,800 --> 02:33:58,160
any people out there amongst you who i

02:33:57,200 --> 02:33:59,680
want to start writing

02:33:58,160 --> 02:34:01,920
documentation or tutorials for the next

02:33:59,680 --> 02:34:03,200
app development on arm this is another

02:34:01,920 --> 02:34:05,760
sort of seo

02:34:03,200 --> 02:34:07,120
sort of google target for you and again

02:34:05,760 --> 02:34:10,000
i'd be happy to help

02:34:07,120 --> 02:34:11,920
uh juicing those articles for google

02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:14,800
because it looks like we need a lot more

02:34:11,920 --> 02:34:15,439
visibility for the apps keyword in

02:34:14,800 --> 02:34:17,439
general

02:34:15,439 --> 02:34:18,560
but let's say for the sake of brevity

02:34:17,439 --> 02:34:20,960
she finds herself

02:34:18,560 --> 02:34:22,880
on the nvidia news right she goes

02:34:20,960 --> 02:34:25,439
looking for an arm specific content

02:34:22,880 --> 02:34:26,000
and perhaps the fable algorithm throws

02:34:25,439 --> 02:34:28,240
up a

02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:30,240
news article now of course she's heard

02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:32,640
of nvidia right who hasn't

02:34:30,240 --> 02:34:33,680
she knows they'd do crazy gpu stuff

02:34:32,640 --> 02:34:36,880
right

02:34:33,680 --> 02:34:40,319
cool videos acquiring arm

02:34:36,880 --> 02:34:42,840
oh now that's something she picks up on

02:34:40,319 --> 02:34:44,640
that's something that's quite

02:34:42,840 --> 02:34:47,920
interesting

02:34:44,640 --> 02:34:50,240
uh blink next slide okay so

02:34:47,920 --> 02:34:52,960
this could be serious right not just not

02:34:50,240 --> 02:34:54,720
just sort of fruit associated with apple

02:34:52,960 --> 02:34:56,080
oh wait okay so she realizes the

02:34:54,720 --> 02:34:57,920
implications of this

02:34:56,080 --> 02:34:59,520
even if we just zoom in on linux and

02:34:57,920 --> 02:35:01,760
desktop applications

02:34:59,520 --> 02:35:03,359
if folks like apple are already moving

02:35:01,760 --> 02:35:05,520
towards desktop class

02:35:03,359 --> 02:35:07,439
arm hardware you can bet your bottom

02:35:05,520 --> 02:35:09,120
dollar other hardware vendors are

02:35:07,439 --> 02:35:11,520
working on it too

02:35:09,120 --> 02:35:13,680
equally you can bet nvidia have noticed

02:35:11,520 --> 02:35:16,560
i've seen a lot of good things about it

02:35:13,680 --> 02:35:17,280
uh but that's really matter the point is

02:35:16,560 --> 02:35:18,800
with arm

02:35:17,280 --> 02:35:20,319
a company partners with just about

02:35:18,800 --> 02:35:23,680
everybody microsoft intel

02:35:20,319 --> 02:35:26,080
qualcomm apple amazon ibm nintendo

02:35:23,680 --> 02:35:28,399
and so on on embedded devices getting

02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:30,399
leveled up by sort of invidious gpus and

02:35:28,399 --> 02:35:32,080
servers and super computer stacks

02:35:30,399 --> 02:35:33,680
you can be sure that embedded devices

02:35:32,080 --> 02:35:35,439
will get smarter

02:35:33,680 --> 02:35:37,040
and workstation vendors will be able to

02:35:35,439 --> 02:35:38,640
leverage that technology

02:35:37,040 --> 02:35:41,840
and it means that linux will be coming

02:35:38,640 --> 02:35:45,120
to embedded devices and on desktops

02:35:41,840 --> 02:35:47,520
uh certainly which is um

02:35:45,120 --> 02:35:48,800
which is all on its way right so what's

02:35:47,520 --> 02:35:52,319
missing over there

02:35:48,800 --> 02:35:55,280
as ever it's apps right building new or

02:35:52,319 --> 02:35:56,160
adapting old linux apps for arm is going

02:35:55,280 --> 02:36:00,000
to become

02:35:56,160 --> 02:36:01,120
uh crucial and she recognizes this let's

02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,240
say she recognizes this in our

02:36:01,120 --> 02:36:05,200
presentation

02:36:02,240 --> 02:36:06,240
so she thinks okay what else is um how

02:36:05,200 --> 02:36:08,720
can we learn more

02:36:06,240 --> 02:36:09,920
so she discovers um is typically for the

02:36:08,720 --> 02:36:13,520
embedded space

02:36:09,920 --> 02:36:16,319
right okay phones nice fridges it's cool

02:36:13,520 --> 02:36:16,800
tablets that's interesting iot devices

02:36:16,319 --> 02:36:19,439
that's

02:36:16,800 --> 02:36:20,000
buzzwordy but where's the innovation

02:36:19,439 --> 02:36:22,560
right now

02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:23,200
she looks around and it's cloud right uh

02:36:22,560 --> 02:36:26,240
amazon

02:36:23,200 --> 02:36:27,920
graviton two there's a two edge compute

02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:29,760
clustering blah blah blah

02:36:27,920 --> 02:36:31,760
okay she's convinced there's a there's

02:36:29,760 --> 02:36:34,000
definitely a future in this

02:36:31,760 --> 02:36:35,439
so she decides to dig in now i'm aware

02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,880
this isn't normally how

02:36:35,439 --> 02:36:39,359
application development goes people

02:36:36,880 --> 02:36:40,399
don't usually um

02:36:39,359 --> 02:36:42,560
people usually decide on the

02:36:40,399 --> 02:36:44,000
architecture first i'd presume i'm not a

02:36:42,560 --> 02:36:44,560
developer so i won't know specifically

02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:47,600
but just

02:36:44,560 --> 02:36:50,560
bear with me we'll we'll get to that um

02:36:47,600 --> 02:36:51,120
so she wants to start developing for a

02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:53,680
for this

02:36:51,120 --> 02:36:54,640
should we say non standard architecture

02:36:53,680 --> 02:36:56,319
for desktop maps

02:36:54,640 --> 02:36:57,680
so she definitely wants to do that but

02:36:56,319 --> 02:36:59,120
she wants to get ahead of the curve you

02:36:57,680 --> 02:37:00,640
know break new ground maybe she could

02:36:59,120 --> 02:37:01,520
turn it into a mobile or embed it up

02:37:00,640 --> 02:37:04,160
later

02:37:01,520 --> 02:37:05,680
on the face of it it looks hard

02:37:04,160 --> 02:37:07,520
especially to a beginner there's not a

02:37:05,680 --> 02:37:08,240
lot of tutorials or examples out there

02:37:07,520 --> 02:37:11,040
at the moment

02:37:08,240 --> 02:37:12,319
and as we've seen what does exist is

02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:14,080
apple

02:37:12,319 --> 02:37:15,840
maybe there are paid for courses but

02:37:14,080 --> 02:37:16,560
that's no good to her maybe it becomes

02:37:15,840 --> 02:37:18,160
expensive

02:37:16,560 --> 02:37:20,319
you very quickly find articles telling

02:37:18,160 --> 02:37:21,040
you that you need an armed device to

02:37:20,319 --> 02:37:24,080
build arm

02:37:21,040 --> 02:37:24,800
on does that mean she has to buy the m1

02:37:24,080 --> 02:37:27,120
to develop

02:37:24,800 --> 02:37:28,399
desktop apps does that mean you have to

02:37:27,120 --> 02:37:30,080
build in the cloud

02:37:28,399 --> 02:37:32,479
is there no way around that or is there

02:37:30,080 --> 02:37:33,840
no way to build for arm on another

02:37:32,479 --> 02:37:36,080
architecture

02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:37,200
okay so he thinks okay okay okay this is

02:37:36,080 --> 02:37:38,479
a lot uh

02:37:37,200 --> 02:37:40,800
so she thinks let's just try and start

02:37:38,479 --> 02:37:43,439
at the bottom right arm is a company

02:37:40,800 --> 02:37:44,880
maybe they have a place to start okay

02:37:43,439 --> 02:37:48,720
good

02:37:44,880 --> 02:37:49,520
they do uh there's forums there's docs

02:37:48,720 --> 02:37:51,439
perfect

02:37:49,520 --> 02:37:53,280
so you have a scroll through but it's a

02:37:51,439 --> 02:37:54,640
lot about embedded stuff not necessarily

02:37:53,280 --> 02:37:55,520
applications but there's no need to

02:37:54,640 --> 02:37:57,680
panic

02:37:55,520 --> 02:37:58,880
there's a linux section okay it's not

02:37:57,680 --> 02:38:00,800
super helpful but

02:37:58,880 --> 02:38:04,000
right linux linux arm is still very

02:38:00,800 --> 02:38:07,200
embedded apps are a couple of layers up

02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:08,240
yes this is a good sign um have their

02:38:07,200 --> 02:38:10,080
docs ready

02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:11,439
there's a lot of debugging and docker

02:38:10,080 --> 02:38:13,920
but not so much

02:38:11,439 --> 02:38:16,160
for what she's looking for just yet so

02:38:13,920 --> 02:38:18,240
she she goes looking for linux apps

02:38:16,160 --> 02:38:20,000
and i'm pleased to say she found this

02:38:18,240 --> 02:38:22,240
conference when she was looking for

02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:24,080
for linux apps but since this talk is

02:38:22,240 --> 02:38:26,319
about linux apps for um let's

02:38:24,080 --> 02:38:28,399
let's focus over there and what i mean

02:38:26,319 --> 02:38:30,399
by that is when i've searched um

02:38:28,399 --> 02:38:31,760
for linux apps i found references to

02:38:30,399 --> 02:38:32,720
this conference so that's that's very

02:38:31,760 --> 02:38:36,479
very good

02:38:32,720 --> 02:38:39,439
uh so the first thing she finds is

02:38:36,479 --> 02:38:41,040
uh a reddit thread talking about ubuntu

02:38:39,439 --> 02:38:44,000
and i thank goodness for that since

02:38:41,040 --> 02:38:45,840
you know that's what i'm advocating for

02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:47,560
and then later on there is a thread on

02:38:45,840 --> 02:38:50,000
this website

02:38:47,560 --> 02:38:52,000
raspberrypi.org which is interesting she

02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:54,640
thinks maybe there's like a super active

02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:56,160
niche community for making baking apps

02:38:54,640 --> 02:38:58,720
yeah i know uh

02:38:56,160 --> 02:38:59,680
i know she would know about the

02:38:58,720 --> 02:39:01,120
raspberry pi

02:38:59,680 --> 02:39:02,800
unless she was living under a bridge but

02:39:01,120 --> 02:39:04,800
jokes about baked goods are fun and i'm

02:39:02,800 --> 02:39:11,040
pretty sure those guys like it

02:39:04,800 --> 02:39:14,399
uh so she thinks to herself

02:39:11,040 --> 02:39:16,319
can i do this can she do it can

02:39:14,399 --> 02:39:18,000
can you get ahead of this kind of curve

02:39:16,319 --> 02:39:20,399
and write applications for arm

02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:21,520
that will run on graviton and that will

02:39:20,399 --> 02:39:24,319
run on the

02:39:21,520 --> 02:39:25,120
the m1 chip apps that cater for the

02:39:24,319 --> 02:39:27,520
incoming

02:39:25,120 --> 02:39:28,319
um based future if if that if that

02:39:27,520 --> 02:39:30,319
happens

02:39:28,319 --> 02:39:31,520
maybe she can get ahead of the army arm

02:39:30,319 --> 02:39:33,280
apps ecosystem

02:39:31,520 --> 02:39:35,280
maybe she would make um the first class

02:39:33,280 --> 02:39:37,120
citizen of her app but of course

02:39:35,280 --> 02:39:38,800
build for build up and around on other

02:39:37,120 --> 02:39:40,479
architectures as well

02:39:38,800 --> 02:39:42,560
maybe she can even write tutorials and

02:39:40,479 --> 02:39:43,920
documentation and become something of an

02:39:42,560 --> 02:39:45,680
influencer in this space before it

02:39:43,920 --> 02:39:48,240
really even takes off

02:39:45,680 --> 02:39:49,520
it's safe to say i think that pretty

02:39:48,240 --> 02:39:52,640
soon arm-based

02:39:49,520 --> 02:39:54,479
hardware won't cost an arm and a leg and

02:39:52,640 --> 02:39:56,240
it doesn't even at the moment right and

02:39:54,479 --> 02:39:57,920
nvidia may well bring it to every

02:39:56,240 --> 02:40:00,960
developer on the planet

02:39:57,920 --> 02:40:02,319
in a not terribly distant future so can

02:40:00,960 --> 02:40:04,640
she do this

02:40:02,319 --> 02:40:05,680
spoiler alert for this fictitious talk

02:40:04,640 --> 02:40:06,960
she can

02:40:05,680 --> 02:40:09,439
but she needs to start making some

02:40:06,960 --> 02:40:09,439
decisions

02:40:09,920 --> 02:40:14,800
uh let's open some arm docs in tabs that

02:40:13,520 --> 02:40:16,800
will likely never close

02:40:14,800 --> 02:40:18,160
until our computer crashes and every

02:40:16,800 --> 02:40:20,880
other thing we find

02:40:18,160 --> 02:40:22,080
linked to all over the shop um ubuntu

02:40:20,880 --> 02:40:23,680
there are links to snapcraft and

02:40:22,080 --> 02:40:25,120
launchpad on the screen here

02:40:23,680 --> 02:40:27,520
but we'll get to that stuff later don't

02:40:25,120 --> 02:40:30,479
worry github raspberry pi

02:40:27,520 --> 02:40:31,040
okay so she thinks next let's get

02:40:30,479 --> 02:40:33,200
ourselves

02:40:31,040 --> 02:40:34,399
into the forums and over onto the

02:40:33,200 --> 02:40:36,720
youtubes

02:40:34,399 --> 02:40:38,399
maybe she spots this new arm software

02:40:36,720 --> 02:40:41,200
developers channel

02:40:38,399 --> 02:40:42,240
which you can see on screen here uh this

02:40:41,200 --> 02:40:43,600
is a neat

02:40:42,240 --> 02:40:45,520
little software developers youtube

02:40:43,600 --> 02:40:47,840
channel from the advocacy or the

02:40:45,520 --> 02:40:49,760
the developer relations teams over there

02:40:47,840 --> 02:40:51,600
at arm and it talks about what's going

02:40:49,760 --> 02:40:52,880
on with them what partners and community

02:40:51,600 --> 02:40:54,160
people are doing

02:40:52,880 --> 02:40:55,840
and what they're working on and most

02:40:54,160 --> 02:40:57,359
importantly it talks about developing

02:40:55,840 --> 02:40:59,120
software for arm

02:40:57,359 --> 02:41:00,399
they have a series on game development

02:40:59,120 --> 02:41:01,279
at the moment they do live streams it's

02:41:00,399 --> 02:41:03,120
pretty cool

02:41:01,279 --> 02:41:05,279
okay it doesn't matter i'm not okay

02:41:03,120 --> 02:41:07,200
anyway uh so she finds that

02:41:05,279 --> 02:41:08,880
uh that's a good thing that's good

02:41:07,200 --> 02:41:10,240
that's good interesting stuff that's arm

02:41:08,880 --> 02:41:11,600
support

02:41:10,240 --> 02:41:13,760
that's the arm knowledge taken into

02:41:11,600 --> 02:41:16,319
account and then

02:41:13,760 --> 02:41:17,840
she looks to learn more about um is nice

02:41:16,319 --> 02:41:20,160
and it's free and it's good and

02:41:17,840 --> 02:41:22,000
there are two images for r that's good

02:41:20,160 --> 02:41:23,120
for if she wants to to start developing

02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,800
natively

02:41:23,120 --> 02:41:26,800
she pops into the eventual discourse to

02:41:24,800 --> 02:41:28,399
see what's going on it's a very active

02:41:26,800 --> 02:41:29,680
discourse lots of people talking about

02:41:28,399 --> 02:41:31,439
lots of different things

02:41:29,680 --> 02:41:33,200
well there's not an arm specific section

02:41:31,439 --> 02:41:34,319
there is a desktop category where people

02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:36,399
talk every day

02:41:34,319 --> 02:41:37,840
and a community category which is where

02:41:36,399 --> 02:41:39,920
i live

02:41:37,840 --> 02:41:41,920
uh where she can raise her ideas and

02:41:39,920 --> 02:41:43,359
talk about what she wants to

02:41:41,920 --> 02:41:45,359
what she wants to do and how she wants

02:41:43,359 --> 02:41:48,160
to contribute

02:41:45,359 --> 02:41:49,920
right okay that's the architecture and

02:41:48,160 --> 02:41:51,760
linux taken care of

02:41:49,920 --> 02:41:53,200
but i think but there's something in

02:41:51,760 --> 02:41:55,760
between right

02:41:53,200 --> 02:41:56,880
uh okay good there is support for the

02:41:55,760 --> 02:41:59,279
baked goods

02:41:56,880 --> 02:42:00,479
in ubuntu that's good there is a

02:41:59,279 --> 02:42:03,760
raspberry pi support

02:42:00,479 --> 02:42:05,279
uh when she wants dessert i mean testing

02:42:03,760 --> 02:42:08,080
and there's a community here of

02:42:05,279 --> 02:42:10,399
developers to help with issues

02:42:08,080 --> 02:42:12,080
okay stepping back she's got ubuntu

02:42:10,399 --> 02:42:13,760
rusty pie

02:42:12,080 --> 02:42:15,680
yes and both of those things are in as

02:42:13,760 --> 02:42:18,479
expensive as it's going to get anyway so

02:42:15,680 --> 02:42:20,000
that's that's something and it's perfect

02:42:18,479 --> 02:42:23,200
for testing arm applications

02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:26,640
and there's printed support

02:42:23,200 --> 02:42:28,399
great we're ready to go reading around

02:42:26,640 --> 02:42:30,319
on ubuntu and getting up into one of

02:42:28,399 --> 02:42:31,359
raspberry pi she runs into these snap

02:42:30,319 --> 02:42:34,560
things

02:42:31,359 --> 02:42:37,359
she reads she reads she reads

02:42:34,560 --> 02:42:39,040
packaging write an app package it and

02:42:37,359 --> 02:42:40,080
build it to run on a heap of

02:42:39,040 --> 02:42:43,359
architectures

02:42:40,080 --> 02:42:45,359
including uh huh okay so you can do this

02:42:43,359 --> 02:42:46,720
she can see the path so she writes her

02:42:45,359 --> 02:42:49,920
stonker app

02:42:46,720 --> 02:42:55,840
yeah i remember it's called stonker

02:42:49,920 --> 02:42:55,840
okay like i said i'm not a

02:42:57,600 --> 02:43:06,479
developers on their apps etc but i'm not

02:43:01,520 --> 02:43:08,960
and everyone listens more than me

02:43:06,479 --> 02:43:08,960
i'm not going to

02:43:19,040 --> 02:43:22,880
and it's about done she's written

02:43:25,680 --> 02:43:30,000
okay so for the sake of this talk we'll

02:43:29,040 --> 02:43:32,080
say she used

02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:34,399
flutter just uh quickly for those who

02:43:32,080 --> 02:43:36,080
don't know photo flutter is a google

02:43:34,399 --> 02:43:37,600
a google's ui toolkit for building

02:43:36,080 --> 02:43:38,399
natively compiled applications for

02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:44,000
mobile web

02:43:38,399 --> 02:43:46,720
and desktop she's focused on arm

02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:48,479
but cross-platform and multi-platform

02:43:46,720 --> 02:43:50,479
support is always a win

02:43:48,479 --> 02:43:53,200
of course it could be some other nice

02:43:50,479 --> 02:43:53,200
crop cross

02:43:53,600 --> 02:43:57,279
it's uh maybe it's electron if you're

02:43:56,000 --> 02:44:00,479
interested in electron

02:43:57,279 --> 02:44:02,479
instead um i hope i'm saying

02:44:00,479 --> 02:44:04,160
your name right pradeep gave a very

02:44:02,479 --> 02:44:05,040
interesting talk on building apps with

02:44:04,160 --> 02:44:07,359
electron

02:44:05,040 --> 02:44:09,200
earlier earlier today i think that was

02:44:07,359 --> 02:44:10,720
today so maybe she would find that

02:44:09,200 --> 02:44:11,840
documentation instead it really doesn't

02:44:10,720 --> 02:44:13,439
matter

02:44:11,840 --> 02:44:15,279
let's see let's say she wrote it on on

02:44:13,439 --> 02:44:18,160
her ability workstation

02:44:15,279 --> 02:44:18,960
because come on i work for chronicle and

02:44:18,160 --> 02:44:22,720
she used

02:44:18,960 --> 02:44:23,920
a vs kodi no that's not uh that's codium

02:44:22,720 --> 02:44:25,840
not vs code

02:44:23,920 --> 02:44:28,080
kodi m is not a fork it's a repository

02:44:25,840 --> 02:44:31,120
of scripts to automatically build

02:44:28,080 --> 02:44:33,120
microsoft's vs code into freely licensed

02:44:31,120 --> 02:44:35,600
binaries with a community driven

02:44:33,120 --> 02:44:36,880
configuration uh you should absolutely

02:44:35,600 --> 02:44:38,800
check it out and just

02:44:36,880 --> 02:44:40,399
and just like that uh she's ready to go

02:44:38,800 --> 02:44:41,680
she can build a replication

02:44:40,399 --> 02:44:43,040
and get things going now i know i

02:44:41,680 --> 02:44:43,520
skipped over those two things quite

02:44:43,040 --> 02:44:45,760
quickly

02:44:43,520 --> 02:44:46,880
flutter and vs codium but like i said

02:44:45,760 --> 02:44:48,479
i'm not a developer

02:44:46,880 --> 02:44:51,680
and we're focused on the higher level

02:44:48,479 --> 02:44:53,200
sort of story journey here

02:44:51,680 --> 02:44:55,840
um there's more information about

02:44:53,200 --> 02:44:57,680
flutter on the ubuntu blog

02:44:55,840 --> 02:44:59,439
vs codium is a snap you can find in the

02:44:57,680 --> 02:45:01,600
snapstore and there's

02:44:59,439 --> 02:45:03,840
uh lots of talks at this conference

02:45:01,600 --> 02:45:05,600
alone that you could watch for example

02:45:03,840 --> 02:45:07,040
pradeep like i mentioned already

02:45:05,600 --> 02:45:09,439
mentioned um

02:45:07,040 --> 02:45:11,840
or maybe tobias's talk at the very very

02:45:09,439 --> 02:45:15,040
beginning on adaptive apps with gtk

02:45:11,840 --> 02:45:16,880
so lots of options i'm not recommending

02:45:15,040 --> 02:45:19,040
necessarily these things it's just

02:45:16,880 --> 02:45:21,439
these are the options that um that i

02:45:19,040 --> 02:45:24,640
would have gone for let's say

02:45:21,439 --> 02:45:26,479
so we have stonker on github maybe i

02:45:24,640 --> 02:45:28,240
shouldn't have called it stonker

02:45:26,479 --> 02:45:30,720
it's an open source project because of

02:45:28,240 --> 02:45:33,040
course it is and maybe it has one or two

02:45:30,720 --> 02:45:34,319
other contributors who helped her out in

02:45:33,040 --> 02:45:36,880
the forums

02:45:34,319 --> 02:45:38,640
okay great but really that's the fun

02:45:36,880 --> 02:45:42,240
part the fun part done right

02:45:38,640 --> 02:45:45,439
the bulk of the work is done oh dear

02:45:42,240 --> 02:45:46,800
uh she thinks deploying linux haps

02:45:45,439 --> 02:45:48,800
is she going to start thinking about

02:45:46,800 --> 02:45:51,600
packaging now okay okay

02:45:48,800 --> 02:45:52,720
she holds her breath and she dives it

02:45:51,600 --> 02:45:54,560
but of course not

02:45:52,720 --> 02:45:56,240
helpful commentary starts to get a

02:45:54,560 --> 02:45:57,840
little bit less responsive

02:45:56,240 --> 02:45:58,880
linux apps are great that's why we're

02:45:57,840 --> 02:46:00,800
all here right that's why this

02:45:58,880 --> 02:46:05,040
conference is named after them

02:46:00,800 --> 02:46:07,520
linux packaging is typically less great

02:46:05,040 --> 02:46:09,279
she finds a lot about how to package

02:46:07,520 --> 02:46:12,479
your software a lot of toxicity

02:46:09,279 --> 02:46:15,600
a lot of options of course um why can't

02:46:12,479 --> 02:46:18,640
you just compile a linux binary

02:46:15,600 --> 02:46:19,600
yeah no okay maybe she can get it into

02:46:18,640 --> 02:46:21,200
the curve

02:46:19,600 --> 02:46:23,120
no that's silly as well we've all heard

02:46:21,200 --> 02:46:25,920
linuses talk about that by now

02:46:23,120 --> 02:46:27,200
so we run into a hurdle right we want to

02:46:25,920 --> 02:46:29,200
build this thing for linux

02:46:27,200 --> 02:46:31,760
because obviously and we want to build

02:46:29,200 --> 02:46:33,680
it for r for the reasons we've discussed

02:46:31,760 --> 02:46:36,880
but of course there's more than on is a

02:46:33,680 --> 02:46:40,240
bonus but arm is what we want

02:46:36,880 --> 02:46:41,680
so she starts to flounder handcuffed or

02:46:40,240 --> 02:46:44,319
restrained by choice

02:46:41,680 --> 02:46:44,800
what does she choose rpm flat pack app

02:46:44,319 --> 02:46:47,840
image

02:46:44,800 --> 02:46:47,840
snap deb

02:46:48,080 --> 02:46:51,600
she reads up she finds some pretty good

02:46:49,760 --> 02:46:52,800
documentation for each format

02:46:51,600 --> 02:46:55,040
communities who are definitely

02:46:52,800 --> 02:46:56,800
passionate about what they're doing

02:46:55,040 --> 02:46:58,240
but the days start ticking by she

02:46:56,800 --> 02:46:59,840
doesn't want to pick one

02:46:58,240 --> 02:47:02,640
and then regret it she's an app

02:46:59,840 --> 02:47:04,960
developer right not a software packager

02:47:02,640 --> 02:47:06,319
it looks like this is another call to

02:47:04,960 --> 02:47:09,120
action for me to

02:47:06,319 --> 02:47:10,560
everyone just in the future or live

02:47:09,120 --> 02:47:12,080
because i want to be

02:47:10,560 --> 02:47:13,840
uh right on the nose with this one i'll

02:47:12,080 --> 02:47:14,640
just sort of say it we have a lot of

02:47:13,840 --> 02:47:17,760
baggage

02:47:14,640 --> 02:47:20,640
in the linux app ecosystem everyone's

02:47:17,760 --> 02:47:22,240
uh talks over the past few days that

02:47:20,640 --> 02:47:22,960
i've seen at least have been really

02:47:22,240 --> 02:47:24,479
interesting

02:47:22,960 --> 02:47:26,319
in improving the experience of learning

02:47:24,479 --> 02:47:27,439
how to do things better or more

02:47:26,319 --> 02:47:29,840
efficiently

02:47:27,439 --> 02:47:33,120
but not a lot to address the that i've

02:47:29,840 --> 02:47:35,439
seen a lot to address the baggage

02:47:33,120 --> 02:47:36,960
when it comes to packaging now of course

02:47:35,439 --> 02:47:38,479
this presentation is going to go in a

02:47:36,960 --> 02:47:40,240
certain packaging direction

02:47:38,479 --> 02:47:41,520
and i'm not here to start fights what we

02:47:40,240 --> 02:47:43,359
need is a sort of

02:47:41,520 --> 02:47:45,279
objective measurement of what packaging

02:47:43,359 --> 02:47:46,840
is best for use cases

02:47:45,279 --> 02:47:48,319
and then work on that sort of wider

02:47:46,840 --> 02:47:51,520
support okay

02:47:48,319 --> 02:47:53,680
i touch on this again um later but if

02:47:51,520 --> 02:47:56,560
representatives of packaging formats

02:47:53,680 --> 02:47:58,080
want the uh the winter community team

02:47:56,560 --> 02:47:58,640
then i am a part of would love to sort

02:47:58,080 --> 02:48:01,680
of

02:47:58,640 --> 02:48:04,640
join the discussion anyway right she's

02:48:01,680 --> 02:48:05,840
in this whole this packaging hole right

02:48:04,640 --> 02:48:09,439
enter plot twist

02:48:05,840 --> 02:48:12,319
number two hopefully enter one of

02:48:09,439 --> 02:48:13,120
you folks she drops her concern in a

02:48:12,319 --> 02:48:14,880
forum

02:48:13,120 --> 02:48:17,439
it doesn't matter where she just drops

02:48:14,880 --> 02:48:18,160
it in a form and lo and behold a trusted

02:48:17,439 --> 02:48:20,560
advisor

02:48:18,160 --> 02:48:22,640
a community leader maybe one of you good

02:48:20,560 --> 02:48:26,000
folks responds

02:48:22,640 --> 02:48:26,000
with something like this

02:48:29,680 --> 02:48:32,960
very the options can be good and they're

02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:36,240
all good for

02:48:32,960 --> 02:48:36,240
reasons just remember

02:48:36,720 --> 02:48:40,640
it's that it's the app that matters and

02:48:38,960 --> 02:48:42,160
thanks for writing it for linux

02:48:40,640 --> 02:48:44,080
so what are your goals what's your use

02:48:42,160 --> 02:48:46,720
case and we'll see what packaging is

02:48:44,080 --> 02:48:46,720
right for you

02:48:47,120 --> 02:48:51,279
link blink thank you anonymous community

02:48:49,760 --> 02:48:54,560
leader

02:48:51,279 --> 02:48:55,760
and so she wants this to work on linux

02:48:54,560 --> 02:48:57,040
but most importantly she wants it to

02:48:55,760 --> 02:48:59,040
work

02:48:57,040 --> 02:49:00,319
so the packaging has to have arm support

02:48:59,040 --> 02:49:02,080
she wants it to become a thing

02:49:00,319 --> 02:49:03,359
and keep developing so she wants to have

02:49:02,080 --> 02:49:07,040
easy way to update it

02:49:03,359 --> 02:49:09,920
and of course security is important too

02:49:07,040 --> 02:49:11,439
it is so this community leader is going

02:49:09,920 --> 02:49:14,319
to recommend to her

02:49:11,439 --> 02:49:16,160
snaps because again of course they are

02:49:14,319 --> 02:49:18,399
but let me reiterate the packaging isn't

02:49:16,160 --> 02:49:20,720
is less important than the app here

02:49:18,399 --> 02:49:22,319
plus my friend and colleague igor gave a

02:49:20,720 --> 02:49:23,359
nice talk about snaps earlier in the

02:49:22,319 --> 02:49:26,800
event

02:49:23,359 --> 02:49:29,120
yesterday afternoon afternoon for me

02:49:26,800 --> 02:49:30,160
so you'll all know all about them by now

02:49:29,120 --> 02:49:32,399
and they're pretty cool and they're a

02:49:30,160 --> 02:49:35,920
nice fit for this u-case

02:49:32,399 --> 02:49:37,279
so she gets into the docks here we go

02:49:35,920 --> 02:49:39,200
there's a lot of documentation around

02:49:37,279 --> 02:49:40,080
snapping an app snapping a flutter app

02:49:39,200 --> 02:49:41,840
specifically

02:49:40,080 --> 02:49:44,800
and some nice articles written by some

02:49:41,840 --> 02:49:46,880
first timers that one's by me

02:49:44,800 --> 02:49:48,640
uh she learns that snapping an app for

02:49:46,880 --> 02:49:51,120
arm is not only possible

02:49:48,640 --> 02:49:52,960
but is already being done all over the

02:49:51,120 --> 02:49:55,760
snap ecosystem

02:49:52,960 --> 02:49:56,960
uh quick uh digression again here just

02:49:55,760 --> 02:49:58,800
in case you don't know

02:49:56,960 --> 02:50:01,040
snaps are application containers that

02:49:58,800 --> 02:50:03,279
bundle libraries and dependencies

02:50:01,040 --> 02:50:05,680
inside themselves you can integrate

02:50:03,279 --> 02:50:07,120
packaging snaps with your cicd pipelines

02:50:05,680 --> 02:50:08,479
you can take advantage of the statcraft

02:50:07,120 --> 02:50:09,520
extension for specific kinds of

02:50:08,479 --> 02:50:11,760
middleware

02:50:09,520 --> 02:50:13,279
um i knew i know i actually know a

02:50:11,760 --> 02:50:16,000
couple of folks who build

02:50:13,279 --> 02:50:17,040
uh ross robotic operating system snaps

02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:19,520
for their robots

02:50:17,040 --> 02:50:20,160
um and once the application is snapped

02:50:19,520 --> 02:50:22,880
it can be

02:50:20,160 --> 02:50:24,720
available on the store to run on any

02:50:22,880 --> 02:50:26,080
links distributed that runs snap system

02:50:24,720 --> 02:50:27,359
d

02:50:26,080 --> 02:50:30,640
and so that it can be kept up to date

02:50:27,359 --> 02:50:33,680
and maintained and promoted and so on

02:50:30,640 --> 02:50:34,399
okay next she would have to write her

02:50:33,680 --> 02:50:36,560
yaml

02:50:34,399 --> 02:50:38,319
this is effectively the snap itself it's

02:50:36,560 --> 02:50:39,600
where all the plugs and interfaces get

02:50:38,319 --> 02:50:41,040
added

02:50:39,600 --> 02:50:43,680
and where you can make the app strictly

02:50:41,040 --> 02:50:44,720
confined this comes from the early days

02:50:43,680 --> 02:50:47,279
when stats were built

02:50:44,720 --> 02:50:49,040
and designed for iot devices and to run

02:50:47,279 --> 02:50:51,840
on embedded architectures like

02:50:49,040 --> 02:50:53,760
like a phone this strict confinement is

02:50:51,840 --> 02:50:54,240
what gives stats their sort of container

02:50:53,760 --> 02:50:57,760
nature

02:50:54,240 --> 02:50:59,680
so where lxc or something of that

02:50:57,760 --> 02:51:01,520
elk could be seen as a sort of machine

02:50:59,680 --> 02:51:02,880
container a docker

02:51:01,520 --> 02:51:05,200
container could be seen as a sort of

02:51:02,880 --> 02:51:06,720
process container a snap can be seen as

02:51:05,200 --> 02:51:08,640
sort of an application container right

02:51:06,720 --> 02:51:12,240
the package code and dependencies

02:51:08,640 --> 02:51:15,520
like i mentioned before into and sort of

02:51:12,240 --> 02:51:15,520
isolated and immutable

02:51:17,600 --> 02:51:21,279
as that's sort of isolated and immutable

02:51:19,600 --> 02:51:22,240
with a writable area separated from the

02:51:21,279 --> 02:51:24,640
rest of the system

02:51:22,240 --> 02:51:25,359
but visible to the host and now i'm not

02:51:24,640 --> 02:51:27,120
going to go

02:51:25,359 --> 02:51:29,600
and keep giving the spiel and selling

02:51:27,120 --> 02:51:30,840
snaps but you can be sure they're

02:51:29,600 --> 02:51:32,800
they're a good choice for our

02:51:30,840 --> 02:51:35,840
applications especially

02:51:32,800 --> 02:51:38,160
one like stonker so she makes a song

02:51:35,840 --> 02:51:40,240
strictly confined because why not she

02:51:38,160 --> 02:51:41,520
gets his security is important

02:51:40,240 --> 02:51:43,040
i know i've heard it from lots of folks

02:51:41,520 --> 02:51:44,640
in this security is important she gets

02:51:43,040 --> 02:51:47,120
right

02:51:44,640 --> 02:51:48,640
and we move on to the next line uh and

02:51:47,120 --> 02:51:50,880
so and then she builds it remotely

02:51:48,640 --> 02:51:52,399
so this is a snap grab feature that lets

02:51:50,880 --> 02:51:54,399
you build on someone else's computer

02:51:52,399 --> 02:51:55,680
it's a super nifty and easy way

02:51:54,399 --> 02:51:57,520
if you want to actually do things with

02:51:55,680 --> 02:51:58,240
your computer while things build and it

02:51:57,520 --> 02:52:00,720
doesn't take up

02:51:58,240 --> 02:52:01,840
all your resources everything's built on

02:52:00,720 --> 02:52:03,200
launchpad so

02:52:01,840 --> 02:52:05,600
you can drain that canonical

02:52:03,200 --> 02:52:07,600
infrastructure instead of your own um

02:52:05,600 --> 02:52:09,200
there's sometimes a cube but rarely uh

02:52:07,600 --> 02:52:12,080
does it take that long

02:52:09,200 --> 02:52:13,200
take that long anyway okay so let's say

02:52:12,080 --> 02:52:15,840
her build works

02:52:13,200 --> 02:52:18,080
it's good it spits out numerous images

02:52:15,840 --> 02:52:20,319
including an amd 64 image

02:52:18,080 --> 02:52:22,080
an arm image uh she tries it on her

02:52:20,319 --> 02:52:22,800
laptop she tries the md64 image on her

02:52:22,080 --> 02:52:24,880
laptop

02:52:22,800 --> 02:52:26,240
okay that one works but that's not what

02:52:24,880 --> 02:52:28,560
she cares about right

02:52:26,240 --> 02:52:30,160
what she cares about is the arm

02:52:28,560 --> 02:52:33,680
architecture

02:52:30,160 --> 02:52:36,800
as we have discussed um

02:52:33,680 --> 02:52:37,680
so she fires up ubuntu on her raspberry

02:52:36,800 --> 02:52:40,160
pi 400

02:52:37,680 --> 02:52:41,120
as you can see on the slide here okay it

02:52:40,160 --> 02:52:43,840
works there too

02:52:41,120 --> 02:52:44,960
she installs it it runs she tests it

02:52:43,840 --> 02:52:47,920
it's good

02:52:44,960 --> 02:52:49,040
not just the 400 of course ubuntu server

02:52:47,920 --> 02:52:51,439
is certified

02:52:49,040 --> 02:52:53,279
to work uh on all the raspberry pi's

02:52:51,439 --> 02:52:56,560
with a higher version number than two

02:52:53,279 --> 02:52:59,840
and a bluetooth desktop desktop works um

02:52:56,560 --> 02:53:01,200
grand on pi400s and

02:52:59,840 --> 02:53:02,880
naturally the desktop means the four

02:53:01,200 --> 02:53:06,000
gigabyte model minimum

02:53:02,880 --> 02:53:07,840
but it but it works uh little

02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:10,160
sort of side note there because i worked

02:53:07,840 --> 02:53:13,600
on that stuff um

02:53:10,160 --> 02:53:17,760
uh where was i

02:53:13,600 --> 02:53:19,840
uh okay so we've so she can get herself

02:53:17,760 --> 02:53:20,960
on this accessible um hardware raspberry

02:53:19,840 --> 02:53:22,960
pi recipe for 400

02:53:20,960 --> 02:53:24,000
whatever it is and she's confident

02:53:22,960 --> 02:53:26,399
because there's two communities

02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:27,040
around it ubuntu and raspberry pi that

02:53:26,399 --> 02:53:28,479
will work

02:53:27,040 --> 02:53:30,240
and she'll be should be able to test

02:53:28,479 --> 02:53:31,920
these things uh

02:53:30,240 --> 02:53:33,600
if they're not developed natively

02:53:31,920 --> 02:53:35,040
because she'd be able to do the remote

02:53:33,600 --> 02:53:36,399
build system which will build alarm or

02:53:35,040 --> 02:53:39,200
she could test natively

02:53:36,399 --> 02:53:40,880
so she kicks the tires she makes sure

02:53:39,200 --> 02:53:42,240
that everything she wants the app to do

02:53:40,880 --> 02:53:44,399
works

02:53:42,240 --> 02:53:45,920
good maybe she gets in touch with uh

02:53:44,399 --> 02:53:47,439
with me or one of my colleagues to talk

02:53:45,920 --> 02:53:49,680
about testing we've run

02:53:47,439 --> 02:53:51,279
testing days and recent history of uh

02:53:49,680 --> 02:53:53,600
for the abutua images themselves there's

02:53:51,279 --> 02:53:55,760
no reason she couldn't if she wanted to

02:53:53,600 --> 02:53:58,080
start map testers threat herself or

02:53:55,760 --> 02:53:59,760
group and crack on with some sweet sweet

02:53:58,080 --> 02:54:02,479
application testing

02:53:59,760 --> 02:54:03,680
and she goes she goes to the snap store

02:54:02,479 --> 02:54:07,040
and she reserves the name

02:54:03,680 --> 02:54:09,120
stonker starting to regret the name and

02:54:07,040 --> 02:54:12,640
she builds for every architecture she

02:54:09,120 --> 02:54:15,359
sends them to the global snap store

02:54:12,640 --> 02:54:16,319
next slide she hooks it up to her get

02:54:15,359 --> 02:54:19,200
her repo

02:54:16,319 --> 02:54:21,359
with a few clickety clacks such that

02:54:19,200 --> 02:54:23,200
every time she pushes to her github repo

02:54:21,359 --> 02:54:25,600
it triggered it triggers

02:54:23,200 --> 02:54:27,200
a new build that is pushed to the store

02:54:25,600 --> 02:54:28,000
that could be straight to her stonker

02:54:27,200 --> 02:54:29,520
users

02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:31,279
or to another channel for personal

02:54:29,520 --> 02:54:32,160
testing or her community testing that

02:54:31,279 --> 02:54:35,279
she's now

02:54:32,160 --> 02:54:39,359
set up and she is going with

02:54:35,279 --> 02:54:40,960
good sigh so she sits back

02:54:39,359 --> 02:54:42,160
but then she sits back up again right

02:54:40,960 --> 02:54:43,040
because of what i was talking about

02:54:42,160 --> 02:54:44,960
before

02:54:43,040 --> 02:54:46,880
she makes her snap landing page look

02:54:44,960 --> 02:54:47,680
nice she writes a blog post about her

02:54:46,880 --> 02:54:49,600
experience

02:54:47,680 --> 02:54:51,359
she links to the snap landing page and

02:54:49,600 --> 02:54:52,640
the documentation that she found and the

02:54:51,359 --> 02:54:55,200
sites that she found and

02:54:52,640 --> 02:54:55,760
it really starts to build this starts to

02:54:55,200 --> 02:54:58,800
build this

02:54:55,760 --> 02:55:01,040
this hyperlink trail what a paper

02:54:58,800 --> 02:55:03,760
trailer hyperlink trim

02:55:01,040 --> 02:55:04,319
um then because again she wants to do

02:55:03,760 --> 02:55:06,479
this

02:55:04,319 --> 02:55:07,760
properly she pops into the snapcraft

02:55:06,479 --> 02:55:09,279
forum about

02:55:07,760 --> 02:55:11,680
uh about and she talks about what she's

02:55:09,279 --> 02:55:14,240
done i see it me

02:55:11,680 --> 02:55:16,319
rhys um i put it up there on the

02:55:14,240 --> 02:55:19,279
featured snap section on the snap store

02:55:16,319 --> 02:55:20,960
because it's a pretty damn cool app and

02:55:19,279 --> 02:55:23,120
it goes up a few hundred users maybe a

02:55:20,960 --> 02:55:26,000
few thousand users

02:55:23,120 --> 02:55:27,279
and how hold the phone he thinks to

02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:30,479
herself

02:55:27,279 --> 02:55:33,040
is that it right let's check

02:55:30,479 --> 02:55:34,319
let's check let's check she has her app

02:55:33,040 --> 02:55:37,200
it's open source

02:55:34,319 --> 02:55:38,720
it's hosted on github nice there are a

02:55:37,200 --> 02:55:41,279
couple of contributors because

02:55:38,720 --> 02:55:41,760
along the way uh she found people in the

02:55:41,279 --> 02:55:43,680
forum

02:55:41,760 --> 02:55:45,040
but she can always call for more

02:55:43,680 --> 02:55:46,960
contributions and

02:55:45,040 --> 02:55:48,800
she's in the right forms now it's just a

02:55:46,960 --> 02:55:50,399
matter of hopefully it's just a matter

02:55:48,800 --> 02:55:52,000
of putting out the uh putting the word

02:55:50,399 --> 02:55:53,600
out there

02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:55,439
her github repo is hooked up to

02:55:53,600 --> 02:55:58,240
snapcraft so we can keep

02:55:55,439 --> 02:55:59,200
so she can keep her app up to date she

02:55:58,240 --> 02:56:01,520
can trigger builds

02:55:59,200 --> 02:56:02,880
for all of the architectures that that's

02:56:01,520 --> 02:56:05,920
relevant to her

02:56:02,880 --> 02:56:07,520
and each time we can do each time we do

02:56:05,920 --> 02:56:08,240
we can install the snap on our raspberry

02:56:07,520 --> 02:56:11,120
pi

02:56:08,240 --> 02:56:12,319
keep the tires test it works order the

02:56:11,120 --> 02:56:13,920
whole process

02:56:12,319 --> 02:56:16,319
from the beginning on a raspberry pi in

02:56:13,920 --> 02:56:19,439
the first place anyway

02:56:16,319 --> 02:56:21,920
huh did she just arm herself with a

02:56:19,439 --> 02:56:23,840
linux app

02:56:21,920 --> 02:56:25,520
and did she just contribute an app to

02:56:23,840 --> 02:56:27,359
the linux ecosystem

02:56:25,520 --> 02:56:29,600
that is going to be able to run on the

02:56:27,359 --> 02:56:31,520
nvidia r developer hardware of the

02:56:29,600 --> 02:56:35,760
future

02:56:31,520 --> 02:56:37,840
i think you did now if you go through

02:56:35,760 --> 02:56:39,120
this whole process of building your app

02:56:37,840 --> 02:56:41,359
already

02:56:39,120 --> 02:56:42,319
and it already exists you really didn't

02:56:41,359 --> 02:56:44,640
need to listen

02:56:42,319 --> 02:56:45,760
to most of my presentation but if you

02:56:44,640 --> 02:56:48,960
have similar goals

02:56:45,760 --> 02:56:50,240
to our protagonist update ability cost

02:56:48,960 --> 02:56:52,319
district support

02:56:50,240 --> 02:56:53,520
arm support for the new world on the

02:56:52,319 --> 02:56:55,359
horizon

02:56:53,520 --> 02:56:56,800
uh you you could you should check out

02:56:55,359 --> 02:57:00,960
snaps tube

02:56:56,800 --> 02:57:04,240
uh give yourself a hand and an arm

02:57:00,960 --> 02:57:05,760
arm support for uh applications i think

02:57:04,240 --> 02:57:06,840
is going to be crucial for reaching out

02:57:05,760 --> 02:57:10,560
to users

02:57:06,840 --> 02:57:11,520
both but not just uh crucial for getting

02:57:10,560 --> 02:57:14,640
new users

02:57:11,520 --> 02:57:18,240
but it could be an opportunity for linux

02:57:14,640 --> 02:57:22,080
the linux ecosystem in general right um

02:57:18,240 --> 02:57:23,680
naturally there was a lot of snaps in

02:57:22,080 --> 02:57:25,279
this presentation and while snaps have a

02:57:23,680 --> 02:57:27,439
lot of benefits and pros especially when

02:57:25,279 --> 02:57:30,319
building for arm architectures

02:57:27,439 --> 02:57:31,680
especially for security and updatability

02:57:30,319 --> 02:57:33,200
of course there are there are the

02:57:31,680 --> 02:57:35,359
weights we've heard lots about

02:57:33,200 --> 02:57:36,399
flat pack quite lots about um we've

02:57:35,359 --> 02:57:39,520
heard lots about a lot

02:57:36,399 --> 02:57:42,720
this these past few days so again

02:57:39,520 --> 02:57:47,840
um think back to the trusted advisor the

02:57:42,720 --> 02:57:50,880
leader mentioned who appears to talk

02:57:47,840 --> 02:57:50,880
a powerful quote

02:57:51,530 --> 02:57:54,599
[Music]

02:58:03,120 --> 02:58:10,000
next slide in summary uh highlight

02:58:06,560 --> 02:58:10,720
uh here were three things despite

02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:12,720
everything

02:58:10,720 --> 02:58:13,920
like this and the work everyone at this

02:58:12,720 --> 02:58:18,479
conference does

02:58:13,920 --> 02:58:18,479
apps on linux i'm sure everyone knows

02:58:23,439 --> 02:58:28,560
or a blog tutorial or even do a video

02:58:26,080 --> 02:58:33,520
about app development

02:58:28,560 --> 02:58:33,520
a moment to think about the

02:58:43,120 --> 02:58:47,760
look at those more we all can and we all

02:58:47,200 --> 02:58:50,160
should

02:58:47,760 --> 02:58:50,160
do this

02:58:52,319 --> 02:58:56,640
trying to beat the algorithm or get the

02:58:54,479 --> 02:58:58,479
seo in there like i mentioned earlier

02:58:56,640 --> 02:59:00,880
but it means sign posting where to get

02:58:58,479 --> 02:59:03,680
started right how can we be

02:59:00,880 --> 02:59:04,479
able to join our linux app community

02:59:03,680 --> 02:59:08,240
highway

02:59:04,479 --> 02:59:08,240
if they can't find the online

02:59:10,319 --> 02:59:15,760
next packages software packaging

02:59:13,439 --> 02:59:16,960
brings with it a lot of questions and

02:59:15,760 --> 02:59:20,640
now i don't

02:59:16,960 --> 02:59:22,640
do the poopoo

02:59:20,640 --> 02:59:23,920
packaging i like that like i've said the

02:59:22,640 --> 02:59:27,520
technology

02:59:23,920 --> 02:59:29,680
i spent all of about a month uh at

02:59:27,520 --> 02:59:31,279
as a snap advocate before i was moved to

02:59:29,680 --> 02:59:34,880
the community

02:59:31,279 --> 02:59:37,120
people this was not an internal thing

02:59:34,880 --> 02:59:38,800
uh in that time i snapped some things i

02:59:37,120 --> 02:59:40,560
wrote about snapping i learned

02:59:38,800 --> 02:59:43,120
about limitations and i learned about

02:59:40,560 --> 02:59:43,600
packaging now as i say the technology is

02:59:43,120 --> 02:59:46,399
great

02:59:43,600 --> 02:59:47,439
really interesting and super useful but

02:59:46,399 --> 02:59:50,479
the drama

02:59:47,439 --> 02:59:51,680
is uh less so there are some wonderful

02:59:50,479 --> 02:59:53,200
people in the community who are

02:59:51,680 --> 02:59:55,840
incredibly constructive

02:59:53,200 --> 02:59:56,640
and helpful and who get it and i've

02:59:55,840 --> 02:59:59,120
virtually

02:59:56,640 --> 03:00:01,520
messaged numbers of them here at this

02:59:59,120 --> 03:00:02,960
conference and it's been great

03:00:01,520 --> 03:00:04,800
and there are people who talk about

03:00:02,960 --> 03:00:07,279
packaging software like it's an

03:00:04,800 --> 03:00:09,439
extremist branch of a religion

03:00:07,279 --> 03:00:11,920
now far be it from me to wade into those

03:00:09,439 --> 03:00:13,920
waters any more than i already have

03:00:11,920 --> 03:00:14,960
but for the sake of the linux app

03:00:13,920 --> 03:00:16,399
ecosystem

03:00:14,960 --> 03:00:18,000
i think we need to find a better way to

03:00:16,399 --> 03:00:21,040
deal with these

03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:24,399
issues if you have ideas let me know

03:00:21,040 --> 03:00:27,040
maybe we can start a movement

03:00:24,399 --> 03:00:28,800
and third and finally we have i think we

03:00:27,040 --> 03:00:30,640
have a unique opportunity

03:00:28,800 --> 03:00:31,840
with the coming of more linux compatible

03:00:30,640 --> 03:00:34,880
mainstream

03:00:31,840 --> 03:00:35,520
um arm hardware to solve both of these

03:00:34,880 --> 03:00:39,040
issues

03:00:35,520 --> 03:00:41,120
and get ahead of the game as a brit

03:00:39,040 --> 03:00:42,800
i've been following the acquisition of

03:00:41,120 --> 03:00:47,359
arm with a keen eye

03:00:42,800 --> 03:00:48,720
the pros and cons are of course enormous

03:00:47,359 --> 03:00:50,800
and one way or the other there's going

03:00:48,720 --> 03:00:52,160
to be a lasting impact on arm and the

03:00:50,800 --> 03:00:55,279
general hardware landscape

03:00:52,160 --> 03:00:58,880
that's out there if it goes ahead

03:00:55,279 --> 03:01:02,560
in theory possibly just possibly

03:00:58,880 --> 03:01:05,200
there is a huge opportunity uh

03:01:02,560 --> 03:01:06,000
to regroup and the kicks to kick linux

03:01:05,200 --> 03:01:08,080
apps into a new

03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:10,160
gear there's a lot of possibility but if

03:01:08,080 --> 03:01:12,000
we if we use this opportunity to get

03:01:10,160 --> 03:01:14,399
some semblance of coherency

03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:16,240
give linux applications common ground

03:01:14,399 --> 03:01:18,640
get them out there ahead of the pack

03:01:16,240 --> 03:01:19,680
people new developers all developers

03:01:18,640 --> 03:01:22,479
might take notice

03:01:19,680 --> 03:01:23,040
hey i know folks at nvidia renault will

03:01:22,479 --> 03:01:25,279
see this

03:01:23,040 --> 03:01:27,920
they take notice themselves but it's up

03:01:25,279 --> 03:01:28,960
to linux app developers folks like you

03:01:27,920 --> 03:01:33,040
guys

03:01:28,960 --> 03:01:36,560
and girls apologies you folks you people

03:01:33,040 --> 03:01:39,840
people watching and to make it happen

03:01:36,560 --> 03:01:43,200
again if you have any ideas um

03:01:39,840 --> 03:01:45,600
i'd like to hear them we can start a

on screen and the ubuntu discourse

03:02:26,800 --> 03:02:30,080
because we have some interesting things

03:02:28,240 --> 03:02:32,399
going in the ubuntu community

03:02:30,080 --> 03:02:33,520

all of the organizers

03:02:37,200 --> 03:02:41,600
of the linux app summit on behalf of

03:02:39,520 --> 03:02:44,399
myself and also on behalf of

03:02:41,600 --> 03:02:46,399
canonical for doing such a tremendous

03:02:44,399 --> 03:02:48,720
job and keeping on top of everything

03:02:46,399 --> 03:02:50,240
i've been looking in the organizers

03:02:48,720 --> 03:02:50,880
telegram channel throughout the whole

03:02:50,240 --> 03:02:52,399
thing

03:02:50,880 --> 03:02:54,319
and everything has been handled quickly

03:02:52,399 --> 03:02:58,160
and well to keep everything moving

03:02:54,319 --> 03:02:58,800
so like um like karen sandler said on

03:02:58,160 --> 03:03:00,960
the day

03:02:58,800 --> 03:03:01,840
one i'd like to give i'd like i hope

03:03:00,960 --> 03:03:04,800
everyone can give

03:03:01,840 --> 03:03:07,200
a silent applause for such a good uh

03:03:04,800 --> 03:03:07,200
event

03:03:09,680 --> 03:03:13,920
to the shared notes yeah that's it thank

03:03:12,319 --> 03:03:16,160
you

03:03:13,920 --> 03:03:17,840
no problem uh what apps do you think are

03:03:16,160 --> 03:03:18,800
ideal for new beginning developers to

03:03:17,840 --> 03:03:20,399
convert

03:03:18,800 --> 03:03:22,319
or create either existing apps or

03:03:20,399 --> 03:03:25,279
general classes of apps

03:03:22,319 --> 03:03:26,960
um so since we're at the linux app

03:03:25,279 --> 03:03:27,760
summit i'll i'll stick to desktop

03:03:26,960 --> 03:03:30,720
applications

03:03:27,760 --> 03:03:31,680
but the the the best ones are the

03:03:30,720 --> 03:03:34,720
simplest ones

03:03:31,680 --> 03:03:38,000
i think for getting started the first um

03:03:34,720 --> 03:03:39,439
application uh so i've

03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:40,960
i wanted to get into application

03:03:39,439 --> 03:03:43,120
development a long time ago and i found

03:03:40,960 --> 03:03:45,200
sort of no code tools and things to

03:03:43,120 --> 03:03:47,120
to get things going before i before i

03:03:45,200 --> 03:03:49,680
found the the kool-aid

03:03:47,120 --> 03:03:51,520
um and the best things i think to start

03:03:49,680 --> 03:03:54,160
with are the really really simple things

03:03:51,520 --> 03:03:55,600
that you can make um that maybe that

03:03:54,160 --> 03:03:57,279
would may be fragmented that you don't

03:03:55,600 --> 03:03:58,240
expect to make lots of noise or make

03:03:57,279 --> 03:03:59,920
lots of noise about

03:03:58,240 --> 03:04:01,920
something like stonker that you know you

03:03:59,920 --> 03:04:03,279
would use even if it's not the best

03:04:01,920 --> 03:04:04,000
thing ever because it doesn't really

03:04:03,279 --> 03:04:05,840
matter

03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:08,000
so maybe something like a note taking

03:04:05,840 --> 03:04:09,840
app a very very simple note-taking app

03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:12,880
or a very very simple

03:04:09,840 --> 03:04:14,319
very very simple timer

03:04:12,880 --> 03:04:16,080
you know something something that you

03:04:14,319 --> 03:04:17,680
can do natively and you can you can get

03:04:16,080 --> 03:04:19,840
your wheels turning

03:04:17,680 --> 03:04:21,359
something you could use even if no one

03:04:19,840 --> 03:04:23,920
else would use it just because

03:04:21,359 --> 03:04:26,640
even you know and then write about it

03:04:23,920 --> 03:04:28,000
then talk about how you experienced

03:04:26,640 --> 03:04:29,680
how you how what the experience was like

03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:31,040
for you and then tell me about it and

03:04:29,680 --> 03:04:34,080
socialize it and

03:04:31,040 --> 03:04:36,560
have a great time um

03:04:34,080 --> 03:04:37,920
two so in reality the new we've been to

03:04:36,560 --> 03:04:38,960
installer that you guys that canonical

03:04:37,920 --> 03:04:40,080
are writing in flutter

03:04:38,960 --> 03:04:42,640
and that's going to be released in the

03:04:40,080 --> 03:04:46,880
future it's going to work on the baked

03:04:42,640 --> 03:04:48,640
raspberry pi have you considered that um

03:04:46,880 --> 03:04:50,000
we have we have and we are considering

03:04:48,640 --> 03:04:53,680
that still

03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:54,560
um like you say in reality the new ubu

03:04:53,680 --> 03:04:55,920
installer

03:04:54,560 --> 03:04:56,880
that those guys are writing and flooded

03:04:55,920 --> 03:04:57,600
that's going to be released in the

03:04:56,880 --> 03:04:59,600
future

03:04:57,600 --> 03:05:01,760
it's going to work gonna work we're

03:04:59,600 --> 03:05:03,200
going to make sure that it works

03:05:01,760 --> 03:05:05,279
i hope i haven't dropped the desktop

03:05:03,200 --> 03:05:08,640
team in it but that is i think

03:05:05,279 --> 03:05:10,319
fair to say three where can i find other

03:05:08,640 --> 03:05:12,560
people who are packaging snaps who could

03:05:10,319 --> 03:05:16,160
help me debug snaps that i'm packaging

03:05:12,560 --> 03:05:19,200
well let me let me tell you

03:05:16,160 --> 03:05:22,160
here let me paste this in this

03:05:19,200 --> 03:05:24,399
is the snapcraft oh dear that's not

03:05:22,160 --> 03:05:24,399
right

03:05:25,760 --> 03:05:30,960
dot snapcraft.io is the snapcraft forum

03:05:28,560 --> 03:05:32,800
where you can sign up and join in

03:05:30,960 --> 03:05:34,080
and have all the fun there are people

03:05:32,800 --> 03:05:35,840
from canonical

03:05:34,080 --> 03:05:37,279
uh who are very very regularly in there

03:05:35,840 --> 03:05:39,040
including myself but there are also a

03:05:37,279 --> 03:05:41,760
lot of community contributors and

03:05:39,040 --> 03:05:42,640
and snap people uh who are happy to help

03:05:41,760 --> 03:05:45,520
debug and

03:05:42,640 --> 03:05:47,040
talk about snap packaging and i'm

03:05:45,520 --> 03:05:47,680
frankly a lot of folks in there i've

03:05:47,040 --> 03:05:48,960
seen

03:05:47,680 --> 03:05:50,800
talk about snap packaging and then if

03:05:48,960 --> 03:05:52,800
you come with your application and they

03:05:50,800 --> 03:05:54,160
see that maybe snap isn't the best fit

03:05:52,800 --> 03:05:55,920
we can point you to in the right

03:05:54,160 --> 03:05:58,880
direction as well

03:05:55,920 --> 03:06:00,479
but um to address the first of my sort

03:05:58,880 --> 03:06:03,840
of calls to action here

03:06:00,479 --> 03:06:05,279
i would encourage you to to try and do

03:06:03,840 --> 03:06:05,600
the app talk about your experience try

03:06:05,279 --> 03:06:07,200
and

03:06:05,600 --> 03:06:09,680
look for packaging talk about your

03:06:07,200 --> 03:06:12,319
experience write about it blog about it

03:06:09,680 --> 03:06:15,200
and let us know because we'd uh we'd

03:06:12,319 --> 03:06:19,760
like to hear

03:06:15,200 --> 03:06:19,760
cool i think that's all of the questions

03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:23,760
is that the end of my uh closing keynote

03:06:22,640 --> 03:06:26,880
