right

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:30,880
no i'm misreading the schedule

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,160
uh thursday first time is adaptive apps

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,440
the future is now

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:39,279
ah to buy a spare that yeah

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,920
yes so

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,560
let's leave everyone with that first

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,440
talk and i hope everyone has a

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,440
great conference

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,959
fantastic and hopefully yep hopefully

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:59,839
everyone has a great time

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:59,839
see you all soon

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:47,680
uh so do i just start sharing between or

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,680
i don't know uh did you start

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,839
i think would be better if we'd be on

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,720
time so if you could wait for a few more

00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,399
minutes oh okay right

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,800
okay yeah because it wasn't really clear

00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,160
like interfere

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,320
okay people cannot hear me well that's

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,040
an issue

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,959
wait but so some people can hear me now

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,920
or

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:12,079
okay well then i guess because it's not

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,000
my problem

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:17,120
let me maybe readjust to the light it's

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,120
not on the camera

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,839
i can already start sharing the screen i

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,839
guess

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,679
so yeah

00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,679
[Music]

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,839
is this working yes

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,399
all right

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,279
uh well it would be better but the

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,600
problem is if i

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,720
do demos then i would have to turn off

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,880
the screen sharing like

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,160
17 different times which i heard is not

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,079
a great idea

00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,000
so yeah it would be cool if i could do

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,839
both but apparently that's not possible

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,480
if anyone has an idea for how to do that

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,480
um uh

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,839
i'd be open to it but like i was told

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,640
that the best way to do it was just like

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,520
do the slides

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,199
write a screenshot because otherwise yes

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,120
uh i mean also because like yeah

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,439
every time you turn on and off like the

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,120
screen sharing it's it's

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,360
just like three different dialogues in

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,720
the browser and uh

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,160
i guess that there's more string and

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,160
maybe it would be better but

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,679
well yeah i don't know like

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,559
what exactly are we waiting for like the

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,400
starting time is 10

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,720
or i don't know i guess someone will

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,720
tell me

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,840
okay cool

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:43,840
uh by the way uh what was

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:26,320
the bs can you hear me

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,320
or the others

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,640
okay awesome so

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,840
that's good i think that we're on time

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,840
for the bs to start

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,840
uh

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:08,880
um all right so it's time now or what

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,880
yeah okay cool um all right

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,240
then let me get this

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:21,120
okay um hello everybody

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,760
uh i'm tobias uh i'm on the design team

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,039
and

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,640
yeah uh this talk is not gonna be

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,559
totally new to those of you who have

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,640
seen my previous squad talks

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,760
um i used to always give these talks

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,520
about like sort of

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,440
state of mill mobile and like adaptive

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,320
apps and just generally the app

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,559
ecosystem

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,760
like developer tools and so on and this

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,720
is going to be like

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,400
basically another one in in that series

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,799
i didn't get one last year because

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,400
there were no real conferences and i

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,919
think at the time the thinking was very

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,200
optimistic that like oh next year

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,640
there's gonna be conferences again we

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,440
can you know

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,039
uh do things in the future but that

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,840
future is not here yet

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,880
so um here we are this is i guess like

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,720
the best

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,159
the best we can do at the moment it's a

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,360
little bit unfortunate because the stock

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,799
is going to have a lot of demos

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,720
and some of them are going to have like

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,840
animated things and

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,960
those are going to look very bad

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:16,880
probably because the frame rate is not

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,960
it's not great through this so um

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,320
maybe i can like where i'm gonna put the

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,600
slides maybe i can put links to all the

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,640
demos so you can build them yourself and

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,640
try them

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,039
um but yeah that that's kind of a

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,840
handicap here um

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,880
and i i i'll try to like do things a

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,320
whole bunch of times so that maybe you

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,280
can catch some of the frames in between

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,120
but

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,880
it's not gonna be a deal but yeah so

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,880
basically i'll i'll pick up from where i

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,240
left off in like 2019 when i last get

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,480
this talk

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,000
and kind of like uh bring you up to

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,159
speed on where we are now

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,919
and talk a little bit about the future

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,799
um but yeah since it's been a while

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,360
uh there's quite a few uh high level

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,840
things to

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,720
to catch you up on um here at the

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,240
beginning

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,080
uh the first of which is that there is

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,159
actual hardware now um there are like

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,000
real mainland linux phones

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,280
um you know not just like the lubricant

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,400
five but also the pine phone and there's

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,760
a whole bunch of them out there

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,840
and people are using them and developing

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,480
in them it's cool right

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,960
like this is something that we did not

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,520
have

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,559
at any point in the past and it's it's a

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,880
real step forward and

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,200
i think we can be really proud of that

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,400
um on the software side

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,679
one really interesting thing that

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,799
happened like basically since i last

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,320
gave this talk

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,559
is that live handy and kind of like

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,480
whole adaptive um

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,840
way of building apps went from this kind

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,960
of like cool thing that

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,799
that a few people were doing sort of

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,400
um and pointing parts of the ecosystem

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,600
to really like a core part of the gnome

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,679
ecosystem

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,840
uh world of handy is now kind of like

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,960
the de facto library where we put new

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,880
widgets um for gnome apps regardless of

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,520
like adaptiveness or whatever

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,039
um and along with that also i think like

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,679
the whole app ecosystem both

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,880
core and third party has really um

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,679
embraced the

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,039
this direction and yeah we're seeing a

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,320
lot of great progress in that in that

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,039
sense

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,919
um i think yeah over the last whatever

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:07,039
like

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,000
three years we've slowly been porting a

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,640
large portion of the core

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,159
apps and just like to talk about a few

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,120
that made like significant progress

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,159
recently

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,000
uh geary like there was a fairly

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,679
fairly long wide process but it's

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,720
finally at the point where

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,320
um most of the major things are adaptive

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,000
like there are still some

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,159
uh things to improve around the edges

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,679
but like so the base layout where like

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,720
you know it folds into various columns

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,320
and so on

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,240
um that is uh sort of upstream now and

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,840
yeah like all of the major pieces are

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,039
kind of in place um

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,520
there's there's gonna be more work

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,679
coming probably but uh

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,120
there always is right um another one for

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,600
example is calculator which

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,880
um just very recently adrian plaza's uh

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,080
did some really good work on and it's

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,400
now fully at that

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,559
upstream including all the crazy modes

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,760
um i can quickly show you that because

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,679
it's pretty cool

00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,360
so like if it's really large or like

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,480
this so the larger sizes there's this

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,000
max width

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,760
which is actually it's something that we

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,200
didn't really have before i think uh

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,880
before yeah

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,080
either it wasn't resizable or like it

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,880
just looked really bad i'm not really

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,320
sure but

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,000
anyway now it does something sensible

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,720
when you make it large then when it's

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,320
small like

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,640
so it does shrink to like fairly small

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,159
sizes uh even in like yeah the crazy

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,600
programming mode or whatever like this

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,200
this also works

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,960
and that's really nice thing where like

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,559
it's it's full width and the narrow

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,520
width and so like

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,240
it changes the column width there um and

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,000
yeah i mean

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,679
it's it's just like another example of

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,200
like if you do things properly in a

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,480
stream like you

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,279
just there's some real benefits for

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,039
everyone um from that kind of thing

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,440
and yes mother is an example like max

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,679
got some really nice uh updates at 40.

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,960
uh thanks i think mostly james westman

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,120
um bilal

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,640
and uh chris like did a bunch of work on

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,360
stuff like characters and a whole bunch

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,760
of other

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,120
so the smaller like utility apps and

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,679
they're all like slowly moving

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,400
towards um being adapted or are already

00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,400
there

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,000
um and yeah i think we've really made a

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,120
lot of good progress here over the last

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,320
few years and

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,880
i think we'll continue to do for the

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,799
next few cycles um

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,000
the third-party apps as usual are a

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,840
little bit ahead

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,919
where like i think yeah basically for

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,400
the last two years or so like

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,400
almost every third third-party app that

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,000
where it makes sense for it to run on on

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,600
like a mobile form factor

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,640
has been adaptive um yeah these are just

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,960
like a few of the

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,200
nicer examples uh one that i want to

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,880
show you is this translation app called

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,320
a dialog and the cool thing here is that

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,480
there's like you have these two

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,520
entries like next to each other on on a

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,880
wider screen

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,400
then when you make it narrow it just

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,840
puts them above one another it's just

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,400
like a really natural nice

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,360
way of doing that um so yeah kudos to

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,360
the developers this

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:50,159
is a really well known app um

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,880
so yeah um that that's kind of like the

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,279
the current

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,520
app ecosystem we have looking ahead a

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:58,080
little bit like gtk4 is finally out

00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,679
and that's sort of a big generational

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,279
shift like we're not really seeing a ton

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,279
of the benefits of that yet because most

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,559
of our apps are not actually for it yet

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,400
um but that's going to be ramping up

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,520
like the next few cycles and yeah i'm

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,480
going to talk a little bit more about

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,520
that later but

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,600
that's going to be really really cool um

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,039
zooming out a little bit from our like

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,919
specific

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,960
um context to like the wider industry

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,640
one of the things that's been really

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,520
interesting the last few years

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,279
is um how like the entire industry is

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,840
moving in a similar direction to

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,279
what what we have been trying to do

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,000
where like basically you have a single

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,760
app code based on ui um and you just

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,880
adapt it to various form factors

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,640
um in sort of like the ways that are

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,000
necessary but like without completely

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,440
redoing the app and i think

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,720
particularly interesting is that apple

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,520
is also doing it now where like in the

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,200
past they were

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,360
kind of like the odd one out for a day

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,240
when i was like no the iphone is like a

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,360
special flower and

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,039
mac is completely you know its own thing

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,640
and like you should make two completely

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:57,679
separate apps but like with

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,679
if you like look at last year's wwc

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,039
um developer talks like there's a lot of

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,240
talk about like

00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:05,760
um sort of these these various like

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,000
device form factors and then like with

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,400
mac

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,760
catalyst you can afford ipad apps to

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,400
through the mac like it's just sort of

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,240
like

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:16,080
an automatic part of your uh of your

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,440
development workflow and like even on

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,640
the design patterns they're talking

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,000
about like you have a tab bar at the

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,840
bottom like on the phone

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,200
he moves that same stuff to the sidebar

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,799
on the tablet and then the sidebar

00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,799
with some small changes stays exactly

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,880
the same on the mac and so it's it's

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,480
really cool to see that everyone is

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,000
sort of like going in the same direction

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,559
and you know

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,240
i guess it validates um it validates

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,600
what we're doing also from a conceptual

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,520
point of view

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,799
so yeah that's that's a little bit sort

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,720
of like the

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:48,640
the high level um high level updates

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,799
let's dive into widgets um so i think

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,399
when when i was last giving this talk we

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,080
were kind of at the point where

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,760
most of the important widgets that you

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,159
needed to like actually board apps like

00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,919
to

00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,200
sort of i don't know do navigation and

00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,520
things like that

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,520
we kind of had um but we were working on

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:07,279
a lot of like sort of

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,399
nice uh nice uh sort of improvements on

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,320
on top of that like for example the

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,960
backswipe gestures and so on

00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,360
and all that stuff is now merged and has

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,679
been

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,960
in actual use for like over a year so i

00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,320
think uh

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,919
yeah none of that is like particularly

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,880
new but i'm gonna go through them

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,399
quickly anyway just like to catch you up

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,480
yeah i think the first and most

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:29,360
important one of them those is like

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,559
uh the swipe gestures especially on back

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,240
end

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:36,720
so here's an example in contacts where

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,399
um at the smaller sizes basically like

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,640
you can click the back button

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,559
or you can like on a touchpad or a

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,640
touchscreen just like sort of swipe

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,240
just acceleration and sort of just you

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,640
know like all of these little details

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,840
like

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,200
it dims the background um and just like

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,679
behaves the way you would expect it to

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,840
which

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,039
as as always is always surprisingly hard

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,600
right um

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,559
but yeah that just works now and yeah

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,440
alexander mikhail

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,760
did a lot of really good work in this um

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,000
and

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,600
and yeah i think like probably all of

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,720
you are already using some apps to do

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,679
this that's not like particularly new

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,960
but

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,360
uh yeah uh sort of a

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,480
sister widget to this one is uh the flat

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,640
widget

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,559
which is basically the same thing except

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,880
like not covering the whole view

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,320
and this only landed fairly recently so

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,520
there's not like a lot of apps that

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,960
actually use it use it yet but um so

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,159
this is uh

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:32,480
kind of like uh initial uh step towards

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,679
supporting events like making an adapter

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,200
that comes with this widget and

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,080
basically it's like this transient

00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,840
sidebar

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,080
it's not like a completely separate view

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,919
it's basically like an additional

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,360
like space to show some information

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,440
related to the view so in this case like

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,200
the sidebar with with the pages

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,880
and you can like open it with a button

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,360
or swipe it like with the same kind of

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,640
like

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:56,320
gestures um as

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:58,080
as the lethal door or the deck um

00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,440
another one that i don't think i need to

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,039
show you a special demo for because all

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,799
the apps here basically do it

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,080
is around the bottom corners so that's

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,760
something that we wanted for a really

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,640
good time

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,080
and that for protective reasons that was

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,679
difficult because like

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,279
we could round things but we couldn't

00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,720
like really have that also clip

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:19,039
the the background or like clip the the

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,080
the children like inside a container and

00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,919
so essentially

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,120
uh you could end up with glitches where

00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,320
like in some cases it's wrong

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,240
in our case there's like stuff kind of

00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,640
sticking out so we couldn't really do

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,760
that

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,440
um thanks to alexander's work on hdmi

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,960
window that is finally possible

00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,640
along with a lot of really cool things

00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,480
but yeah it's just like one of those

00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,360
things where

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,960
you you you sort of like think about it

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,799
and plan for it for years and years and

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,200
then eventually it finally happens and

00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:47,200
it's it's just really cool to see that

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,279
um

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,279
yeah speaking of cool things alexander

00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:54,240
did the tabs widget is another

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,720
really um really really cool thing that

00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,440
we got

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,200
in recently where basically like

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,720
historically we had gtk notebook

00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,640
which you can kind of use to make tabs

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,080
widgets but like it only does a fairly

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,440
small amount of the stuff that you would

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,640
want by from a proper

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,880
like web browser tab system um

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,240
and so there was a lot of inconsistency

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,679
between different apps because like they

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,159
had to influence stuff like pinning or

00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,640
whatever

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,799
like by themselves and like the key

00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,399
bindings and like all sorts of stuff

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,320
but these new tabs it basically has

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:25,120
everything that you expect from some

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,519
proper browser level tabs or reality you

00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,440
can

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,120
sort of reorder them with animations and

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,360
you can scroll

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,519
like before there were like these these

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,840
it was pretty pretty lame

00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,320
um and yeah you can like move stuff

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,880
between windows and like it all works in

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,960
in the way

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,159
you would expect and it's just you know

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,760
there's like hundreds and hundreds of

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,320
little details and but if they're in

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,279
place like

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,080
it just like feels so so much better um

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,279
so yeah that's

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,399
that's currently in in web only as far

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,640
as i know

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,000
um but it's going like in the medium

00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,200
term it's coming to all the apps that we

00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,080
have the test tabs

00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,080
so like novels and so on so yeah that's

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,120
gonna be really cool i think

00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,880
um another one is avatars

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,480
um so historically we had a whole bunch

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,679
of widgets implementing

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,760
some kind of like standard avatar um

00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,200
or something like fallback default

00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,600
avatar um

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,960
thing where like if there's no avatar

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,320
picture like it will generate one from

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,320
the name and so on and there's like a

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,840
lot of edge cases with this because like

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,679
um sometimes you have the first name

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,799
sometimes you have the last uh

00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,799
last name sometimes you have a whole

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,480
bunch of names depending on the size of

00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,120
the characters like you need to scale it

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,720
differently

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,960
like there are different sizes of which

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,799
you want to use them

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,000
so um yeah we had a bunch of

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,120
implementations that all had kind of

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,720
like different issues

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,640
there was one fractal and one contact

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,120
the thing and one

00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,320
uh well there's the one that's still

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,679
used in the shell that we're hopefully

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,679
gonna get rid of soon

00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,279
um but yeah look so now there's like a

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,360
new one in the handy that actually

00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,960
covers all the edge cases and that looks

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,000
nice and like does all the things you

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,279
would want

00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,399
uh including like for example um if you

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,480
look at this one and this one

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,640
they're not actually the same exact

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,960
image like the letters here are smaller

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,240
than

00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,519
on here so it's like they're more

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,000
visible at the smaller sizes but they

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,440
don't get huge on the large sizes so

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,279
there's all these little details that

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,080
that you that you really want to get

00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,000
right

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,679
um and i think i think we're pretty

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,320
happy with what we have now

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,200
um so yeah thanks julian and everyone

00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,120
else who

00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,799
worked on making this happen and i guess

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,240
like over the next few cycles we're

00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,240
hopefully gonna get to the point where

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,600
we just use them everywhere um

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,360
i think like yeah right now they're in

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,679
contact uh

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,120
in geary in calls and very few other

00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,640
things but yeah i think we're getting

00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,559
there

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,320
um another one that's also not like

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,679
super new is the carousel

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,519
which yeah i think i already had a

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,960
working version of that like at my last

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,840
talk but not as an actual app to show

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,039
you so

00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,080
maybe that's a bit uh nicer so yeah it's

00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,600
basically just like a paginated

00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,519
scrolling widget it can be vertical or

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,880
horizontal but like yeah

00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,640
we usually use it for this kind of like

00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,159
slideshow um

00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,919
things and yeah you got all the same

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,440
like nice acceleration gestures

00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:06,240
as um as with

00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,200
stuff like back gestures uh yeah that's

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,040
just like sort of a

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,960
cool primitive to have for a whole bunch

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,240
of places

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,560
uh this is one that i personally really

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:18,399
love it's like a really small detail but

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:22,079
it's just really delightful um so

00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:23,760
if you sometimes you have lists where um

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,599
you you want sort of like various things

00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,399
to be grouped but then you also want

00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,599
them to expand

00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,800
but then when you expand them and

00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,399
they're still like grouped in the list

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,839
it looks a bit weird

00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,440
and so what we have here is the ability

00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:36,480
to basically like split out

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,000
things dynamically from the list um so

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,280
that

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,119
yeah essentially like they become their

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,960
own kind of like semantic unit

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,879
and yeah it's just like one of those

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,320
really nice details

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,159
uh that i personally really love and

00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,359
that's yeah i i wish we would

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,159
do more of this kind of stuff because

00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:53,919
it's just like it really elevates things

00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,280
uh when when you have these nice little

00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:59,040
touches

00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,480
um so yeah uh i don't want to talk too

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,000
much about all the stuff because i think

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,760
yeah you've all been using it for a

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,760
while so it's

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,880
it's nothing like too new a few more

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,520
things to shut up

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,119
um like generally the hdy window thing

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,560
makes header bars a lot more flexible so

00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,480
you can now do like stuff like header

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,240
bars above the content or like

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,760
um have them be transparent or like

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,119
slide out sometimes or whatever like the

00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,359
whole separation between header bar and

00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,880
content is now essentially gone

00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,800
uh so that allows for a whole bunch of

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,320
cool stuff uh

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,560
the column which is basically like to

00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,359
have a max width on things

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,720
uh can i also be used vertically um so

00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,839
just like also for max heights or

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,760
something

00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,359
um and so it was renamed to clamp

00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,440
because otherwise it wouldn't make sense

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,640
there's not a status page widget uh

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,160
which is sort of like for

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,440
if you want an icon and some text below

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,480
it or whatever for empty states and the

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,960
like

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,320
and there's also uh like apps can now in

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,880
their desktop file like

00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,520
sort of tell the operating system that

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,599
they're

00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,440
optimized for mobile so that's helpful

00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,160
for for example like filtering things

00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,000
out

00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:03,680
on on mobile distributions um so yeah

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,920
that's some of the uh the stuff that

00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,800
that i guess we got done over the last

00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,320
few years

00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,000
but now let's talk about future stuff

00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,440
because i think that's always where

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,359
the excitement uh really comes in

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,359
tonight um

00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:17,920
so one of the things that we've wanted

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,520
for a really long time

00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,280
and i think that was sort of like a

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,800
missing part of our developer story

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,560
for yeah since forever basically is

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,240
a proper widget library that actually

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,200
like aligns with our platform

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,400
um because i think historically the

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,800
strategy was always to like

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,480
move shared bridges into gdk but then

00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,760
there were always issues with like the

00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,800
release cycles kind of like being

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,720
misaligned and

00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,720
often we were like kind of frustrated

00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:46,960
that like our ux goals could not be

00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:49,760
met for like obscure gdk reasons um

00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,359
and so going forward we we really want

00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,040
to have a widget library that is

00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,200
actually like synchronized with our

00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,960
design um that is specific to our

00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,599
platform and that doesn't like need to

00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,520
have all these extra considerations um

00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:04,160
that are not really relevant for gnome

00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,280
um and yeah i mean basically like for

00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,960
the last few years i already

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,400
alluded to this uh handy has kind of

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,760
become this for gtk3

00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,680
but like initially it was just a bunch

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,200
of adaptive widgets but then like since

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,480
it was a place where where everything

00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,400
was going like people also started

00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,839
adding more generic widgets to it

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,680
uh if we have like the list rows and the

00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:22,160
avatars and stuff like that

00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,079
and so yeah i think it is the fact of

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,000
that now and we just made it official

00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,200
but for gdk4 we would like something

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,119
slightly sort of

00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,720
more like cleaner in terms of branding

00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,320
and messaging

00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,079
so we're introducing a new library

00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,760
called liquid wider

00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,119
which is named after like the rest of

00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,119
our visual language like

00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,640
the icons in the style sheet use that

00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,440
name so it kind of made sense to

00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,280
to use it here as well and basically

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,079
initially it's going to be a gtk

00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,119
or like it already is a gtk4 port of the

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,560
handy

00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,160
plus minus a few things that got

00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:55,440
upstream or whatever

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,880
um and yeah essentially

00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,640
like going forward this is going to be

00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,040
the new place where all

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,920
the like no specific widgets go and it's

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,800
going to be the place that app

00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,240
developers can

00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,240
can look at as like the canonical

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,520
implementation of all the

00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:12,000
uh like four patterns and in

00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,200
in addition to that um one thing that's

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,720
also currently in the works

00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,480
is a new version of the human interface

00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,119
guidelines um

00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,079
which of like it all ties in together in

00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,000
the sense that like

00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,839
historically one of the issues with the

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,359
hitting was that we were documenting

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,839
patterns that we didn't like have

00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,400
a single economical implementation for

00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,680
so

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,280
like we would describe the thing but

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,320
then you would have to build it yourself

00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,760
like based on

00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,960
basically that description and like

00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,560
there were all sorts of copy pasted

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,040
implementations in various apps or

00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,560
still are in some cases and so going

00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,000
forward what we want is like

00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,320
for the human interface guidance to

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,880
actually be synchronized with libido ida

00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,400
um so like you read about a design

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,760
pattern like in the higg

00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,880
and then you can just go use it uh like

00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,040
you know there's a link there to the

00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,560
widget for how to do it and i think

00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,920
that's going to be a major

00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,560
step forward for our developer story um

00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,839
as

00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,520
you know as always like that you can

00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:08,720
never have enough widgets

00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:11,599
um i think we are at the point now where

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,560
like yeah uh there's not that many

00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,320
things missing

00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:19,280
quote unquote um to to like

00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,560
build like really nice adaptive apps but

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,680
you know there's always additional

00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,000
things where you can make things easier

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,440
for

00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,200
developers and i don't really see that

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,000
changing anytime soon

00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,640
um one thing that we've talked about

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,560
recently

00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,920
was sort of like having a built-in

00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,920
version of like uh

00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,280
sort of the adaptive side of a tabs

00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,599
widget so like we have

00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,560
tabs but they are like basically desktop

00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:41,920
uh

00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,280
only and ideally we would like as part

00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,640
of that to have sort of like mobile

00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,200
components as well where like

00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,880
you have your text editor or whatever um

00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,720
that like has tabs on the desktop

00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,160
but then if you want it to run on a

00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,000
mobile form factor like

00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,200
it would be cool to if the tabs just

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,560
like work there as well and you don't

00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,240
have to do something custom

00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,680
like efficiently has a custom tabs

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,320
implementation that

00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,599
sort of does essentially this um but it

00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,960
would be cooler if

00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,599
app developers didn't have to do a whole

00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,640
bunch of work um to get that

00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:13,119
so i have a demo here let's see

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,319
i have a demo here that alexander made

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,000
um

00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:17,280
this is kind of like so on desktop you

00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,040
just like have basically these these

00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,400
regular tabs you can do all the regular

00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,680
tab things

00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,920
and then if you like reset it to a

00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,480
smaller size you get this panel here at

00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,000
the bottom

00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:30,720
where you can like add and remove tabs

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,839
switch between them and so on um like

00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,920
this design is

00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,359
like not 100 set in stone but i think

00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,760
something is direction is probably what

00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:39,599
we're

00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:41,359
going to go with for gtk3 uh for gtk4

00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,359
it's it's an open question like we might

00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:46,480
do something fancy or or not like

00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:47,680
uh depending on various other factors um

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,560
but yeah this is something that we would

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,839
really like to have um

00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,920
then there's a bunch of things that are

00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,760
more like on the wish list um

00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,280
but that that i want to talk about like

00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,560
just sort of to give you a

00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,800
more general idea of like the kinds of

00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:04,240
things that we're thinking about

00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:06,319
um so one

00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,079
problem with so in the last few years

00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:09,119
we've generally moved most layouts to

00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,400
list boxes

00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,000
because it's just like a cleaner more

00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,359
flexible pattern than the old kind like

00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,560
form layout

00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,960
um but one of the problems with that is

00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,640
that

00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,160
entries don't really work that well in

00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,599
that so they don't really mix that well

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,079
with list rows

00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,880
and so it would be cool to have list

00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,880
rows that are like

00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,960
optimized for that kind of work uh for

00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,240
that kind of um

00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,520
layout and so we have designed for a new

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,319
list row entry widget that would

00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,160
basically

00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:38,240
look a little bit like this in context

00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,680
where you have a list row that is

00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,960
actually the entry as opposed to like

00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,640
having sort of like a box and then

00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,640
another box inside the box and

00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,160
the the label kind of like taking up

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,599
half the width so you can only have

00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,960
really narrow ones and

00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,960
it will solve a whole bunch of issues

00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,000
with that it's not like a deal breaker

00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,880
for anything but it would be cool to

00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,400
have

00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,880
uh so yeah if anyone's interested in

00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,119
helping with that by the way uh

00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,160
contact us but yeah i mean it's one of

00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,000
the things that probably

00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,400
we're gonna look at medium term once all

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,839
the delivered weather stuff um

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:11,119
lands and so on um another

00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:13,040
one in a similar vein is the whole

00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,560
instax dialogue kind of situation where

00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,760
like on desktop

00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,160
you want dialogue to be a separate

00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,800
window that's just like overlaid right

00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,240
um but on mobile that doesn't always

00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,319
make sense because

00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,400
like you know if if your window sort of

00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:29,359
needs to take up the whole screen anyway

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,720
um you like structurally it would make

00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:31,839
more sense if it was just like a panel

00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,200
that you can swipe away

00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:35,200
but like so it's basically an in-stack

00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,200
view instead of a separate window

00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,640
um and technically that's kind of

00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,640
difficult because yeah you need to like

00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,240
sort of dynamically get rid of a window

00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:45,839
of a secondary window and merge it into

00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,839
the stack

00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:31,839
so here's the birthday

00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:41,200
all right can you see things

00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:48,079
all right yeah uh sorry about that isp

00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:51,440
issue i guess i don't know

00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:53,520
no internet anywhere in the house um

00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,280
uh yeah i'm not sure what that means for

00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,960
a schedule because i think already have

00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:01,040
like three minutes left

00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:01,040
but yeah i don't know

00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,480
well yeah telegram is the only thing

00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,480
that worked because like there was like

00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,119
i i tried to ping and like basically

00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,799
every

00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,160
15 seconds like three packages went

00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:11,520
through and

00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,240
the website was not loading at all i

00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:15,839
have no idea um

00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,119
but yeah i don't know like this do any

00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:18,000
of the organizers want to tell me what

00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:19,520
to do like

00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,359
should we just cancel it at this point

00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,200
because yeah i can't finish it in two

00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:25,920
minutes

00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:27,440
i can go until 53. uh all right yeah

00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,359
maybe we can make that work

00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,880
i'll try to be fast then uh so yeah

00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:32,720
there's there's some more stuff to be

00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,559
done on system dialogues there's ongoing

00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:37,760
work but yeah this this needs to be

00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:39,920
uh this needs some more work basically

00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,799
um but yeah let's get to the really cool

00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,760
part of the talk

00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:44,960
which is gtk4 stuff so um as you know

00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,200
gtk4 is out

00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,319
um there's not that many apps using it

00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,839
yet but like it

00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:51,680
we're like at the point where we can

00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:53,200
start porting to it very soon

00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:55,359
um and there's like a few things in

00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:58,160
particular that i'm very excited about

00:57:55,359 --> 00:58:01,040
um the first of those is animation and

00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:03,119
that's just like in general but like

00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,640
specifically a few a few things that

00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:05,760
that we can do now that we could never

00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,000
do before

00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,839
is things like this which is like proper

00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,720
physics based animation of like various

00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:12,400
different things

00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:14,400
uh this is a demo that alexander put

00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,799
together and i think with some help from

00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,559
manuel genovese also they really like

00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:20,720
that the amazing job like making

00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:22,160
the proper physics based spring

00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:25,839
animations work

00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:27,970
and this is like all gdk you know it

00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:29,040
feels weird you know to to

00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:30,319
[Music]

00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,400
to be saying that or you know what i

00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:34,480
mean like but uh

00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,760
yeah this is like a whole new world of

00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,880
animations that we could never really do

00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:40,160
before

00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:43,440
um and yeah the

00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:44,960
the next thing that's probably we're not

00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,280
going to be using a whole lot but

00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,799
it is something that's that's cool to

00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,319
have like for a lot of like sort of

00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:53,280
smaller details

00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:54,319
um similar to on the web i think is 3d

00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,359
transforms

00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:58,319
and here's a very interesting demo of

00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:59,119
something that we're definitely not

00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:01,359
going to do

00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,240
um but like so that shows off the power

00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:04,480
of this a little bit

00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:05,599
where it's like a full like 3d

00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:09,119
environment

00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:11,200
um and yeah this is all gtk4 so

00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:12,880
yeah a 3d transform is something that

00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:15,760
that we could never really

00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,480
never really do before um with gdk

00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,559
widgets

00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,640
and that we will be able to do with gtk4

00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:22,480
and yeah

00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,480
it's it's it's it's one of those things

00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,839
that that um

00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,520
that is great to have in your tool set

00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:28,799
even if you don't use it that time

00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,559
but really the thing that i think i'm

00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:32,400
most excited about is probably just the

00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:34,559
ability to scale things

00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,480
um because that was kind of like a huge

00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:38,960
bottleneck for a lot of like the nicer

00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,599
animation stuff in gtk3 because we could

00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,680
move things

00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:43,040
but like actually scaling them is is

00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,079
really important for a lot of

00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,079
the things that you actually want to do

00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:47,760
with animation um especially when it

00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:50,559
comes to like you know transitioning

00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,760
between states and so on um and yeah

00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:52,480
that is something that you can finally

00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,119
do

00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,599
and this this demo i think really shows

00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:57,760
off

00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:59,040
uh what you can do with that also huge

00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,119
kudos to alexander for

00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:02,319
for putting that together um so on

01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:04,480
desktop or like on

01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:06,000
a large size you like have sort of a

01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:09,119
regular tab bar

01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:12,079
um and like if you resize it use it like

01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:12,640
this mobile thing but also um there's

01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:14,559
this button

01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:16,400
that you can click and it like actually

01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:18,720
zooms out the tab

01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,720
and it gives you a grid with sort of

01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:22,240
like all the other tabs

01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:24,240
and this is the kind of ui that

01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:27,119
personally like i

01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:29,119
you know i'm not sure how familiar you

01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:29,599
are with like my history of giving talks

01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:31,200
but like

01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:32,400
this was my very first black talk was

01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,599
about basically this kind of stuff like

01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,000
semantic animation like

01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:36,799
these kind of like state transitions um

01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,559
between

01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:40,079
so like complete completely different

01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:41,119
states that are like totally especially

01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,280
clean

01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:44,400
um and yeah this i could not be more

01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,119
excited about the kind of stuff

01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,440
that that's that we're gonna be able to

01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:48,960
do

01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,799
this kind of stuff and also one

01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:54,640
interesting thing that this demo does is

01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:58,240
this very cool uh like uh sort of like

01:00:54,640 --> 01:01:00,880
clean the spatial

01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:02,000
color switcher um i think it's using

01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,640
shaders or something i don't really

01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,720
understand this

01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:06,400
you can ask alexander in the chat but

01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,520
yeah this is the kind of amazing shift

01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,960
that we're going to be able to do with

01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:11,119
gtk4

01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:12,000
one final demo uh that kind of puts it

01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:14,720
all together in

01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,680
into one really awesome uh package the

01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,119
first one

01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,839
uh which is basically like the ability

01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:21,119
to morph layouts and like keep elements

01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:22,799
around so like here we have these

01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:25,200
wallpapers and like a label and

01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:26,960
just this icon and i can click one and

01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:29,119
it not only scales up the welder but it

01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,200
keeps the text and the icon around

01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:32,240
where basically like they actually move

01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,400
to their new position

01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:35,599
i'm sure like you can see zero of these

01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,480
things

01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:39,839
in the actual stream but um yeah i'm

01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,280
gonna put links somewhere where you can

01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:43,040
actually build these yourself but

01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,480
if this is the kind of stuff that i've

01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:46,799
been personally waiting for for

01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,240
many years to be able to do this in gdk

01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:49,280
and it's amazing that this is finally on

01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,880
the horizon

01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,319
uh so yeah quick summary since we have

01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,960
probably like two more minutes

01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:55,760
um mainline phone linux phones are a

01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,319
real thing now

01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,960
um you know developers have them and and

01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:00,720
are making

01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,720
using them to make really awesome stuff

01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:04,319
um our app ecosystem is

01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:06,240
like going it up with left and right

01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:07,599
it's really cool um our developer

01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,079
experience with the widget library and

01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:10,240
the higgs

01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:11,520
is looking better than ever and yeah

01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,319
some really cool stuff there under

01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,480
horizon

01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:16,000
and gtk4 stuff i mean yeah do i need to

01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,799
say anything else like

01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,319
this looks so amazing like it's yeah

01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:22,559
it's really a whole world

01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:23,440
so yeah that's just to say the future

01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:26,559
looks really bright

01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:28,559
and i'm excited about uh where like

01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:30,799
gnome not only mobile but desktop and

01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:34,319
like everywhere else is going

01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:36,079
in the near future um some quick

01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:37,760
thanks because yeah i'm the designer

01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:39,200
here like most of the stuff that i'm

01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,319
showing you here is obviously made by

01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:43,200
other people

that i showed you today um but also

01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:51,680
like you know just helping with demos

01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:54,240
and like always being around

01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:55,200

uh for

01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:01,599
you know all the the work like porting

01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,880
all the apps uh

01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:06,480
like reviewing things like

01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:08,319
really everything that you're doing it's

01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,760
so amazing um

01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:11,039
and yeah there's a whole bunch of people

and yeah uh let's let's not forget about

01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,839
uh the design team or like the wider

01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,520
design team

01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:28,319
uh ellen and jacob who have been doing a

01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:30,960
lot of really good work on the higgs

01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:32,240
yeah as i said like most of the stuff

01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,319
that i'm showing you here it's not

01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:36,000
like my work but so like a summary of

01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:37,520
stuff that this whole community has done

01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,599
i'm really really proud of what we've

01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:41,280
achieved over the last few years

um yeah if you would like to be part of

01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,799
this amazing community here are some

01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:45,680
ways to get involved um it's all on gum

01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:47,039
gitlab or

01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,960
like you know there's matrix rooms that

01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:52,160
you can join and hang out

01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,960
um yeah join us let's build awesome

01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:55,920
things

01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:55,920
um thanks

01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:59,839
uh and yeah do we have time for

01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:03,440
questions or i guess not right

01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:05,359
now not really but if you want you can

01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:08,079
uh write down the answers to the

01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:09,680
questions of the shared notes

01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:13,119
okay yeah i can do that sort of just

01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:15,280
like asynchronously right yeah

01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:16,160
okay cool then yeah thanks so much

01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:19,200
everyone and

01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:21,599
sorry about the glitch i guess

01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:27,839
at least i got to finish it somehow

01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:27,839
thanks so much

01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:04,480
all right thank you for the talk

01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:06,720
so now while we wait for kimmy to

01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:08,079
upload his slides you should be now be

01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,520
able to

01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:11,760
let me know if you have any issue with

01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,760
that

01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:17,839
okay so you're using the pointer so i

01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:23,839
guess

01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:23,839
you can do it

01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:31,039
right can you try to unmute your

01:05:34,839 --> 01:05:37,839
microphone

01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:51,119
i think you have to rejoin and select

01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:53,200
join with microphone

01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:54,400
okay so while we wait for our speaker to

01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:56,400
rejoin the room

01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,440
uh let me introduce the next

01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,559
presentation so

01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:02,000
next on stage is clearing the hand and

01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:04,160
it will talk about application and

01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:07,280
popularization of windows programs on

01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:07,280
ubuntu kylian

01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:19,839
let's see

01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:41,200
okay while we wait for coding to to

01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:44,400
rejoin let us

01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:47,440
thank our sponsors again and if you

01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:48,799
haven't and you want to to chat

01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,960
with other members of the conference

01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:53,920
with the other participant you can

01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:55,599
find the link to the telegram channel

01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:58,160
and to the matrix channel

01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:59,119
in chat we also remind you that if you

01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:02,400
want to

ask questions to the speakers please use

01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,200
the

01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:06,720
shared notes that are on the left side

01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,079
of your screen above the participant

01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:10,079
list

01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:14,079
so let's wait a few more seconds and see

01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:25,839
if cooling managed to rejoin the

01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:25,839
chat and the presentations hopefully

01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,380
[Music]

01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:20,000
uh hello

01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:37,920
oh yeah okay okay

01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:49,839
uh ah sorry okay

01:09:56,239 --> 01:10:00,640
uh hello uh there are some more a little

01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:05,040
problem

01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:08,239
okay let's that uh hello everyone i'm

01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:11,360
uh coming out from killingsoft today

01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:13,440
uh my speech is the subject is the

01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:18,239
application and the populations

01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:22,000
of windows program

01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:25,840
ubuntu killing i will i will introduce

01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:30,560
the work we have done to promote windows

01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:33,920
application on linux

01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:37,120
okay uh

01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:39,440
let's pitch our this part one right

01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,440
okay

01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:45,840
um let's feature our this part one uh

01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:49,280
current saturation of

01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:52,480
linux application ecosystem

01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:56,560
two um schrodinger means

01:10:52,480 --> 01:11:00,159
one one at the current stages

01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:02,000
next the work of windows application

01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:05,280
adoption on

01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:08,360
linux by ubuntu killing the first

01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:09,520
part is our future research and

01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:12,719
development

01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:15,840
plan about how to run one

01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:15,840
arm architecture

01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:25,360
let's let's look at the current

01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:29,120
situation of linux application

01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:32,400
echo uh system uh look at

01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:34,239
this picture uh windows the windows

01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:37,760
system occupy most of

01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:41,199
the market place so for leaves there

01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:44,960
are chicken and add a problem

01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:48,400
until linux can provide equivalence

01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:53,520
for the windows application

01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:56,560
it's its market share on the desktop

01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:59,920
wells designated but until the

01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:02,159
market share or linux on that

01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,960
that's probably a reason no wonder we'll

01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:06,000
develop

01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:10,880
application for linux uh how should

01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,880
we break this vicious circle

01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:22,239
where is the one one is a good

01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:25,440
good answer we will use one in our

01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:28,400
operating system products

01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:30,159
to replacement the user requirement for

01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:33,360
windows application

01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:34,640
and some users have already paid a high

01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:38,239
cost for

01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:41,679
the price previous solution they used

01:12:38,239 --> 01:12:44,880
used on windows mainly in terms of

01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:47,679
labor costs leaning costs

01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:49,600
and the license fee by reducing the

01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:53,040
migration

01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:56,400
cost in this part more users can be

01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:57,440
attracted to map macris out of the

01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,880
windows

01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:03,840
platform we think that

01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:04,320
linux desktop is sufficient for daily

01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:08,719
use

01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:13,920
by normal user but the meaning

01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:17,280
the mean difficulty in domain-specific

01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:21,520
market with the zero-cost migration

01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:25,120
solutions describe about

01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:28,159
one it dramatically

01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:30,560
lowers the barriers that that print the

01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:30,560
user

01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:37,520
from switching to linux which increases

01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,520
its market share

01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:49,600
in that dummy

01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:52,800
okay let's look

01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:57,280
look at why when

01:13:52,800 --> 01:14:00,800
architecture the top the top is

01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:04,080
windows esc on the dot

01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:08,239
under the bottom move is linux kernel

01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:12,640
uh one is in the middle uh it is a com

01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:16,400
compatibility uh layer comparable around

01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:19,679
running windows application on several

01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:20,880
projects completing the operating system

01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:24,320
such as linux

01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:24,320
macos and bsd

01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:32,239
one can load p gram

01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:35,760
like a windows yes the dock

01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:38,960
underwrite it as an elf problem

01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:42,320
on linux that

01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:45,760
the one server can manage different

01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:48,960
uh with windows apps and windows

01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:53,520
different windows so back when

01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:53,520
windows apps can run on the

01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,840
linux

01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:05,600
uh let's look at that shortcomings

01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:11,840
one one at the one at

01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:11,840
the current stage

01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,960
uh let's look at the shortcomings one at

01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:22,239
the

01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:25,679
uh the kind of strategy which has uh

01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:29,520
undertaken the meeting

01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:32,880
are popular applications on windows

01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:34,159
desktop in china but this apps how many

01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:37,760
bugs will run

01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:38,640
them on linux with one and the last part

01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:42,000
of all

01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:45,760
this program in y is insufficient

01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:49,840
also the use of one is a little bit

01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:53,760
difficult for a normal user and

01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:56,880
a lot of tedious

01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:59,520
uh configure work configuration work is

01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:00,320
required which affects the promotional

01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:03,920
one

01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:07,440
one one windows application

01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:10,000
which other is as a telegram

01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:10,000
in china

01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:24,880
let's look at the work uh

01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:25,679
let's look at the work we have done in

01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:28,800
windows

01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:32,320
application adoption on linux

01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:36,320
first we take some files or when

01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:39,600
some bugs are critical secondly

01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:43,280
we developed a windows application

01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:45,840
packaging method based on one

01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:47,040
we packaged we pack the windows

01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:51,440
application

01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:55,199
in deep dabbing dabbing package

01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:59,440
aka aka dab

01:16:55,199 --> 01:17:03,280
which is user manager also

01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:06,719
i packed the wind to app apb

01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:10,000
image f image affairs

01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:14,719
which contain all 32-bit

01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:17,920
dependencies it can directly run between

01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:20,880
and between the different uh linear

01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:22,880
distributions and the phrasal sound from

01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:26,800
dependency troubles

01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:31,280
uh then we pass the one again from

01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:34,960
package f image to that performance

01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:38,400
to adapt to linux package

01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:41,679
management the last

01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:44,800
we also researched how to run one in arm

01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:49,520
architecture with cameo a current

01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:55,360
stage is so it shows

01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:55,360
slowly and essentially efficiency is a

01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:59,840
loop

01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:12,320
uh let's look at

01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:15,840
one fact

01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:20,400
okay fix some errors about attack

01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:23,920
which text editing uh add hacking and

01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:28,560
implement some missing features is

01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:30,320
it is used to resolve a display using

01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:33,840
about the text and the image

01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:37,199
is missing in which character test error

01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:40,239
and i also fix the videos

01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:41,520
stream or error when used which are the

01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:45,840
group for

01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:48,960
life so cloud

01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:52,000
that the picture is

01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:54,400
the picture is the which are

01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,080
allowed feature you can share your

01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:58,960
screen and the camera

01:18:56,080 --> 01:19:00,960
with the with your groove and number

01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:05,199
whichever is

01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:05,199
like a telegram in china

01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:13,760
uh oh i also

01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:18,159
analyzed that the eco which is

01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:23,590
which other kind of cap capture screen

01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:26,640
uh fix the battery to one

01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:26,640
[Music]

01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:33,040
error in qcad library and we

01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:37,840
wait for our two java it will call the

01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:37,840
video call field

01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:54,400
let's load the example uh apple

01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:57,920
image information app

01:19:54,400 --> 01:20:02,560
you may have image is a packaging method

01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:06,239
that kind of sells for content contain

01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:10,159
dependent library uh the finish

01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:13,440
the uh every major kind wrong are any

01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:16,480
base uh dis distribution

01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:19,840
such as ubuntu uh

01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:19,840
that team

01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:33,840
some information about the app image

01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:33,840
you can find more details

01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,840
uh

01:20:51,679 --> 01:21:00,880
package windows application

01:20:55,280 --> 01:21:04,320
uh step one package windows application

01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:07,360
by this this command

01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:11,040
one which has set up the esc and

01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:14,480
copy the red fonts to one container

01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:17,679
mod 3 modify

01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:22,000
some registry atom that the

01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:22,000
com application direct request

01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:28,480
for they reject the

01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:43,840
the

01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:51,120
which needs to be added as a y and

01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:54,159
reject

01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:54,159
while redux tree

01:21:55,360 --> 01:22:02,400
six uh file or copy further

01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:02,400
to

01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:11,840
to to the target package further and the

01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:15,040
dot dot one is the contender or

01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:15,040
uh recharger

01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:19,840
uh create uh six creator icons and the

01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:22,960
desktop

01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:27,040
entry files and rather shares

01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:27,040
script to run package

01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:37,040
uh round package windows application one

01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:41,760
one and add this pair to target target

01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:41,760
target further the last

01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:50,080
package in the windows application

01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:50,080
with this command tpk

01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:54,320
dktp okay

01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:08,239
[Applause]

01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:08,239
this sound works

01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:17,920
and uh we also researched how to run

01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:22,239
our arm architecture which is the

01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:25,760
cameo at the current stage

01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:29,760
our autists show it wrong

01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:33,520
slowly and the efficiency is

01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:36,800
low and the method

01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:39,840
uh under this the method how to

01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:42,960
how to round one with cameo in is

01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:46,320
user mode uh cameo

01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:50,800
i 386 and

01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:53,679
another one the following is

01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:53,679
windows apps

01:23:54,159 --> 01:24:03,280
this is the website is a

01:23:57,679 --> 01:24:06,400
manual or cameo

01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:10,239
we also test the box 86

01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:13,679
to run all of some tests

01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:17,840
show is efficient but

01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:17,840
how also many problems

01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:32,320
thus the blowing is some information of

01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:35,600
boxes 86 also it is which allow you

01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:38,719
run x86

01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:43,199
linux program online as it

01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:43,199
saves the architecture left left arm

01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:50,480
the the host system needs to be

01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:55,199
32-bit little ending

01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:58,320
the website is its main page

01:24:55,199 --> 01:25:02,080
uh if your interest

01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:05,679
interest is always you can

01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:10,719
visit this website

01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:10,719
now we found the emulator

01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:27,840
box data saves how good

01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:27,840
good performance but how many impacts

01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:35,920
okay this page is our future research

01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:39,440
and the

01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:42,000
developer land plan

01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:43,440
first we will resolve the one path

01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:46,239
report by

01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:46,239
our customer

01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:54,159
also we will research which edited

01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:57,760
at editing and direct show modding

01:25:54,159 --> 01:26:02,000
module and contribute back to one

01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:02,000
community of a community

01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:10,560
also we will we will research

01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:15,000
other similar simulate later

01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:18,639
technologies such as extra tier

01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:22,159
box86 we hope we hope we run windows

01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:25,679
application efficiently to linear

01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:30,000
ammo architecture

01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:33,040
by the way extra gear is a good

01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:37,360
simulator which our many windows

01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:41,360
applications are android system

01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:44,560
but it's not open source

01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:47,920
okay my speech

01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:51,840
is over my english is not

01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:51,840
as good

01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:54,239
okay

01:26:54,960 --> 01:27:00,159
and any questions thank you thank you

01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:00,159
for your listening

01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:08,080
okay last yeah

01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:08,800
there are some questions in the shared

01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:10,480
notes

01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:13,679
i'm not sure if you can see if you want

01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:13,679
me to read them aloud

01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:21,840
um

01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:25,679
i am look at him look at looking at

01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:29,360
the channels uh what what's the steps

01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:34,560
must one take to analyze a issue with

01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:34,560
one and try to troubleshoot it

01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:44,239
a reasonable result will one part is a

01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:48,480
difficult work i i think

01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:51,600
your your car faster your master open

01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:55,120
open your the log you need

01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:58,960
uh okay you'll also need a

01:27:55,120 --> 01:28:02,320
you also need a learn or no uh windows

01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:06,800
api uh how how windows api

01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:06,800
works how windows api

01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:16,000
api how how to use the windows api

01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:20,239
and you need to guess the logic

01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:23,280
of the function of the unica and how the

01:28:20,239 --> 01:28:26,400
how the api works

01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:30,560
uh how how it's run uh this is

01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:33,679
a little a little difficult

01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:38,239
also you must do many

01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:38,239
tastes and and

01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:45,920
and make sure what you what

01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:49,280
you you learn

01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:52,639
learn about about the windows api

01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:57,840
uh you you have must must be

01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:57,840
a patient and

01:28:58,159 --> 01:29:01,679
you you also learn about

01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:10,719
when code the code is

01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:14,000
large the code is very very large

01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:17,199
okay uh you must be patient

01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:20,800
uh log an analysis

01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:25,840
and then uh a repeater the

01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:25,840
circle i i think i think

01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:33,280
how does that learn from

01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:37,120
[Music]

01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:42,000
them and is worried about

01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:45,600
writing starter stream and editing

01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:48,080
the second the second

01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,080
question

01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:58,080
you need to learn how to edit the

01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:58,080
registry uh

01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:05,280
uh for one you might you you must

01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:05,280
firstly you must

01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:15,040
install or install the windows apps

01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:15,040
uh with one to our container

01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:21,840
let's look at let's look at

01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,800
the steps

01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:35,840
several several steps

01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:49,600
you need you need to know how one works

01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:54,880
and how how one when funded

01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:54,880
his container thought dot wind fell

01:30:55,520 --> 01:31:02,719
of course there are many many

01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:06,800
many works we have done two wrong

01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:11,280
wrong one wrong one

01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:14,560
this is my this uh this is my

01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:18,480
uh my method

01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:22,159
they really development one

01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:26,159
okay i i kind of

01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:26,159
i can't say also

01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:34,159
stop stop create

01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:34,159
our scripts

01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:40,260
if you if you have a used one

01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,600
before

01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:45,440
[Music]

01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:49,040
it's a little same you all the same

01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:52,400
you you need to know you need to learn

01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:57,199
learn more about our one how one works

01:31:52,400 --> 01:32:00,880
how our family one finds his container

01:31:57,199 --> 01:32:04,239
containers uh okay

01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:08,719
i cannot say more could you

01:32:04,239 --> 01:32:08,719
try to rather start further

01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:16,159
apparently that works the gtp

01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:16,159
and the qut is

01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:24,080
in their own

01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:26,320
with some wise after test

01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:26,320
uh

01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:46,800
another open source and it's the

01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:51,920
pennsylvania company is the product

01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:55,280
of tensioner company uh we we kinda

01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:58,639
we kinda know what what the water

01:32:55,280 --> 01:33:02,320
whether it works i i can

01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:05,600
uh linux apps first

01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:08,880
so so we we use one

01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:12,800
to adapt a one two

01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:16,960
run which has we can

01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:16,960
write this f

01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:26,560
if your package microsoft

01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:27,600
microsoft office like that and legality

01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:30,639
license

01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:33,760
will need to work

01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:37,040
okay the the license

01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:40,159
is a i think

01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:43,920
uh we need

01:33:40,159 --> 01:33:47,120
we need to take care to care

01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:51,360
this problem and and

01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:54,639
and communicated as a

01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:54,639
related company

01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:05,840
licensed before

01:34:14,420 --> 01:34:19,840
[Music]

01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:19,840
um

01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,400
yes

01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:31,600
maybe maybe it's a

01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,600
problem

01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:36,400
okay

01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:46,159
okay any question and this is

01:34:42,159 --> 01:34:49,360
my works to research

01:34:46,159 --> 01:34:52,800
one i'm glad to share this

01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:56,000
with with

01:34:52,800 --> 01:35:02,239
me with rs

01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:02,239
les thank you thank you

01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:10,239
all right thank you for your very

01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:12,560
interesting talk

01:35:10,239 --> 01:35:14,159
so there is one comment in the chat if

01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:16,159
you want to take a look at it is about

01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:18,239
why don't you instead of packing

01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:20,000
with check on your own why don't you ask

01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:23,040
tencent to do it

01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,080
um it's a tricky question i guess given

01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:26,480
that we have time

01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:29,840
maybe you want to try to to point or to

01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:29,840
address that one

01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:13,840
thank you

01:36:10,159 --> 01:36:18,560
okay my listening english listening

01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:18,560
skills is not as good

01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:25,840
that's my first time attending this

01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:25,840
meeting

01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:30,960
it's okay it was a very interesting talk

01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,119
so

01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:34,239
visual approach for you thank you again

01:36:33,119 --> 01:36:37,280
for

01:36:34,239 --> 01:36:39,840
for your presentation uh if

01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:41,679
no one answers any other question i

01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:43,360
think we can have a slightly longer

01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:46,480
break than expected

01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:48,560
so see you in about

01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:51,119
30 minutes if i'm not wrong if i'm wrong

01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:54,560
please someone stop me

01:36:51,119 --> 01:36:56,480
and thank you for our speaker so next we

01:36:54,560 --> 01:37:00,080
will have two more talks

vignoli who's going to share with us

02:09:53,520 --> 02:10:00,079
uh improving project sustainability

02:09:57,840 --> 02:10:01,760
italo i will have to ask you to click

02:10:00,079 --> 02:10:04,320

welcome thank you for being here okay

02:10:28,239 --> 02:10:35,920
um so i will uh

02:10:32,079 --> 02:10:40,639
i will talk today morning everyone

02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:40,639
i will talk today to about the

02:10:41,199 --> 02:10:47,239
project we started last year about

02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:50,239
improving the libreoffice project

02:10:47,239 --> 02:10:50,239
sustainability

02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:58,159
we estimate to have a user libreoffice

02:10:54,719 --> 02:11:00,719
as we estimate to have a user base of

02:10:58,159 --> 02:11:02,960
around 200 million people this is based

02:11:00,719 --> 02:11:06,320
on the number of downloads

02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:08,840
on the more or less on the share that

02:11:06,320 --> 02:11:10,320
we estimate to have on the different

02:11:08,840 --> 02:11:14,000
platforms

02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:16,960
we have 90 percent users on windows 80 8

02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:17,360
on mac os and 2 percent of linux linux

02:11:16,960 --> 02:11:21,280
is

02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:21,840
is is growing actually during last year

02:11:21,280 --> 02:11:24,639
it has

02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:26,960
almost doubled the number of of

02:11:24,639 --> 02:11:30,000
libreoffice users

02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:33,520
but before changing

02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:35,119
our numbers we want to have a stable

02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:37,280
situation so

02:11:35,119 --> 02:11:38,560
we estimate to have around 200 million

02:11:37,280 --> 02:11:41,440
users

02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:43,440
half of them are only using libreoffice

02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:46,320
half of them are using libreoffice and

02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:49,360
another office suite

02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:52,880
and when i mention office suite

02:11:49,360 --> 02:11:56,719
it is either desktop or cloud

02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:59,840
so libreoffice is a cloud version

02:11:56,719 --> 02:12:04,400
and it's exactly the same as the

02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:04,400
desktop version is extremely similar

02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:11,679
what how the market has evolved

02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:12,960
before 95 documents had to be printed to

02:12:11,679 --> 02:12:16,800
be shared

02:12:12,960 --> 02:12:20,960
then with internet we started to

02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:24,159
shed the digital documents

02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:28,000
and the concept

02:12:24,159 --> 02:12:28,000
of interoperability was born

02:12:28,719 --> 02:12:36,239
then in around 2005 we had the

02:12:33,280 --> 02:12:38,800
the standards and therefore uh

02:12:36,239 --> 02:12:42,320
interoperability was theoretically

02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:45,599
uh improved the problem is that we have

02:12:42,320 --> 02:12:48,960
one real standard which is odf and

02:12:45,599 --> 02:12:52,719
one non-standard which is open of

02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:55,760
office open xml so the microsoft office

02:12:52,719 --> 02:13:00,000
um proprietary

02:12:55,760 --> 02:13:02,239
format it is approved by iso

02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:04,400
but what has been approved that's never

02:13:02,239 --> 02:13:08,560
been implemented

02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:12,719
um although people

02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:16,079
talk about desktop productivity being

02:13:12,719 --> 02:13:19,280
dead the numbers say that this is

02:13:16,079 --> 02:13:20,079
not true and again when i mention

02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:22,159
desktop

02:13:20,079 --> 02:13:24,719
the product can the the software can be

02:13:22,159 --> 02:13:28,840
on the cloud but desktop means

02:13:24,719 --> 02:13:30,880
individual productivity in uh in 2018

02:13:28,840 --> 02:13:34,480
when ubuntu

02:13:30,880 --> 02:13:37,840
asked their users which

02:13:34,480 --> 02:13:40,719
desktop application should be there

02:13:37,840 --> 02:13:42,239
you see the the amount of people the

02:13:40,719 --> 02:13:44,000
number of people that wanted to have

02:13:42,239 --> 02:13:47,199
libreoffice was amazing

02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:50,880
we was even beyond our best

02:13:47,199 --> 02:13:54,320
guesses and uh

02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:55,760
google apps was there since almost

02:13:54,320 --> 02:13:57,840
forever now

02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:58,960
and although google apps was there

02:13:57,840 --> 02:14:03,360
libreoffice got

02:13:58,960 --> 02:14:06,560
around 80 percent of the choices um

02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:10,159
the the actually uh

02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:13,599
we are talking about a mature product

02:14:10,159 --> 02:14:16,960
but a product that is not declining uh

02:14:13,599 --> 02:14:20,239
and uh one thing that is uh probably

02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:22,800
uh adding interest is the

02:14:20,239 --> 02:14:24,079
attention for digital sovereignty it is

02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:28,000
now clear

02:14:24,079 --> 02:14:29,520
uh not only um because we talk about

02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:31,599
that but also

02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:32,880
because the authorities start to

02:14:31,599 --> 02:14:35,920
understand

02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:39,040
and to realize that to to

02:14:35,920 --> 02:14:40,560
to protect our digital sovereignty which

02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:44,560
basically means

02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:48,239
the ability of managing

02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:52,000
uh what we share with our computers and

02:14:48,239 --> 02:14:55,520
owning what we share with our computers

02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:59,199
the the format of files is uh uh

02:14:55,520 --> 02:15:02,960
is key uh and uh unfortunately they have

02:14:59,199 --> 02:15:03,520
not they didn't give it enough attention

02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:06,639
and this

02:15:03,520 --> 02:15:09,920
uh happens in more or less in

02:15:06,639 --> 02:15:10,800
everywhere in the world we have small

02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:15,360
exceptions

02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:19,199
the biggest one being the

02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:22,719
state of taiwan but

02:15:19,199 --> 02:15:25,760
in europe the situation is unfortunately

02:15:22,719 --> 02:15:29,119
very quite bad uh

02:15:25,760 --> 02:15:33,119
if we look at the uh the market

02:15:29,119 --> 02:15:36,480
and the revenues you see that in 2021

02:15:33,119 --> 02:15:40,400
they still have a solid 25 billion

02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:45,679
dollars and in 2025

02:15:40,400 --> 02:15:48,960
is expected to reach 31 billion dollars

02:15:45,679 --> 02:15:52,960
of course it is clear that

02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:56,079
when we speak about billions of dollars

02:15:52,960 --> 02:15:59,920
uh there is a lot of attention there

02:15:56,079 --> 02:16:02,400
and the people the companies that own

02:15:59,920 --> 02:16:04,000
a fair share of that market do whatever

02:16:02,400 --> 02:16:07,280
they can to protect it and

02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:11,840
when i say whatever they can

02:16:07,280 --> 02:16:15,280
i mean they lobby with authorities to

02:16:11,840 --> 02:16:18,000
protect their market share and they do

02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:19,719
whatever tricks they can with a format

02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:21,920
to avoid interoperability

02:16:19,719 --> 02:16:25,119
interoperability basically

02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:27,520
doesn't kill the market kills the market

02:16:25,119 --> 02:16:27,520
shares

02:16:27,679 --> 02:16:34,240
and this is

02:16:31,440 --> 02:16:36,000
the projected growth you see is around

02:16:34,240 --> 02:16:39,280
rather stable around

02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:43,439
five percent increase uh year over year

02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:43,439
uh until 2025.

02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:48,160
when we launch libreoffice our model was

02:16:46,880 --> 02:16:52,240
to

02:16:48,160 --> 02:16:55,040
have a foundation uh and

02:16:52,240 --> 02:16:57,200
an ecosystem around the foundation so

02:16:55,040 --> 02:17:00,000
the foundation would provide

02:16:57,200 --> 02:17:02,559
the represent the community and provides

02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:06,559
the governments on the trademarks

02:17:02,559 --> 02:17:06,559
but it's not releasing uh

02:17:06,639 --> 02:17:14,000
a commercial product so we

02:17:10,960 --> 02:17:18,399
release only the what we call

02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:21,280
the vanilla version of libreoffice

02:17:18,399 --> 02:17:22,000
which is the reference version and

02:17:21,280 --> 02:17:24,399
around that

02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:25,599
there are companies in the ecosystem

02:17:24,399 --> 02:17:29,359
that

02:17:25,599 --> 02:17:30,399
produce release software which is

02:17:29,359 --> 02:17:33,359
optimized for

02:17:30,399 --> 02:17:33,359
enterprises

02:17:33,679 --> 02:17:38,000
our stakeholders are community members

02:17:36,319 --> 02:17:41,359
and

02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:42,880
the companies that add value to the

02:17:41,359 --> 02:17:45,679
project

02:17:42,880 --> 02:17:47,040
and we have a lot of users stakeholders

02:17:45,679 --> 02:17:49,679
and

02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:51,679
they uh either they don't have any

02:17:49,679 --> 02:17:54,080
involvement because they use a free

02:17:51,679 --> 02:17:56,719
product which is absolutely fair

02:17:54,080 --> 02:17:58,399
or they have a very low uh they give the

02:17:56,719 --> 02:18:01,760
product a very low value

02:17:58,399 --> 02:18:05,040
because uh officers are a commodity

02:18:01,760 --> 02:18:09,200
and these as over the last 10 years

02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:11,519
this trend to reduce the value

02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:14,160
the perceived value of office readers

02:18:11,519 --> 02:18:14,160
increased

02:18:14,319 --> 02:18:23,519
so today based on the data that we can

02:18:18,639 --> 02:18:26,960
extract from our sources so from git

02:18:23,519 --> 02:18:28,160
we see that 68 percent of all the code

02:18:26,960 --> 02:18:31,200
is developed by com

02:18:28,160 --> 02:18:35,040
by developers that are paid by

02:18:31,200 --> 02:18:38,960
a company active in the ecosystem

02:18:35,040 --> 02:18:40,639
and volunteers are releasing 28 percent

02:18:38,960 --> 02:18:44,479
of code

02:18:40,639 --> 02:18:44,800
on the contrary uh 90 of donations are

02:18:44,479 --> 02:18:48,319
from

02:18:44,800 --> 02:18:51,359
individuals and around 10 percent from

02:18:48,319 --> 02:18:54,399
small and medium businesses but only

02:18:51,359 --> 02:18:55,040
less than five percent of enterprise

02:18:54,399 --> 02:18:58,160
users

02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:59,599
contribute in any way to the project and

02:18:58,160 --> 02:19:02,319
uh

02:18:59,599 --> 02:19:04,240
they can contribute by sponsoring that

02:19:02,319 --> 02:19:05,599
they could contribute by sponsoring

02:19:04,240 --> 02:19:08,319
developers by

02:19:05,599 --> 02:19:11,120
of course buying a long-term supported

02:19:08,319 --> 02:19:15,439
version from an ecosystem company

02:19:11,120 --> 02:19:17,679
they can sponsor the solution of bugs or

02:19:15,439 --> 02:19:19,439
the development of new features this is

02:19:17,679 --> 02:19:24,000
actually what happens

02:19:19,439 --> 02:19:24,000
most of the the companies that are

02:19:24,240 --> 02:19:28,240
the enterprises that are supporting the

02:19:27,280 --> 02:19:31,120
project

02:19:28,240 --> 02:19:33,519
at the moment are either paying

02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:36,719
developers also paying companies

02:19:33,519 --> 02:19:40,240
to have a bug sold or

02:19:36,719 --> 02:19:42,319
feature developed no one or very a tiny

02:19:40,240 --> 02:19:45,439
tiny tiny fraction

02:19:42,319 --> 02:19:50,800
is buying an lts version

02:19:45,439 --> 02:19:54,080
and this over the the the long term

02:19:50,800 --> 02:19:57,520
uh would create a problem

02:19:54,080 --> 02:20:01,520
for the sustainability of libreoffice

02:19:57,520 --> 02:20:02,080
um of course the the sustainability

02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:05,520
issue is

02:20:02,080 --> 02:20:08,960
not just a libreoffice issue

02:20:05,520 --> 02:20:12,000
uh we basically discovered uh

02:20:08,960 --> 02:20:15,920
the how bad the the issue could be

02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:17,359
in 2014 when the art bleed bug was

02:20:15,920 --> 02:20:20,399
discovered

02:20:17,359 --> 02:20:23,680
and after that there were some research

02:20:20,399 --> 02:20:26,560
uh the most interesting uh uh

02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:27,439
and the most uh accurate about that was

02:20:26,560 --> 02:20:30,479
uh

02:20:27,439 --> 02:20:32,319
nadiak bald research sponsored by the

02:20:30,479 --> 02:20:35,680
ford foundation

02:20:32,319 --> 02:20:37,600
and the paper is uh the title of the

02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:40,000
paper is roads and bridges

02:20:37,600 --> 02:20:41,439
the unseen labor behind our digital

02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:45,040
infrastructure

02:20:41,439 --> 02:20:48,160
in 2019 dries bouitard

02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:51,600
the the leader of the

02:20:48,160 --> 02:20:55,520
uh ah sorry

02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:58,800
diddy akuya and

02:20:55,520 --> 02:21:01,040
owner and i don't remember the name of

02:20:58,800 --> 02:21:04,000
the cms at the moment sorry

02:21:01,040 --> 02:21:06,080
uh publish a blog post balancing makers

02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:07,280
and takers to scale and sustain open

02:21:06,080 --> 02:21:10,319
source

02:21:07,280 --> 02:21:14,000
uh drupal uh

02:21:10,319 --> 02:21:18,080
is the drupal leader and uh

02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:21,200
these are a few excerpts from his blog

02:21:18,080 --> 02:21:24,960
and i think that rhys

02:21:21,200 --> 02:21:27,680
summarizes very well the the concept

02:21:24,960 --> 02:21:29,040
there are makers and there are takers

02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:32,399
and if the takers

02:21:29,040 --> 02:21:36,319
are too many or

02:21:32,399 --> 02:21:36,319
become two

02:21:36,479 --> 02:21:42,319
unbalanced with takers

02:21:39,520 --> 02:21:42,880
they can arm open source project and

02:21:42,319 --> 02:21:46,160
they

02:21:42,880 --> 02:21:49,600
uh can induce the

02:21:46,160 --> 02:21:53,359
makers to behave in a more selfish

02:21:49,600 --> 02:21:56,720
manner what is happening in fact

02:21:53,359 --> 02:22:01,840
is that after this problem uh

02:21:56,720 --> 02:22:01,840
we have seen a number of um

02:22:01,920 --> 02:22:09,760
the re-licensing of open source project

02:22:06,160 --> 02:22:11,680
uh to avoid the use of these open source

02:22:09,760 --> 02:22:14,800
project by

02:22:11,680 --> 02:22:17,200
large corporation we at libreoffice we

02:22:14,800 --> 02:22:20,240
don't think that this is

02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:23,920
a good solution

02:22:20,240 --> 02:22:27,600
we want to stay loyal to our copyleft

02:22:23,920 --> 02:22:30,160
license we do not want to go open core

02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:31,520
uh which is another solution which would

02:22:30,160 --> 02:22:34,399
be to have a

02:22:31,520 --> 02:22:36,800
uh aversion a stripped-down version for

02:22:34,399 --> 02:22:38,720
the community and a full

02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:39,840
featured version for the for the

02:22:38,720 --> 02:22:42,560
companies

02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:44,240
we want to have a single version and we

02:22:42,560 --> 02:22:46,960
would like to have the companies the

02:22:44,240 --> 02:22:50,240
enterprises behave in a

02:22:46,960 --> 02:22:53,359
correct way with us so

02:22:50,240 --> 02:22:56,960
uh going back uh

02:22:53,359 --> 02:23:01,280
when we launched this was uh

02:22:56,960 --> 02:23:04,080
what the summary of our announcement

02:23:01,280 --> 02:23:06,080
and uh the the objective was to relaunch

02:23:04,080 --> 02:23:09,439
the innovation at the time libra

02:23:06,080 --> 02:23:12,640
open office was close to that

02:23:09,439 --> 02:23:14,880
it is close to that that today

02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:16,960
but apache software foundation doesn't

02:23:14,880 --> 02:23:19,120
seem to realize this

02:23:16,960 --> 02:23:20,560
but the problem is that at that time the

02:23:19,120 --> 02:23:24,560
risk of

02:23:20,560 --> 02:23:27,760
the project being abandoned was very

02:23:24,560 --> 02:23:31,120
big so the community

02:23:27,760 --> 02:23:32,640
backed by several companies took control

02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:35,600
of the product

02:23:32,640 --> 02:23:35,600
and we

02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:40,560
wanted to relaunch the innovation and

02:23:38,479 --> 02:23:41,120
develop a self-sustaining project

02:23:40,560 --> 02:23:44,080
basically

02:23:41,120 --> 02:23:46,160
openoffice was not completely

02:23:44,080 --> 02:23:49,600
self-sustaining because there was a

02:23:46,160 --> 02:23:52,880
large sun investment behind

02:23:49,600 --> 02:23:56,720
it we wanted to change

02:23:52,880 --> 02:23:56,720
the structure of the project and

02:23:56,960 --> 02:24:03,120
basically we decided to have a

02:24:00,960 --> 02:24:04,640
the balance between community and

02:24:03,120 --> 02:24:07,920
ecosystem that there was

02:24:04,640 --> 02:24:09,920
men's mentioning before without we we

02:24:07,920 --> 02:24:10,640
didn't want to have a single corporate

02:24:09,920 --> 02:24:14,000
sponsor

02:24:10,640 --> 02:24:17,040
or to tweak the license to make

02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:20,319
the project sustainable

02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:22,960
so this is what the document foundation

02:24:20,319 --> 02:24:23,760
is doing the document foundation is the

02:24:22,960 --> 02:24:27,200
foundation

02:24:23,760 --> 02:24:30,000
behind libreoffice

02:24:27,200 --> 02:24:32,800
and after 10 years we can say that the

02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:35,600
document foundation has

02:24:32,800 --> 02:24:38,240
reached the objective is recognized as a

02:24:35,600 --> 02:24:41,280
leading force foundation

02:24:38,240 --> 02:24:42,000
we have established the libreoffice

02:24:41,280 --> 02:24:44,560
brand name

02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:45,520
although we still have the open office

02:24:44,560 --> 02:24:48,720
issue

02:24:45,520 --> 02:24:50,960
around uh because many people are using

02:24:48,720 --> 02:24:52,240
libreoffice and calling it open office

02:24:50,960 --> 02:24:55,680
just because

02:24:52,240 --> 02:24:58,479
the the the

02:24:55,680 --> 02:24:59,359
change resistance to change even in the

02:24:58,479 --> 02:25:03,359
name is

02:24:59,359 --> 02:25:07,280
is incredibly high but the problem is

02:25:03,359 --> 02:25:10,000
that uh looking at these figures so

02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:12,800
development the last two years as i said

02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:16,000
enterprise uh develop enterprise

02:25:12,800 --> 02:25:19,680
sponsored development was 68 percent

02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:23,840
uh volunteer is 28

02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:27,040
and of course volunteers are fundamental

02:25:23,840 --> 02:25:27,520
but they are not alone they are not

02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:31,680
enough

02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:34,720
to sustain the project at the pace

02:25:31,680 --> 02:25:38,319
that the users expect the project to

02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:41,680
to go forward to progre to make progress

02:25:38,319 --> 02:25:45,280
and if we look at contribution

02:25:41,680 --> 02:25:48,319
these of course are raw numbers uh

02:25:45,280 --> 02:25:50,560
they should be explained in in in

02:25:48,319 --> 02:25:51,760
in a larger amount of time but let's say

02:25:50,560 --> 02:25:54,640
that

02:25:51,760 --> 02:25:56,920
in terms of people there are around 50

02:25:54,640 --> 02:26:00,399
core contributors

02:25:56,920 --> 02:26:04,840
110 regular contributors

02:26:00,399 --> 02:26:07,920
and a larger number

02:26:04,840 --> 02:26:10,640
of uh casual contributors

02:26:07,920 --> 02:26:12,560
uh of course if you look at the casual

02:26:10,640 --> 02:26:14,800
contributors the community

02:26:12,560 --> 02:26:16,399
is a lot bigger for instance we have

02:26:14,800 --> 02:26:17,840
four thousand people active in

02:26:16,399 --> 02:26:22,080
localization

02:26:17,840 --> 02:26:22,720
but you know keeping track of everything

02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:25,840
would be

02:26:22,720 --> 02:26:28,960
really uh uh uh

02:26:25,840 --> 02:26:32,080
difficult we are trying to improve uh

02:26:28,960 --> 02:26:34,880
in localization at the time is not fully

02:26:32,080 --> 02:26:37,120
represented in this chart but

02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:38,399
this gives an idea more or less of the

02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:42,560
numbers

02:26:38,399 --> 02:26:45,760
and you see the in term of commits

02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:49,040
which is the difference of course

02:26:45,760 --> 02:26:52,560
this is not to say that

02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:56,560
uh core is better than uh

02:26:52,560 --> 02:26:59,680
casual uh contributors but tells you

02:26:56,560 --> 02:27:02,560
that uh we need to have a

02:26:59,680 --> 02:27:03,439
a a number of core contributors that are

02:27:02,560 --> 02:27:06,479
paid

02:27:03,439 --> 02:27:11,040
to make it absolutely uh

02:27:06,479 --> 02:27:15,200
sustainable so at the moment

02:27:11,040 --> 02:27:17,680
uh the

02:27:15,200 --> 02:27:19,040
basically developed pay-by-consistent

02:27:17,680 --> 02:27:21,920
companies

02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:22,960
uh is are a very large portion of that

02:27:21,920 --> 02:27:26,560
02:27:22,960 --> 02:27:29,600
of core contributions and without

02:27:26,560 --> 02:27:32,240
the contribution from the ecosystem uh

02:27:29,600 --> 02:27:34,720
we libreoffice would have issues in

02:27:32,240 --> 02:27:35,760
keeping up with user expectations so

02:27:34,720 --> 02:27:40,800
what

02:27:35,760 --> 02:27:40,800
we we say we want we

02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:48,000
we looked at at the background

02:27:46,479 --> 02:27:50,640
in the first four years there was a

02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:54,240
growth of the ecosystem companies

02:27:50,640 --> 02:27:55,600
uh we went from 20 to 60 full-time paid

02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:58,399
developers

02:27:55,600 --> 02:28:00,640
then we started to lose some ecosystem

02:27:58,399 --> 02:28:01,840
companies the number of paid developers

02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:05,120
shrinked

02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:08,399
now is stable but it should grow

02:28:05,120 --> 02:28:11,600
back again uh

02:28:08,399 --> 02:28:14,240
we we had several development cycles

02:28:11,600 --> 02:28:16,240
now we are at seven basically we think

02:28:14,240 --> 02:28:18,240
that the product is mature

02:28:16,240 --> 02:28:20,800
we don't need to focus the development

02:28:18,240 --> 02:28:24,399
cycle on a specific

02:28:20,800 --> 02:28:27,520
uh area like it was for the first four

02:28:24,399 --> 02:28:28,600
development cycles we are working at

02:28:27,520 --> 02:28:31,840
improving

02:28:28,600 --> 02:28:32,399
interoperability user interface solving

02:28:31,840 --> 02:28:34,880
bugs

02:28:32,399 --> 02:28:37,680
developing features but there is not a

02:28:34,880 --> 02:28:43,280
single area where we are

02:28:37,680 --> 02:28:43,280
taking care uh the problem is that

02:28:43,439 --> 02:28:48,479
the ecosystem is not growing as much as

02:28:46,080 --> 02:28:51,680
the community

02:28:48,479 --> 02:28:53,760
we the the

02:28:51,680 --> 02:28:55,600
relationship between the ecosystem and

02:28:53,760 --> 02:28:59,200
community are not ideal

02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:59,920
because there are some community members

02:28:59,200 --> 02:29:02,560
that

02:28:59,920 --> 02:29:04,399
look at ecosystem company in a negative

02:29:02,560 --> 02:29:08,800
way and this is not

02:29:04,399 --> 02:29:12,240
good and

02:29:08,800 --> 02:29:14,399
with the young contributors coming in

02:29:12,240 --> 02:29:16,640
and a large number of community members

02:29:14,399 --> 02:29:19,200
is not aware of the root of the

02:29:16,640 --> 02:29:21,280
background of the project

02:29:19,200 --> 02:29:23,200
and they provide enthusiastic

02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:24,880
contribution but in some cases they

02:29:23,200 --> 02:29:27,760
create frictions as well

02:29:24,880 --> 02:29:29,120
so the the issue is that we we have to

02:29:27,760 --> 02:29:32,160
work together

02:29:29,120 --> 02:29:33,280
to develop the strategy for a next

02:29:32,160 --> 02:29:36,399
decade

02:29:33,280 --> 02:29:39,840
that guarantees and bring libreoffice to

02:29:36,399 --> 02:29:42,240
to everyone uh

02:29:39,840 --> 02:29:43,439
at the moment libreoffice is the only

02:29:42,240 --> 02:29:46,080
viable

02:29:43,439 --> 02:29:48,319
free open source software alternative to

02:29:46,080 --> 02:29:51,760
microsoft office

02:29:48,319 --> 02:29:54,479
we are at the crossroad of the

02:29:51,760 --> 02:29:55,280
uh force ecosystem if you look at this

02:29:54,479 --> 02:29:57,680
uh

02:29:55,280 --> 02:29:59,680
the project at the mo at the time as a

02:29:57,680 --> 02:30:00,319
large community there are volunteers

02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:03,280
there is a

02:30:00,319 --> 02:30:05,600
ecosystem there is a large overlap

02:30:03,280 --> 02:30:09,200
between volunteers and ecosystem

02:30:05,600 --> 02:30:10,080
many people employed by ecosystem

02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:12,560
companies are

02:30:10,080 --> 02:30:13,439
also contributing as volunteers in other

02:30:12,560 --> 02:30:15,760
areas

02:30:13,439 --> 02:30:17,760
for instance they may be translating the

02:30:15,760 --> 02:30:21,120
interface in their

02:30:17,760 --> 02:30:25,359
native language they can organize events

02:30:21,120 --> 02:30:28,880
uh there is quite a lot of overlapping

02:30:25,359 --> 02:30:29,520
and if you look at the at the different

02:30:28,880 --> 02:30:32,479
uh

02:30:29,520 --> 02:30:32,479
the the entire

02:30:33,040 --> 02:30:40,720
fourth world we we are basically

02:30:37,120 --> 02:30:44,160
more or less in the center because we

02:30:40,720 --> 02:30:45,520
we get we have a little bit of a

02:30:44,160 --> 02:30:48,319
foundation

02:30:45,520 --> 02:30:50,080
we have a little bit of a traditional

02:30:48,319 --> 02:30:53,680
software companies and

02:30:50,080 --> 02:30:57,280
we have integration support and so on

02:30:53,680 --> 02:31:00,720
so libreoffice is uh

02:30:57,280 --> 02:31:02,800
we think is is is a key product for the

02:31:00,720 --> 02:31:04,880
open source ecosystem it is a key

02:31:02,800 --> 02:31:08,319
product for the linux ecosystem

02:31:04,880 --> 02:31:13,200
our objective is to provide

02:31:08,319 --> 02:31:17,680
the best free open source office suite

02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:19,680
we want to improve our marketing by

02:31:17,680 --> 02:31:20,960
underlying in the peculiarities of the

02:31:19,680 --> 02:31:24,800
libreoffice project

02:31:20,960 --> 02:31:28,000
we are there is a big effort in

02:31:24,800 --> 02:31:31,439
producing marketing materials i

02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:33,680
will cover that in after

02:31:31,439 --> 02:31:33,680
so

02:31:34,479 --> 02:31:38,560
the the unique selling proposition of

02:31:36,640 --> 02:31:40,319
libreoffice is the best open source

02:31:38,560 --> 02:31:43,280
office suite ever

02:31:40,319 --> 02:31:46,240
backed by a strong community is

02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:49,200
providing the standard document format

02:31:46,240 --> 02:31:51,439
for interoperability but as also

02:31:49,200 --> 02:31:53,840
providing a superior compatibility

02:31:51,439 --> 02:31:55,200
proprietary document format and believe

02:31:53,840 --> 02:31:59,280
me

02:31:55,200 --> 02:32:03,040
being compatible with office open xml

02:31:59,280 --> 02:32:06,160
is incredibly difficult because they

02:32:03,040 --> 02:32:08,840
are doing uh as much as they can to

02:32:06,160 --> 02:32:11,120
to make the mission this emission

02:32:08,840 --> 02:32:13,840
impossible

02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:15,359
we provide the best of open source with

02:32:13,840 --> 02:32:18,399
professional open source

02:32:15,359 --> 02:32:23,120
professional support for

02:32:18,399 --> 02:32:23,120
enterprises and also

02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:29,040
optimized uh activities to

02:32:26,800 --> 02:32:31,920
for uh managing strategic business

02:32:29,040 --> 02:32:34,080
content for the enterprises that want to

02:32:31,920 --> 02:32:35,040
uh use libreoffice for that and there

02:32:34,080 --> 02:32:38,479
are governments

02:32:35,040 --> 02:32:41,680
using uh libreoffice for uh uh

02:32:38,479 --> 02:32:43,680
their uh objectives so uh libreoffice

02:32:41,680 --> 02:32:47,680
can be a strategic tool

02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:47,680
and is a strategic tool for many

02:32:47,920 --> 02:32:52,960
the next any answer uh what are we doing

02:32:51,280 --> 02:32:55,920
so uh

02:32:52,960 --> 02:32:58,479
we have developed the concept of

02:32:55,920 --> 02:33:01,280
libreoffice technology basically

02:32:58,479 --> 02:33:03,840
libreoffice has evolved from a single

02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:06,000
product to a platform

02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:07,120
for the development of different

02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:10,160
solutions which

02:33:07,120 --> 02:33:14,160
are free open source solutions

02:33:10,160 --> 02:33:16,960
and are targeted to different public

02:33:14,160 --> 02:33:19,120
the fact that we have a single platform

02:33:16,960 --> 02:33:21,680
for all of this

02:33:19,120 --> 02:33:23,680
represents an advantage over other

02:33:21,680 --> 02:33:24,560
software because they have a different

02:33:23,680 --> 02:33:28,000
platform

02:33:24,560 --> 02:33:32,000
for every different uh public

02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:34,000
and even for every different application

02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:35,840
we have to reduce the perception that

02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,960
the document foundation is a software

02:33:35,840 --> 02:33:40,000
vendor

02:33:36,960 --> 02:33:43,600
because people think that we provide

02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:46,640
support and other services we do not

02:33:43,600 --> 02:33:49,200
we are not for profit so we

02:33:46,640 --> 02:33:50,240
cannot sell and basically we cannot sell

02:33:49,200 --> 02:33:53,680
anything

02:33:50,240 --> 02:33:57,359
apart from some swags or some

02:33:53,680 --> 02:33:57,359
uh marketing materials

02:33:57,439 --> 02:34:01,439
we have to communicate uh better and

02:34:00,720 --> 02:34:05,120
more in

02:34:01,439 --> 02:34:07,760
a more coordinated way to make it easier

02:34:05,120 --> 02:34:10,080
for users to understand which is the

02:34:07,760 --> 02:34:14,240
best libreoffice version for their needs

02:34:10,080 --> 02:34:17,840
so we have to make enterprises aware

02:34:14,240 --> 02:34:19,200
that the libreoffice version released by

02:34:17,840 --> 02:34:22,240
the document foundation

02:34:19,200 --> 02:34:23,760
might not might not be the best solution

02:34:22,240 --> 02:34:26,240
for them

02:34:23,760 --> 02:34:28,000
uh on one case yes they would have a

02:34:26,240 --> 02:34:30,720
free completely free product

02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:33,359
on the other end they would not have a

02:34:30,720 --> 02:34:36,960
professionally supported product

02:34:33,359 --> 02:34:40,000
professionally supported in term of

02:34:36,960 --> 02:34:40,880
support availability volunteers cannot

02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:44,399
be

02:34:40,880 --> 02:34:47,680
cannot provide support 24 hours by seven

02:34:44,399 --> 02:34:48,399
cannot provide support every day of the

02:34:47,680 --> 02:34:50,880
year

02:34:48,399 --> 02:34:51,840
uh they have their families they have

02:34:50,880 --> 02:34:54,880
they they

02:34:51,840 --> 02:34:58,319
basically work according to the schedule

02:34:54,880 --> 02:34:59,840
while enterprises want a service a full

02:34:58,319 --> 02:35:02,319
service

02:34:59,840 --> 02:35:02,319
support

02:35:04,479 --> 02:35:08,880
what about libreoffice technology same

02:35:07,760 --> 02:35:13,040
processing engine

02:35:08,880 --> 02:35:13,359
for all modules the source code has been

02:35:13,040 --> 02:35:16,399
re

02:35:13,359 --> 02:35:17,040
cleaned and refactored we have a very

02:35:16,399 --> 02:35:20,080
high

02:35:17,040 --> 02:35:23,680
code quality and consistency

02:35:20,080 --> 02:35:27,120
we have apis that make it easier

02:35:23,680 --> 02:35:30,479
than in the past of course to

02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:30,479
develop product

02:35:31,359 --> 02:35:37,520
we have uh we have a web page about

02:35:34,720 --> 02:35:40,960
libreoffice technology

02:35:37,520 --> 02:35:42,800
we have a white paper that explains what

02:35:40,960 --> 02:35:47,280
it is so basically

02:35:42,800 --> 02:35:48,240
this image summarize the advantage as

02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:50,000
you see

02:35:48,240 --> 02:35:51,840
in the case of libreoffice we have a

02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:55,439
common productivity engine

02:35:51,840 --> 02:35:55,840
we have the same open document format

02:35:55,439 --> 02:36:00,720
for

02:35:55,840 --> 02:36:00,720
every uh for every

02:36:00,800 --> 02:36:06,000
single application then we have desktop

02:36:03,600 --> 02:36:09,040
application each one with his own

02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:14,319
user interface we have mobile platforms

02:36:09,040 --> 02:36:17,439
we have tablets with smartphones

02:36:14,319 --> 02:36:19,520
and then we have cloud platforms and the

02:36:17,439 --> 02:36:22,000
user interface is different but it's

02:36:19,520 --> 02:36:24,479
only the user interface is different

02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:27,439
if you look at the other software both

02:36:24,479 --> 02:36:30,720
proprietary and open core

02:36:27,439 --> 02:36:33,280
they have up a different engine for

02:36:30,720 --> 02:36:35,680
each platform so they have a word

02:36:33,280 --> 02:36:36,399
processing engine for the desktop a word

02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:38,880
processing

02:36:36,399 --> 02:36:39,600
engine for mobile and a word processing

02:36:38,880 --> 02:36:41,680
engine

02:36:39,600 --> 02:36:43,680
for the cloud and then they have a

02:36:41,680 --> 02:36:47,520
different format

02:36:43,680 --> 02:36:50,560
for on on each platform yes

02:36:47,520 --> 02:36:53,680
the extension is the same but

02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:54,479
again yes the format is completely

02:36:53,680 --> 02:36:57,600
different and

02:36:54,479 --> 02:37:00,880
believe me it can be

02:36:57,600 --> 02:37:04,000
dramatically different in term of

02:37:00,880 --> 02:37:07,399
xml syntax

02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:12,280
behind it and this makes of course

02:37:07,399 --> 02:37:14,800
interoperability more challenging and uh

02:37:12,280 --> 02:37:16,080
interoperability for users more

02:37:14,800 --> 02:37:18,000
challenging

02:37:16,080 --> 02:37:19,439
and interoperability for software

02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:23,280
developers

02:37:19,439 --> 02:37:23,280
a really difficult mission

02:37:23,439 --> 02:37:30,560
um so we went from product to platform

02:37:28,399 --> 02:37:31,600
today we have a libreoffice for the

02:37:30,560 --> 02:37:34,240
desktop

02:37:31,600 --> 02:37:35,600
libreoffice long-term supported optimize

02:37:34,240 --> 02:37:38,479
for enterprises

02:37:35,600 --> 02:37:39,040
for the desktop libreoffice online for

02:37:38,479 --> 02:37:41,760
the cloud

02:37:39,040 --> 02:37:44,640
libreoffice mobile for android and ios

02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:47,840
and libreoffice for chrome os

02:37:44,640 --> 02:37:49,359
all these product are from different

02:37:47,840 --> 02:37:52,880
organization

02:37:49,359 --> 02:37:55,920
but share the same engine so they they

02:37:52,880 --> 02:37:55,920
can have

02:37:57,439 --> 02:38:01,120
a different name for instance on the

02:37:59,600 --> 02:38:05,200
cloud you have a

02:38:01,120 --> 02:38:07,840
collabora office online

02:38:05,200 --> 02:38:10,080
but the engine is the same so

02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:13,520
consistency of format

02:38:10,080 --> 02:38:16,560
is absolutely the same

02:38:13,520 --> 02:38:18,720
of course on linux phone i'm trying to

02:38:16,560 --> 02:38:20,319
look at questions on linux phone you can

02:38:18,720 --> 02:38:23,200
use

02:38:20,319 --> 02:38:25,760
libreoffice for the desktop it works we

02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:29,840
have seen

02:38:25,760 --> 02:38:29,840
on the

02:38:30,080 --> 02:38:35,040
linux phone that have been released

02:38:32,880 --> 02:38:38,479
libreoffice working of course the user

02:38:35,040 --> 02:38:41,600
interface is not optimized

02:38:38,479 --> 02:38:45,040
some some tweaks

02:38:41,600 --> 02:38:46,560
have to be applied and we expect in this

02:38:45,040 --> 02:38:48,880
case that the provider

02:38:46,560 --> 02:38:51,200
of the optimize the distribution for

02:38:48,880 --> 02:38:54,840
linux desktop is doing this

02:38:51,200 --> 02:38:58,880
anyway uh the source code is free

02:38:54,840 --> 02:39:02,080
so it's up to people also to

02:38:58,880 --> 02:39:02,080
provide these tweaks

02:39:03,280 --> 02:39:08,560
what we have done to go from product to

02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,560
platform

02:39:09,280 --> 02:39:11,840
we

02:39:12,319 --> 02:39:17,760
we work on document interoperability

02:39:14,880 --> 02:39:20,720
these are example visual example

02:39:17,760 --> 02:39:20,720
of challenging

02:39:21,439 --> 02:39:27,760
documents and one is the original uh

02:39:25,200 --> 02:39:30,000
uh document and the other one is

02:39:27,760 --> 02:39:33,120
exported by libreoffice

02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:34,800
uh of course uh there are still corner

02:39:33,120 --> 02:39:38,080
cases where the product

02:39:34,800 --> 02:39:40,720
the so the the document opens in a in a

02:39:38,080 --> 02:39:41,120
completely different way first thing to

02:39:40,720 --> 02:39:44,479
do

02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:47,600
is to look at the fonts fonts can

02:39:44,479 --> 02:39:49,760
be misleading you can have the the

02:39:47,600 --> 02:39:50,800
the visual appearance completely

02:39:49,760 --> 02:39:54,399
different

02:39:50,800 --> 02:39:58,080
but the contents are all there and uh

02:39:54,399 --> 02:40:00,560
of course funds are a locking

02:39:58,080 --> 02:40:02,880
component are a component of the locking

02:40:00,560 --> 02:40:05,520
of microsoft locking strategy

02:40:02,880 --> 02:40:06,080
is not by chance that today that we have

02:40:05,520 --> 02:40:09,680
that that

02:40:06,080 --> 02:40:11,040
the open source world provides a working

02:40:09,680 --> 02:40:14,160
solution

02:40:11,040 --> 02:40:14,880
for uh to replace calibri cambria in

02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:18,080
console

02:40:14,880 --> 02:40:21,279
consoles and so on microsoft

02:40:18,080 --> 02:40:22,880
has announced that they will deprecate

02:40:21,279 --> 02:40:26,240
those funds

02:40:22,880 --> 02:40:30,560
and they will create brand new funds uh

02:40:26,240 --> 02:40:33,680
for windows and for uh microsoft office

02:40:30,560 --> 02:40:35,680
uh so that we will have to create

02:40:33,680 --> 02:40:38,560
new open source funds that are

02:40:35,680 --> 02:40:40,800
metrically compatible with the new funds

02:40:38,560 --> 02:40:42,080
and i don't think that this is just by

02:40:40,800 --> 02:40:45,120
chance calibri

02:40:42,080 --> 02:40:46,319
in one sense was a very nice font we

02:40:45,120 --> 02:40:48,800
have carlito that

02:40:46,319 --> 02:40:50,319
reproduce calibri but now calibri will

02:40:48,800 --> 02:40:53,359
be deprecated

02:40:50,319 --> 02:40:55,520
and uh i don't think that

02:40:53,359 --> 02:40:57,279
this is a coincidence this is done on

02:40:55,520 --> 02:41:00,080
purpose because uh

02:40:57,279 --> 02:41:02,399
the the fact that funds were available

02:41:00,080 --> 02:41:03,840
for interoperability has reduced the

02:41:02,399 --> 02:41:07,279
number of issues

02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:10,800
that users were facing when

02:41:07,279 --> 02:41:11,760
opening a document created for instance

02:41:10,800 --> 02:41:16,000
with calibri

02:41:11,760 --> 02:41:19,120
on windows we do round-trip tests for

02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:23,040
uh all the all the documents

02:41:19,120 --> 02:41:24,080
there is uh um if you happen to open a

02:41:23,040 --> 02:41:26,640
document uh

02:41:24,080 --> 02:41:28,840
a microsoft office document that doesn't

02:41:26,640 --> 02:41:32,800
open perfectly

02:41:28,840 --> 02:41:35,359
um in most cases there is a workaround

02:41:32,800 --> 02:41:36,800
there is a solution first again look at

02:41:35,359 --> 02:41:40,080
the fonts

02:41:36,800 --> 02:41:44,399
but the interoperability should be

02:41:40,080 --> 02:41:45,359
there a little bit about open document

02:41:44,399 --> 02:41:47,840
format

02:41:45,359 --> 02:41:48,800
is independent interoperable neutral

02:41:47,840 --> 02:41:52,560
perennial

02:41:48,800 --> 02:41:54,319
many advantages um

02:41:52,560 --> 02:41:56,160
software based on libreoffice

02:41:54,319 --> 02:41:59,600
technologies available as a

02:41:56,160 --> 02:42:00,720
as i said from many different companies

02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:04,000
i have uh

02:42:00,720 --> 02:42:07,279
added some names here

02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:09,359
look if you want to get it from the

02:42:07,279 --> 02:42:11,040
windows store from the apple store look

02:42:09,359 --> 02:42:14,240
for the company name

02:42:11,040 --> 02:42:17,760
you will find a libreoffice based

02:42:14,240 --> 02:42:21,279
solution if it is

02:42:17,760 --> 02:42:24,319
sorry if you have to pay for it

02:42:21,279 --> 02:42:27,680
on the windows store on on the apple

02:42:24,319 --> 02:42:30,560
store it's not because i want we we

02:42:27,680 --> 02:42:31,920
we we want money from you is the problem

02:42:30,560 --> 02:42:35,120
is that maintaining

02:42:31,920 --> 02:42:38,399
that product on the store has a very

02:42:35,120 --> 02:42:39,840
high cost and the the company has to

02:42:38,399 --> 02:42:44,080
cover

02:42:39,840 --> 02:42:47,279
that cost so what we decided to do

02:42:44,080 --> 02:42:50,640
we added the community uh

02:42:47,279 --> 02:42:53,920
label to the libreoffice released by

02:42:50,640 --> 02:42:55,200
the document foundation uh it is not

02:42:53,920 --> 02:42:57,520
that doesn't mean

02:42:55,200 --> 02:42:58,960
it is an open core product that

02:42:57,520 --> 02:43:02,080
libreoffice community

02:42:58,960 --> 02:43:03,359
has exactly the same features of any

02:43:02,080 --> 02:43:08,560
other libreoffice

02:43:03,359 --> 02:43:12,160
uh software we do not release

02:43:08,560 --> 02:43:15,920
software with different features so

02:43:12,160 --> 02:43:15,920
what can happen is that

02:43:16,319 --> 02:43:24,399
there are features that are developed

02:43:20,399 --> 02:43:26,800
that are developed and paid by a company

02:43:24,399 --> 02:43:28,880
and there might be a version of

02:43:26,800 --> 02:43:31,120
libreoffice released by

02:43:28,880 --> 02:43:32,479
the company that has developed that

02:43:31,120 --> 02:43:35,600
features

02:43:32,479 --> 02:43:39,040
uh for instance collaborator

02:43:35,600 --> 02:43:42,479
which are the two biggest one that for

02:43:39,040 --> 02:43:45,920
a few months offers that feature

02:43:42,479 --> 02:43:49,359
just because it has not been merged

02:43:45,920 --> 02:43:52,399
on on the main repository but this is

02:43:49,359 --> 02:43:55,200
just a case it's not for all feature

02:43:52,399 --> 02:43:57,120
and can only happen in some cases where

02:43:55,200 --> 02:44:00,240
the feature was big

02:43:57,120 --> 02:44:04,080
and uh was not easy to develop

02:44:00,240 --> 02:44:06,080
and it has to be tested then we have the

02:44:04,080 --> 02:44:09,439
libreoffice enterprise

02:44:06,080 --> 02:44:14,080
umbrella name from ecosystem members

02:44:09,439 --> 02:44:17,439
at the moment it is not widely used but

02:44:14,080 --> 02:44:21,040
that means that libreoffice enterprise

02:44:17,439 --> 02:44:23,640
is professionally supported if a company

02:44:21,040 --> 02:44:27,520
wants uh

02:44:23,640 --> 02:44:29,520
24x7 support cannot expect this from

02:44:27,520 --> 02:44:33,680
on libreoffice community they have to

02:44:29,520 --> 02:44:36,319
look at libreoffice enterprise

02:44:33,680 --> 02:44:37,279
so these are this clarifies a little bit

02:44:36,319 --> 02:44:41,279
about

02:44:37,279 --> 02:44:43,520
the versions and the users um

02:44:41,279 --> 02:44:46,479
of course you can use the libreoffice

02:44:43,520 --> 02:44:49,680
community on a large migration but then

02:44:46,479 --> 02:44:52,960
do not ask to have your

02:44:49,680 --> 02:44:54,960
back solved in one day because this will

02:44:52,960 --> 02:44:56,880
not happen

02:44:54,960 --> 02:44:58,479
libreoffice community is supported with

02:44:56,880 --> 02:45:00,960
donations

02:44:58,479 --> 02:45:02,880
unfortunately there are many many many

02:45:00,960 --> 02:45:04,800
free riders with that version

02:45:02,880 --> 02:45:07,680
many universities many government

02:45:04,800 --> 02:45:10,000
organizations many enterprises

02:45:07,680 --> 02:45:11,120
that number should really should be

02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:13,680
reduced

02:45:11,120 --> 02:45:15,359
we know that we there will always be

02:45:13,680 --> 02:45:17,840
some free riders

02:45:15,359 --> 02:45:20,000
but we cannot have 95 percent of free

02:45:17,840 --> 02:45:22,319
riders and five percent of

02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:23,920
enterprises develop the project that's

02:45:22,319 --> 02:45:27,040
not fair

02:45:23,920 --> 02:45:29,040
for the five percent it's not fair for

02:45:27,040 --> 02:45:33,359
the project

02:45:29,040 --> 02:45:36,720
uh and uh libreoffice enterprise is a

02:45:33,359 --> 02:45:38,479
product for purchase the the the price

02:45:36,720 --> 02:45:42,000
is not comparable

02:45:38,479 --> 02:45:46,880
with the microsoft office price

02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:46,880
it is a typical open source

02:45:47,760 --> 02:45:52,240
commercial open source price

02:45:54,840 --> 02:45:59,439
again uh this to make it clear that

02:45:57,680 --> 02:46:02,640
libreoffice enterprise is

02:45:59,439 --> 02:46:04,960
not a new product it's just a family

02:46:02,640 --> 02:46:06,240
name to associate to make it easier to

02:46:04,960 --> 02:46:10,720
associate

02:46:06,240 --> 02:46:13,359
this with the ecosystem companies

02:46:10,720 --> 02:46:14,399
how we support libreoffice enterprise we

02:46:13,359 --> 02:46:17,279
have a

02:46:14,399 --> 02:46:17,920
web page we have improved the download

02:46:17,279 --> 02:46:20,399
page

02:46:17,920 --> 02:46:21,760
we have a linkedin page libreoffice

02:46:20,399 --> 02:46:23,520
enterprise

02:46:21,760 --> 02:46:25,040
we will relaunch the brofist

02:46:23,520 --> 02:46:29,200
certification

02:46:25,040 --> 02:46:30,319
with specific attention for libreoffice

02:46:29,200 --> 02:46:32,720
enterprise

02:46:30,319 --> 02:46:34,160
we have registered business oriented

02:46:32,720 --> 02:46:37,120
domains at the moment they

02:46:34,160 --> 02:46:39,920
are redirecting but in the future there

02:46:37,120 --> 02:46:42,960
will be specific page there

02:46:39,920 --> 02:46:45,840
uh that's the business web page

02:46:42,960 --> 02:46:46,560
that the libreoffice download you see we

02:46:45,840 --> 02:46:49,040
have a

02:46:46,560 --> 02:46:51,120
business users click here and only

02:46:49,040 --> 02:46:51,520
because we are the business business use

02:46:51,120 --> 02:46:54,720
it

02:46:51,520 --> 02:46:57,760
uh click here we add up the

02:46:54,720 --> 02:47:00,000
the the number of clicks to for the

02:46:57,760 --> 02:47:03,520
libreoffice enterprise page

02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:04,479
was multiplied by 10. so in many cases

02:47:03,520 --> 02:47:07,680
just a fact of

02:47:04,479 --> 02:47:11,439
not being informed

02:47:07,680 --> 02:47:13,600
this is linked in libreoffice enterprise

02:47:11,439 --> 02:47:15,040
this is the libreoffice certification

02:47:13,600 --> 02:47:17,279
page

02:47:15,040 --> 02:47:20,160
if you are supporting libreoffice look

02:47:17,279 --> 02:47:22,640
at the certification we are

02:47:20,160 --> 02:47:22,640
about

02:47:23,520 --> 02:47:29,200
we would like to certify you to make it

02:47:26,720 --> 02:47:29,200
wider

02:47:31,439 --> 02:47:38,720
this is what we are doing in terms of

02:47:34,560 --> 02:47:42,000
summary we will

02:47:38,720 --> 02:47:45,520
launch an education campaign specific

02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:49,279
about sustainability of

02:47:45,520 --> 02:47:52,319
libreoffice of open source

02:47:49,279 --> 02:47:55,520
project this will

02:47:52,319 --> 02:47:58,560
probably start in in in june

02:47:55,520 --> 02:48:00,399
with interviews podcast thank you for

02:47:58,560 --> 02:48:03,600
listening

02:48:00,399 --> 02:48:05,439
and i will look at the question now to

02:48:03,600 --> 02:48:07,040
see if there is something that i can

02:48:05,439 --> 02:48:10,000
answer

02:48:07,040 --> 02:48:12,800
uh why is not fair for the the to the

02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:16,080
five percent not to pay for libreoffice

02:48:12,800 --> 02:48:16,720
because if you are an enterprise and

02:48:16,080 --> 02:48:20,399
therefore

02:48:16,720 --> 02:48:22,160
you replace a product like microsoft

02:48:20,399 --> 02:48:25,920
office and you pay

02:48:22,160 --> 02:48:26,960
hundreds of euros every year for each

02:48:25,920 --> 02:48:29,120
user

02:48:26,960 --> 02:48:30,080
i don't think it's fair for the five

02:48:29,120 --> 02:48:34,800
percent that

02:48:30,080 --> 02:48:38,640
pays for the and the development of

02:48:34,800 --> 02:48:41,600
enterprise features to

02:48:38,640 --> 02:48:42,720
not to support at all the free

02:48:41,600 --> 02:48:45,760
libreoffice

02:48:42,720 --> 02:48:46,080
so you can if you if you for instance if

02:48:45,760 --> 02:48:49,359
you

02:48:46,080 --> 02:48:52,399
don't you don't want to uh to

02:48:49,359 --> 02:48:55,439
to pay for uh bug solving bugs

02:48:52,399 --> 02:48:56,000
or developing features fair enough you

02:48:55,439 --> 02:48:58,640
can

02:48:56,000 --> 02:49:00,240
buy the long-term supported version from

02:48:58,640 --> 02:49:03,760
a company

02:49:00,240 --> 02:49:08,720
and by paying

02:49:03,760 --> 02:49:12,800
those few euros per seat per year

02:49:08,720 --> 02:49:14,720
you will allow that company to invest

02:49:12,800 --> 02:49:16,560
the time of their developers in the

02:49:14,720 --> 02:49:19,520
development of

02:49:16,560 --> 02:49:21,920
features in the development in solving

02:49:19,520 --> 02:49:21,920
bugs

02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:27,920
what we say is is that we completely

02:49:25,120 --> 02:49:29,920
understand and the fact that we are not

02:49:27,920 --> 02:49:33,279
changing the license

02:49:29,920 --> 02:49:38,319
uh is that we

02:49:33,279 --> 02:49:41,520
do not want uh we do not want to

02:49:38,319 --> 02:49:45,200
change the license to make it permissive

02:49:41,520 --> 02:49:48,160
to make it we want to stay copy left

02:49:45,200 --> 02:49:49,520
and this of course brings with it a

02:49:48,160 --> 02:49:53,359
number of free riders

02:49:49,520 --> 02:49:57,279
of the uh or if you want takers

02:49:53,359 --> 02:50:01,040
of the libreoffice product

02:49:57,279 --> 02:50:01,040
but we don't want

02:50:03,359 --> 02:50:08,640
we don't want to allow

02:50:06,479 --> 02:50:10,399
companies for instance by going with a

02:50:08,640 --> 02:50:14,000
permissive license

02:50:10,399 --> 02:50:17,200
to make it proprietary in the future uh

02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:18,319
because that is uh what exactly what we

02:50:17,200 --> 02:50:21,600
find it when we

02:50:18,319 --> 02:50:23,439
we decided to to create libreoffice and

02:50:21,600 --> 02:50:25,439
it's not by chance

02:50:23,439 --> 02:50:27,439
that open apache open office has a

02:50:25,439 --> 02:50:31,279
permissive license this is what

02:50:27,439 --> 02:50:32,960
ibm wanted because they wanted to kill

02:50:31,279 --> 02:50:34,840
libreoffice and they thought that a

02:50:32,960 --> 02:50:36,319
permissive license could kill

02:50:34,840 --> 02:50:40,080
libreoffice

02:50:36,319 --> 02:50:42,399
so we don't see any other license

02:50:40,080 --> 02:50:45,279
than a copyleft license at the moment we

02:50:42,399 --> 02:50:48,080
are mozilla public license and uh

02:50:45,279 --> 02:50:48,080
lgpl

02:50:48,720 --> 02:50:52,479
we would like to have more enterprises

02:50:51,520 --> 02:50:55,680
to support

02:50:52,479 --> 02:50:58,319
the product we want to use some moral

02:50:55,680 --> 02:51:01,200
sushi on we want to use some education

02:50:58,319 --> 02:51:01,760
we don't want to use other means that

02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:04,240
are

02:51:01,760 --> 02:51:05,279
restrictive because that is not would

02:51:04,240 --> 02:51:07,840
not be

02:51:05,279 --> 02:51:08,880
free open source software this would be

02:51:07,840 --> 02:51:11,279
an excuse

02:51:08,880 --> 02:51:13,359
to have a the free open source software

02:51:11,279 --> 02:51:16,160
would be an excuse

02:51:13,359 --> 02:51:17,359
for a commercial strategy and that is

02:51:16,160 --> 02:51:20,960
not what we want

02:51:17,359 --> 02:51:24,319
we want to stay loyal to our

02:51:20,960 --> 02:51:27,520
uh open source principle to

02:51:24,319 --> 02:51:31,840
our software freedom principles

02:51:27,520 --> 02:51:35,680
and that is what we really look forward

02:51:31,840 --> 02:51:35,680
of course we know that it's not easy

02:51:38,640 --> 02:51:42,399
and we

02:51:42,479 --> 02:51:50,880
and we really don't want to

02:51:47,040 --> 02:51:50,880
change our license

02:51:51,680 --> 02:51:53,920
so

02:51:55,120 --> 02:51:59,120
why we did we took the decision it this

02:51:58,560 --> 02:52:01,200
is so

02:51:59,120 --> 02:52:02,720
sorry but it's off topic but i will

02:52:01,200 --> 02:52:05,840
answer that

02:52:02,720 --> 02:52:09,279
uh because we

02:52:05,840 --> 02:52:12,080
think that the way that

02:52:09,279 --> 02:52:14,319
free software foundation is behaving is

02:52:12,080 --> 02:52:17,840
not transparent at all

02:52:14,319 --> 02:52:22,399
in terms of governance and

02:52:17,840 --> 02:52:26,399
we expect and what they've done after

02:52:22,399 --> 02:52:29,600
the all the comments have been raised

02:52:26,399 --> 02:52:31,760
is not personal to richard stallman is

02:52:29,600 --> 02:52:33,680
not personal to anyone

02:52:31,760 --> 02:52:35,760
the problem is that we think that the

02:52:33,680 --> 02:52:36,640
free software foundation if they want to

02:52:35,760 --> 02:52:38,800
be

02:52:36,640 --> 02:52:40,640
the steward of free software they should

02:52:38,800 --> 02:52:45,600
start to be transparent

02:52:40,640 --> 02:52:49,840
to have a a a democratic

02:52:45,600 --> 02:52:54,160
election methodology or

02:52:49,840 --> 02:52:57,279
process they people that are the

02:52:54,160 --> 02:53:00,319
right of vote either they are everyone

02:52:57,279 --> 02:53:02,080
or no one but it should not be just a

02:53:00,319 --> 02:53:06,000
friend of someone

02:53:02,080 --> 02:53:10,080
like it is today and uh so uh

02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:13,120
we for the time being until we

02:53:10,080 --> 02:53:16,399
do not see a change in

02:53:13,120 --> 02:53:18,319
a real change in

02:53:16,399 --> 02:53:20,160
in the governments at free software

02:53:18,319 --> 02:53:23,439
foundation

02:53:20,160 --> 02:53:28,319
we will not this is not going to change

02:53:23,439 --> 02:53:28,319
we will we keep it monitored as that

02:53:29,040 --> 02:53:33,760
our board i'm not a member of the

02:53:31,680 --> 02:53:37,279
document foundation board

02:53:33,760 --> 02:53:40,880
but what the board has decided is to

02:53:37,279 --> 02:53:41,279
re-evaluate the position every six weeks

02:53:40,880 --> 02:53:44,319
which

02:53:41,279 --> 02:53:45,040
means every month and a half based on

02:53:44,319 --> 02:53:52,240
what

02:53:45,040 --> 02:53:55,359
the free software foundation is doing

02:53:52,240 --> 02:53:58,640
and uh yeah some some people

02:53:55,359 --> 02:54:02,080
have already answered my uh

02:53:58,640 --> 02:54:03,200
some of the questions uh we do not have

02:54:02,080 --> 02:54:06,160
a

02:54:03,200 --> 02:54:07,600
contributor license agreement but again

02:54:06,160 --> 02:54:13,279
we do not want to go

02:54:07,600 --> 02:54:13,279
permissive it's not because we because

02:54:13,439 --> 02:54:17,279
open office had a contributor license

02:54:16,560 --> 02:54:20,560
agreement

02:54:17,279 --> 02:54:23,520
and a permission copy left license

02:54:20,560 --> 02:54:25,439
we want we do not want to have a

02:54:23,520 --> 02:54:27,760
contributor license agreement and

02:54:25,439 --> 02:54:29,439
we want to have a copy left license full

02:54:27,760 --> 02:54:32,880
stop

02:54:29,439 --> 02:54:36,160
so no permissive and no other licenses

02:54:32,880 --> 02:54:40,080
and i think i'm done in terms of timing

02:54:36,160 --> 02:54:41,840
and i've also answered some questions i

02:54:40,080 --> 02:54:44,720
don't know if

02:54:41,840 --> 02:54:45,359
how the organizers would like to manage

02:54:44,720 --> 02:54:49,120
this

02:54:45,359 --> 02:54:53,120
i'm done for the uh

02:54:49,120 --> 02:54:55,200
and i think in time uh for my talk

02:54:53,120 --> 02:54:56,720
yes thank you very much for your talk it

02:54:59,760 --> 02:55:03,600
shared note unfortunately we are running

02:55:03,600 --> 02:55:06,479
could maybe reply or take a look at some

02:55:05,600 --> 02:55:08,399

it should be there already just give me

02:56:06,160 --> 02:56:13,200
one second to check

02:56:08,960 --> 02:56:15,279
okay you should now have presentation

02:56:13,200 --> 02:56:17,600
start a poll share upload the

02:56:15,279 --> 02:56:20,399
presentation

02:56:17,600 --> 02:56:20,399
slide one

02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:27,840
i'm only seeing the linux absolute thing

02:56:53,200 --> 02:56:56,720
i'm sorry but i don't see my

02:56:54,560 --> 02:56:59,920
presentation i don't also don't have a

02:56:56,720 --> 02:56:59,920
button anymore to upload the

02:57:06,840 --> 02:57:09,840
presentation

02:57:20,840 --> 02:57:23,840
uh

02:57:33,120 --> 02:57:37,200
yeah you can share your screen if this

02:57:35,040 --> 02:57:38,640
is easier for you

02:57:37,200 --> 02:57:41,359
because apparently it's not uploading

02:57:38,640 --> 02:57:45,680
because of the file size

02:57:41,359 --> 02:57:47,840
okay i don't think it was

02:57:45,680 --> 02:57:51,680
i'm trying to upload it now and it seems

02:57:47,840 --> 02:57:54,800
to be running

02:57:51,680 --> 02:57:56,720
there we are yes so

02:57:54,800 --> 02:57:58,640
welcome everybody i'm holland and i've

02:57:56,720 --> 02:58:02,479
been the maintainer of krita since

02:57:58,640 --> 02:58:04,479
2004. and in this presentation i will

02:58:02,479 --> 02:58:05,520
talk briefly about what creator is what

02:58:04,479 --> 02:58:07,200
makes it special

02:58:05,520 --> 02:58:09,279
i will give a history of how we've tried

02:58:07,200 --> 02:58:11,760
to find creatures development

02:58:09,279 --> 02:58:12,399
the experience we had and what's special

02:58:11,760 --> 02:58:15,200
about

02:58:12,399 --> 02:58:16,399
trying to find development in the linux

02:58:15,200 --> 02:58:19,279
ecosystem

02:58:16,399 --> 02:58:21,279
so gita is what i call a big application

02:58:19,279 --> 02:58:22,399
it's an application people used to make

02:58:21,279 --> 02:58:25,439
money with

02:58:22,399 --> 02:58:27,040
and that's really sort of of of a core

02:58:25,439 --> 02:58:28,319
thing because if people can make money

02:58:27,040 --> 02:58:30,560
with your application

02:58:28,319 --> 02:58:32,319
you can ask them to give you money make

02:58:30,560 --> 02:58:33,520
sure can they use to finish your

02:58:32,319 --> 02:58:37,439
application

02:58:33,520 --> 02:58:39,200
so right now we are finding nine people

02:58:37,439 --> 02:58:42,080
to work on krita

02:58:39,200 --> 02:58:42,960
full time it's not as big as blenders

02:58:42,080 --> 02:58:45,439
team

02:58:42,960 --> 02:58:47,040
but it's much larger than another big

02:58:45,439 --> 02:58:47,520
applications in the open source world

02:58:47,040 --> 02:58:51,200
like

02:58:47,520 --> 02:58:52,399
inkscape or scribus or personally i

02:58:51,200 --> 02:58:54,720
think that more

02:58:52,399 --> 02:58:55,520
projects should consider doing what we

02:58:54,720 --> 02:58:58,840
do

02:58:55,520 --> 02:59:01,200
and if i'm honest then i have to admit

02:58:58,840 --> 02:59:03,600
that what we do

02:59:01,200 --> 02:59:04,399
is just straight out copies from blender

02:59:03,600 --> 02:59:06,880
you'll find

02:59:04,399 --> 02:59:09,200
a couple of places where that's really

02:59:06,880 --> 02:59:09,200
clear

02:59:09,279 --> 02:59:19,600
so it all started in 2007

02:59:15,439 --> 02:59:22,399
back at that time we needed money to

02:59:19,600 --> 02:59:24,240
get some tablets to test krita with at

02:59:22,399 --> 02:59:26,160
that time q didn't have support for

02:59:24,240 --> 02:59:27,040
tablets we had to write it for ourselves

02:59:26,160 --> 02:59:31,840
and

02:59:27,040 --> 02:59:35,120
we just didn't have any any hardware

02:59:31,840 --> 02:59:39,279
i'm pasting this from linux weekly news

02:59:35,120 --> 02:59:39,279
because the dot carrier

02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:43,600
post has gone it's it's unreadable by

02:59:43,120 --> 02:59:45,520
now

02:59:43,600 --> 02:59:47,680
i think that linux we can use really

02:59:45,520 --> 02:59:50,880
needs to get a bit more exposure

02:59:47,680 --> 02:59:52,960
it's sort of of the memory of our

02:59:50,880 --> 02:59:55,520
community

02:59:52,960 --> 02:59:57,840
so what's the success yes it was a

02:59:55,520 --> 02:59:59,120
success we got two tablets two art pens

02:59:57,840 --> 03:00:01,359
two roller pants

02:59:59,120 --> 03:00:02,880
uh we've lost the art pens but the

03:00:01,359 --> 03:00:05,279
normal pens and the tablets are still in

03:00:02,880 --> 03:00:08,399
use we're still testing with them

03:00:05,279 --> 03:00:10,240
uh so that was

03:00:08,399 --> 03:00:12,960
already impressive especially if you

03:00:10,240 --> 03:00:16,720
consider that back then in 2007

03:00:12,960 --> 03:00:18,800
we just did not have a user base in 2006

03:00:16,720 --> 03:00:19,920
david rivoir for the first time tried

03:00:18,800 --> 03:00:22,960
krita and told us

03:00:19,920 --> 03:00:24,000
i can't work with this and then in 2007

03:00:22,960 --> 03:00:26,399
we started rewriting

03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:29,359
everything which was stupid but it was

03:00:26,399 --> 03:00:32,720
the big q3 to q84 move

03:00:29,359 --> 03:00:34,880
and i guess what i mean

03:00:32,720 --> 03:00:39,840
with this is it's amazing that without a

03:00:34,880 --> 03:00:39,840
user base we already got so much support

03:00:44,080 --> 03:00:50,000
so fast forward to 2009

03:00:47,120 --> 03:00:52,000
we have been rewriting krita for three

03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:55,359
or four years

03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:58,080
and there were so many bad books

03:00:55,359 --> 03:01:00,000
and we couldn't get the books fixed and

03:00:58,080 --> 03:01:01,120
then one of our community members lucas

03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:04,160
trudy

03:01:01,120 --> 03:01:07,359
from slovakia he came up with an idea he

03:01:04,160 --> 03:01:09,520
was going to finish his university

03:01:07,359 --> 03:01:11,600
and between ranking thesis and last

03:01:09,520 --> 03:01:14,880
classes he would have a couple of notes

03:01:11,600 --> 03:01:17,359
where he was looking for a side job

03:01:14,880 --> 03:01:17,920
again this was really early in the day

03:01:17,359 --> 03:01:21,040
and

03:01:17,920 --> 03:01:23,680
we didn't have much of a user base and

03:01:21,040 --> 03:01:24,720
our releases were source only so it was

03:01:23,680 --> 03:01:26,880
really the

03:01:24,720 --> 03:01:27,920
the linux community the kde community

03:01:26,880 --> 03:01:30,880
that rallied

03:01:27,920 --> 03:01:31,520
around our project and brought in enough

03:01:30,880 --> 03:01:33,760
money

03:01:31,520 --> 03:01:36,720
to make it possible for lucas to start

03:01:33,760 --> 03:01:36,720
working on krita

03:01:40,479 --> 03:01:43,760
and that's i think when we first got a

03:01:42,399 --> 03:01:45,520
test of what it meant

03:01:43,760 --> 03:01:47,600
to have someone working full time on

03:01:45,520 --> 03:01:48,399
your project because those books got

03:01:47,600 --> 03:01:51,279
fixed

03:01:48,399 --> 03:01:53,439
those performance issues got fixed and

03:01:51,279 --> 03:01:55,120
that was a really good feeling

03:01:53,439 --> 03:01:57,279
pretty soon we would have a version of

03:01:55,120 --> 03:01:59,680
creator that users would actually like

03:01:57,279 --> 03:01:59,680
to use

03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:03,200
what we also did this is copied from

03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:06,240
blender and

03:02:03,200 --> 03:02:10,240
back then about 10 years ago

03:02:06,240 --> 03:02:12,319
dvds were still thin and we decided to

03:02:10,240 --> 03:02:14,640
start making training dvds

03:02:12,319 --> 03:02:15,520
krita had gotten good enough that people

03:02:14,640 --> 03:02:18,399
could use it

03:02:15,520 --> 03:02:19,680
that training stuff would be useful so

03:02:18,399 --> 03:02:22,960
over the years we

03:02:19,680 --> 03:02:24,479
created a bunch of dvds and animate with

03:02:22,960 --> 03:02:26,240
krita secrets of krita

03:02:24,479 --> 03:02:27,840
the music streaming dvd which is

03:02:26,240 --> 03:02:29,279
actually still getting sold now and then

03:02:27,840 --> 03:02:32,160
as a download

03:02:29,279 --> 03:02:33,680
the latest on digital attorney and the

03:02:32,160 --> 03:02:36,720
way this works is

03:02:33,680 --> 03:02:38,319
i agree with the authors of these these

03:02:36,720 --> 03:02:41,120
dvds ramon miranda

03:02:38,319 --> 03:02:42,080
or tim digiette that i will pay them a

03:02:41,120 --> 03:02:44,720
limp soon

03:02:42,080 --> 03:02:45,520
for doing the work and then we will

03:02:44,720 --> 03:02:49,200
release it

03:02:45,520 --> 03:02:51,120
and as soon as it started earning out

03:02:49,200 --> 03:02:53,680
everything is gravy

03:02:51,120 --> 03:02:56,240
the big problem of course is that

03:02:53,680 --> 03:02:57,840
everyone goes to youtube these days

03:02:56,240 --> 03:03:00,319
which means that we are now sponsoring

03:02:57,840 --> 03:03:01,600
ramon miranda to do a monthly video on

03:03:00,319 --> 03:03:05,359
youtube for krita

03:03:01,600 --> 03:03:07,439
which doesn't bring us any money at all

03:03:05,359 --> 03:03:08,640
it just costs money but it's what people

03:03:07,439 --> 03:03:11,840
go and look for

03:03:08,640 --> 03:03:13,040
for training these days that's that uh

03:03:11,840 --> 03:03:15,600
selling off of

03:03:13,040 --> 03:03:16,240
sales of these training materials still

03:03:15,600 --> 03:03:18,720
keeps me

03:03:16,240 --> 03:03:18,720
in money

03:03:21,600 --> 03:03:26,800
so another thing that i wanted to

03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:29,439
mention about youtube is that

03:03:26,800 --> 03:03:30,080
we when we started doing fundraisers

03:03:29,439 --> 03:03:31,840
were

03:03:30,080 --> 03:03:34,000
really surprised at how important

03:03:31,840 --> 03:03:36,720
youtube is

03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:38,560
most of the referrals to kickstarter

03:03:36,720 --> 03:03:42,160
actually came from youtube

03:03:38,560 --> 03:03:42,160
during every kickstarter campaign

03:03:42,720 --> 03:03:51,200
then we have to make a digression

03:03:47,120 --> 03:03:53,520
2012 i started working

03:03:51,200 --> 03:03:56,319
with two partners at the company called

03:03:53,520 --> 03:04:00,319
klgmh we were working on

03:03:56,319 --> 03:04:03,920
a version of calico office or gay office

03:04:00,319 --> 03:04:08,000
back then for nokia and

03:04:03,920 --> 03:04:11,279
at one point we started thinking well

03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:13,200
if krita was part of k office back then

03:04:11,279 --> 03:04:15,120
if my company also starts doing

03:04:13,200 --> 03:04:15,840
creator-related stuff maybe it will want

03:04:15,120 --> 03:04:20,080
to have

03:04:15,840 --> 03:04:22,399
the trademark i can't let that happen so

03:04:20,080 --> 03:04:24,399
we started to create a foundation in

03:04:22,399 --> 03:04:26,160
03:04:24,399 --> 03:04:28,080
because we wanted to be able to own the

03:04:26,160 --> 03:04:29,840
trademark and that was the second reason

03:04:28,080 --> 03:04:33,040
we really needed to get money

03:04:29,840 --> 03:04:36,240
because at that point dimitri

03:04:33,040 --> 03:04:36,720
was going to graduate and dmitry kasich

03:04:36,240 --> 03:04:39,120
office

03:04:36,720 --> 03:04:41,840
is our lead developer and i didn't want

03:04:39,120 --> 03:04:41,840
to lose him

03:04:46,880 --> 03:04:53,600
i'm having window management issues so

03:04:50,560 --> 03:04:53,600
ko gmbh

03:04:54,640 --> 03:05:00,080
we were going to work with intel

03:04:58,080 --> 03:05:01,840
uh on the new version of krita this is

03:05:00,080 --> 03:05:04,080
back when intel

03:05:01,840 --> 03:05:05,680
wanted to get into the tablet business

03:05:04,080 --> 03:05:08,640
because tablets were hot

03:05:05,680 --> 03:05:10,080
it was the days where the days of nico

03:05:08,640 --> 03:05:12,160
and mimo were

03:05:10,080 --> 03:05:14,080
over and they wanted to have a version

03:05:12,160 --> 03:05:15,120
of twitter on windows that was optimized

03:05:14,080 --> 03:05:16,479
for tablets

03:05:15,120 --> 03:05:18,479
and then they wanted to have a version

03:05:16,479 --> 03:05:20,880
of krita that was optimized for

03:05:18,479 --> 03:05:23,439
those dual screen laptops that you can

03:05:20,880 --> 03:05:26,479
fold and

03:05:23,439 --> 03:05:27,600
use as a tablet or as a laptop this was

03:05:26,479 --> 03:05:32,000
quite interesting

03:05:27,600 --> 03:05:34,640
it was also the beginning of of

03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:37,120
twitter and windows it was when we first

03:05:34,640 --> 03:05:40,160
started looking into tablet guise

03:05:37,120 --> 03:05:43,040
and into funded this work and barely

03:05:40,160 --> 03:05:44,800
it wasn't really enough because the way

03:05:43,040 --> 03:05:48,160
a company like into funds

03:05:44,800 --> 03:05:51,279
projects like this is

03:05:48,160 --> 03:05:52,560
by going into partnership and filming

03:05:51,279 --> 03:05:54,960
part of the development

03:05:52,560 --> 03:05:56,560
because the company is supposed to start

03:05:54,960 --> 03:06:01,359
making money

03:05:56,560 --> 03:06:04,080
off the product that into kickstarted

03:06:01,359 --> 03:06:05,520
later on when kojam y8 went broke

03:06:04,080 --> 03:06:09,359
because nokia went down

03:06:05,520 --> 03:06:10,640
uh the krita foundation did some similar

03:06:09,359 --> 03:06:15,840
project with intel

03:06:10,640 --> 03:06:15,840
i will discuss those a bit later on

03:06:16,080 --> 03:06:20,880
and right now there's no money in it

03:06:18,479 --> 03:06:20,880
anymore

03:06:22,240 --> 03:06:26,960
so there was no money and we couldn't

03:06:24,640 --> 03:06:30,080
sell krita because krita's free software

03:06:26,960 --> 03:06:31,120
except we thought if we put krita in an

03:06:30,080 --> 03:06:33,760
app store

03:06:31,120 --> 03:06:35,520
and certainly we were thinking of steam

03:06:33,760 --> 03:06:36,960
probably because we had some employees

03:06:35,520 --> 03:06:38,479
at koch and gage who

03:06:36,960 --> 03:06:40,840
were really into gaming because i

03:06:38,479 --> 03:06:43,680
haven't heard of steam myself

03:06:40,840 --> 03:06:45,600
so we put krita on steam that was quite

03:06:43,680 --> 03:06:47,840
a bit of work steam is not easy

03:06:45,600 --> 03:06:49,520
so we thought well we are fully

03:06:47,840 --> 03:06:51,120
justified in asking for money

03:06:49,520 --> 03:06:53,359
people can still download it if they

03:06:51,120 --> 03:06:56,080
want for free

03:06:53,359 --> 03:06:56,640
and your big bonus is you can have a

03:06:56,080 --> 03:06:59,359
twitter

03:06:56,640 --> 03:07:01,680
in your library on all your devices and

03:06:59,359 --> 03:07:04,880
you will get automatic updates

03:07:01,680 --> 03:07:08,240
and that worked for a bit

03:07:04,880 --> 03:07:09,359
until kogem eight went broke when kmb 8

03:07:08,240 --> 03:07:11,520
went broke

03:07:09,359 --> 03:07:13,200
and we suddenly lost the expertise to do

03:07:11,520 --> 03:07:16,000
updates on steam

03:07:13,200 --> 03:07:16,720
so our unique selling point for this app

03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:19,760
store

03:07:16,720 --> 03:07:21,680
was broken and then we started porting

03:07:19,760 --> 03:07:24,560
creator to qt5 which broke

03:07:21,680 --> 03:07:26,160
our tablet and dual interface version of

03:07:24,560 --> 03:07:27,920
twitter which was the version we were

03:07:26,160 --> 03:07:30,160
putting on steam

03:07:27,920 --> 03:07:32,160
so for quite a long time and i felt

03:07:30,160 --> 03:07:34,960
really bad about that

03:07:32,160 --> 03:07:36,720
we couldn't update krita on steam that

03:07:34,960 --> 03:07:40,319
changed when a couple of years ago

03:07:36,720 --> 03:07:43,520
i volunteered contributor

03:07:40,319 --> 03:07:45,439
emmett asked me well shall i put an

03:07:43,520 --> 03:07:46,080
updated version of crete on steam for

03:07:45,439 --> 03:07:47,520
you

03:07:46,080 --> 03:07:49,200
and i was like if you want to do that

03:07:47,520 --> 03:07:51,359
yes please

03:07:49,200 --> 03:07:55,359
and he's now sponsored to work full-time

03:07:51,359 --> 03:07:55,359
on creator on the animation feature

03:07:57,279 --> 03:08:03,840
steam right now brings in enough money

03:08:00,479 --> 03:08:05,040
to pay three or four very frugal living

03:08:03,840 --> 03:08:08,160
developers

03:08:05,040 --> 03:08:13,200
and we are not getting rich out of this

03:08:08,160 --> 03:08:15,920
at all and it's not going to happen

03:08:13,200 --> 03:08:17,680
and and then there is a problem with all

03:08:15,920 --> 03:08:18,560
app stores and we are now in a couple of

03:08:17,680 --> 03:08:20,880
app stores

03:08:18,560 --> 03:08:22,880
you're practically sharecropping you put

03:08:20,880 --> 03:08:24,800
your application in there and you hope

03:08:22,880 --> 03:08:27,040
to get some money out of it

03:08:24,800 --> 03:08:28,319
and you don't you aren't in touch with

03:08:27,040 --> 03:08:30,479
your customers because

03:08:28,319 --> 03:08:32,160
they're actually false customers not my

03:08:30,479 --> 03:08:36,160
customers

03:08:32,160 --> 03:08:36,160
but it's right now the best we can do

03:08:37,200 --> 03:08:42,319
so steam

03:08:40,319 --> 03:08:43,359
was bringing in a bit of money for kog

03:08:42,319 --> 03:08:45,760
mbh

03:08:43,359 --> 03:08:47,200
but we needed a secret foundation to get

03:08:45,760 --> 03:08:50,720
more money to pay

03:08:47,200 --> 03:08:52,479
dimitri so we went with kickstarter

03:08:50,720 --> 03:08:54,800
these days you don't hear a lot about

03:08:52,479 --> 03:08:56,800
kickstarter anymore

03:08:54,800 --> 03:08:59,600
it used to be that my twitter timeline

03:08:56,800 --> 03:09:02,640
was full of new kickstarter projects

03:08:59,600 --> 03:09:05,680
but 2014 kickstarter was hot

03:09:02,640 --> 03:09:09,120
and we did our first kickstarter

03:09:05,680 --> 03:09:10,720
that went quite well we wanted to get 15

03:09:09,120 --> 03:09:13,680
000 euros we got

03:09:10,720 --> 03:09:15,200
almost 20 000 euros what we did really

03:09:13,680 --> 03:09:17,120
right there was

03:09:15,200 --> 03:09:18,560
have a list of 12 things that our

03:09:17,120 --> 03:09:21,439
backers could vote for

03:09:18,560 --> 03:09:23,120
so we in first place would learn what

03:09:21,439 --> 03:09:25,200
our users find important

03:09:23,120 --> 03:09:26,479
in the second place users really like

03:09:25,200 --> 03:09:28,640
voting because

03:09:26,479 --> 03:09:30,239
it gives them a feeling they have a say

03:09:28,640 --> 03:09:34,319
in

03:09:30,239 --> 03:09:37,359
in in in the project um

03:09:34,319 --> 03:09:38,960
that was lots of fun what wasn't so much

03:09:37,359 --> 03:09:41,920
fun was

03:09:38,960 --> 03:09:43,359
back already back then but it got worse

03:09:41,920 --> 03:09:45,439
the expectation that

03:09:43,359 --> 03:09:47,200
if your kickstarter doesn't reach the

03:09:45,439 --> 03:09:50,720
goal in

03:09:47,200 --> 03:09:52,239
say two days it's a failure of course it

03:09:50,720 --> 03:09:54,800
isn't a failure if you just get your

03:09:52,239 --> 03:09:58,479
money but that's that's the perception

03:09:54,800 --> 03:10:00,560
um for this this kickstarter

03:09:58,479 --> 03:10:02,160
we actually went a bit overboard with

03:10:00,560 --> 03:10:04,560
goodies

03:10:02,160 --> 03:10:06,080
which is a problem in two ways because

03:10:04,560 --> 03:10:09,120
goodies cost money

03:10:06,080 --> 03:10:11,439
there are pain to se to send out

03:10:09,120 --> 03:10:12,800
and later on it actually turned out that

03:10:11,439 --> 03:10:15,520
the tax authority

03:10:12,800 --> 03:10:17,600
might consider kickstarter goodies to be

03:10:15,520 --> 03:10:19,680
sales instead of donations

03:10:17,600 --> 03:10:22,800
that doesn't happen for us but that's

03:10:19,680 --> 03:10:22,800
something to keep in mind

03:10:22,880 --> 03:10:27,520
as a marketing campaign getting your

03:10:25,040 --> 03:10:30,160
project attention a kickstarter was

03:10:27,520 --> 03:10:30,160
fantastic

03:10:32,399 --> 03:10:39,200
so we did it again the year after

03:10:35,760 --> 03:10:42,160
krg mbh had come gone down

03:10:39,200 --> 03:10:43,520
i had to take consultancy jobs first

03:10:42,160 --> 03:10:46,640
with blue systems

03:10:43,520 --> 03:10:49,520
then with qb and

03:10:46,640 --> 03:10:50,800
honestly during the kickstarter next to

03:10:49,520 --> 03:10:53,840
a full-time job

03:10:50,800 --> 03:10:54,479
it's pretty much impossible it's nerve

03:10:53,840 --> 03:10:59,040
wracking

03:10:54,479 --> 03:10:59,040
it's exhausting it's really hard

03:10:59,279 --> 03:11:03,200
but we got more money we this time we

03:11:01,279 --> 03:11:05,760
got 30 000 euros

03:11:03,200 --> 03:11:07,520
50 percent more of course we also had

03:11:05,760 --> 03:11:10,640
more costs

03:11:07,520 --> 03:11:11,439
because we had more backers kickstarter

03:11:10,640 --> 03:11:13,359
started

03:11:11,439 --> 03:11:14,880
looking more and more like a real

03:11:13,359 --> 03:11:18,399
problem

03:11:14,880 --> 03:11:22,239
so 2016 was the last kickstarter

03:11:18,399 --> 03:11:25,600
and this is a bit of a sad deal

03:11:22,239 --> 03:11:26,720
we wanted to make a really good text

03:11:25,600 --> 03:11:29,040
tool

03:11:26,720 --> 03:11:31,279
and we wanted to make our factor layers

03:11:29,040 --> 03:11:34,319
really good

03:11:31,279 --> 03:11:36,800
we got about 40 000 euros

03:11:34,319 --> 03:11:38,160
which again was more than the year

03:11:36,800 --> 03:11:41,520
before

03:11:38,160 --> 03:11:45,439
but it did not feel right anymore

03:11:41,520 --> 03:11:48,479
uh you get a lot a lot a lot of

03:11:45,439 --> 03:11:49,359
of spam if you're doing kickstarter i'm

03:11:48,479 --> 03:11:52,080
still getting

03:11:49,359 --> 03:11:53,359
mail from people back to 2014

03:11:52,080 --> 03:11:55,279
kickstarter telling me

03:11:53,359 --> 03:11:57,200
oh this is my address and i would like

03:11:55,279 --> 03:12:02,160
to have this booty

03:11:57,200 --> 03:12:02,160
sorry you're too late i'm sorry so sorry

03:12:02,800 --> 03:12:06,239
so we also get something different in

03:12:05,080 --> 03:12:08,000
03:12:06,239 --> 03:12:09,760
this was also inspired by blender

03:12:08,000 --> 03:12:11,359
blender has changed fantastic

03:12:09,760 --> 03:12:13,359
open content projects where they are

03:12:11,359 --> 03:12:14,880
making a movie and i thought well we can

03:12:13,359 --> 03:12:18,239
do that too we are going to make an

03:12:14,880 --> 03:12:21,439
art book and

03:12:18,239 --> 03:12:22,800
because we just wanted to do this not to

03:12:21,439 --> 03:12:26,080
give people

03:12:22,800 --> 03:12:28,319
um exposure artist exposure

03:12:26,080 --> 03:12:29,840
we actually commissioned six artists to

03:12:28,319 --> 03:12:32,640
create art

03:12:29,840 --> 03:12:34,239
with krita for the art book and we

03:12:32,640 --> 03:12:36,720
actually paid them

03:12:34,239 --> 03:12:38,880
and then we got also a lot of of

03:12:36,720 --> 03:12:41,279
contributions from other artists

03:12:38,880 --> 03:12:42,800
we made a really nice part book it took

03:12:41,279 --> 03:12:45,600
me months of work

03:12:42,800 --> 03:12:47,200
months that i couldn't spend coding so

03:12:45,600 --> 03:12:50,399
if you want to fund

03:12:47,200 --> 03:12:52,239
your project through something like this

03:12:50,399 --> 03:12:53,439
you really should have a separate team

03:12:52,239 --> 03:12:56,880
that does this

03:12:53,439 --> 03:12:57,520
and not think oh i'm the project

03:12:56,880 --> 03:13:01,840
maintainer

03:12:57,520 --> 03:13:01,840
i can do this no problem

03:13:02,319 --> 03:13:09,439
we recently at foster 2019

03:13:06,640 --> 03:13:10,160
got rid of the last art books because

03:13:09,439 --> 03:13:13,359
what i hadn't

03:13:10,160 --> 03:13:15,359
realized that was so stupid i put an

03:13:13,359 --> 03:13:18,960
expiry date on the art book

03:13:15,359 --> 03:13:22,000
i put 2016 on it

03:13:18,960 --> 03:13:22,000
that was not smart

03:13:23,760 --> 03:13:30,640
then 2017 this is a word of warning

03:13:27,600 --> 03:13:32,640
if you want to start collecting funds to

03:13:30,640 --> 03:13:36,000
fund your project

03:13:32,640 --> 03:13:39,279
then get an accountant a good one

03:13:36,000 --> 03:13:39,279
the one i had was not good

03:13:39,600 --> 03:13:43,120
it turns out that if at least in the

03:13:42,319 --> 03:13:46,479
netherlands

03:13:43,120 --> 03:13:48,960
if you do sales as part of a non-profit

03:13:46,479 --> 03:13:53,359
foundation

03:13:48,960 --> 03:13:57,359
you cannot reclaim cat anymore

03:13:53,359 --> 03:14:00,800
which meant that the vt of dmitry's work

03:13:57,359 --> 03:14:01,520
which had was transferred from russia to

03:14:00,800 --> 03:14:03,279
the netherlands

03:14:01,520 --> 03:14:05,760
which i wouldn't have expected either in

03:14:03,279 --> 03:14:09,439
my accountant didn't know about

03:14:05,760 --> 03:14:10,800
suddenly became due in 2017 i just

03:14:09,439 --> 03:14:14,399
basically spent all my time

03:14:10,800 --> 03:14:17,600
entangling this mess and now we've got

03:14:14,399 --> 03:14:18,319
a separate company that handles things

03:14:17,600 --> 03:14:20,640
like sales

03:14:18,319 --> 03:14:22,840
in the steam store in the windows store

03:14:20,640 --> 03:14:25,680
and merchandise

03:14:22,840 --> 03:14:26,399
and training materials and we've got a

03:14:25,680 --> 03:14:29,840
foundation

03:14:26,399 --> 03:14:32,319
which only gets donations since it only

03:14:29,840 --> 03:14:36,160
gets donations

03:14:32,319 --> 03:14:38,399
it doesn't have a it's based pat

03:14:36,160 --> 03:14:39,200
in the country where it purchases

03:14:38,399 --> 03:14:41,600
services

03:14:39,200 --> 03:14:43,279
i purchased nutrient work near solution

03:14:41,600 --> 03:14:44,000
and russia there is no vat on

03:14:43,279 --> 03:14:46,560
programming

03:14:44,000 --> 03:14:48,479
so i don't have to pay vat same for

03:14:46,560 --> 03:14:51,040
emerton owen who are in oregon

03:14:48,479 --> 03:14:53,680
in the united states there is no vat in

03:14:51,040 --> 03:14:55,760
all regions so that's fine

03:14:53,680 --> 03:14:57,439
this is really something that that

03:14:55,760 --> 03:14:59,520
that's

03:14:57,439 --> 03:15:00,720
that's really important to stress and i

03:14:59,520 --> 03:15:02,960
should have noticed that blender

03:15:00,720 --> 03:15:05,279
actually has the same separation between

03:15:02,960 --> 03:15:06,080
our foundation and the company we now

03:15:05,279 --> 03:15:09,680
have

03:15:06,080 --> 03:15:11,600
and kd is thinking of

03:15:09,680 --> 03:15:13,200
finding ways to find more development

03:15:11,600 --> 03:15:15,680
and my recommendation was

03:15:13,200 --> 03:15:18,640
set up a separate company but that

03:15:15,680 --> 03:15:18,640
company should not

03:15:19,200 --> 03:15:26,880
um do work but that's the point i will

03:15:23,279 --> 03:15:29,279
talk about later on so in 2017

03:15:26,880 --> 03:15:30,160
when everything was looking really bleak

03:15:29,279 --> 03:15:33,279
um

03:15:30,160 --> 03:15:35,439
we were running out of money until

03:15:33,279 --> 03:15:36,960
the community and again it was mostly

03:15:35,439 --> 03:15:38,720
the linux and free software community

03:15:36,960 --> 03:15:41,760
that rallied around us

03:15:38,720 --> 03:15:45,600
and we didn't do a fundraiser

03:15:41,760 --> 03:15:48,640
to to pay the tax bill because the tax

03:15:45,600 --> 03:15:51,840
bill was paid for us

03:15:48,640 --> 03:15:53,120
a vpn company pi just approaching on the

03:15:51,840 --> 03:15:56,479
internet

03:15:53,120 --> 03:16:00,000
oh shall we pay everything for you

03:15:56,479 --> 03:16:03,040
are you spamming me no it's serious

03:16:00,000 --> 03:16:05,760
you're serious thank you thank you and

03:16:03,040 --> 03:16:08,880
and donations started coming in

03:16:05,760 --> 03:16:11,120
so in the end we had twice as much money

03:16:08,880 --> 03:16:12,800
as we had before but we felt we weren't

03:16:11,120 --> 03:16:15,439
going to do a fundraiser

03:16:12,800 --> 03:16:17,200
what then happened is that i noticed on

03:16:15,439 --> 03:16:18,800
the inkscape mainly list

03:16:17,200 --> 03:16:20,319
that some microsoft people had

03:16:18,800 --> 03:16:22,720
approached the inkscape people

03:16:20,319 --> 03:16:24,560
do you want to put inkscape on the

03:16:22,720 --> 03:16:26,000
microsoft store the windows store which

03:16:24,560 --> 03:16:28,800
was brand new back then

03:16:26,000 --> 03:16:30,080
and it was like okay how hard can it be

03:16:28,800 --> 03:16:32,479
they are offering

03:16:30,080 --> 03:16:33,680
the insane people to do all the work

03:16:32,479 --> 03:16:34,880
control the red tape

03:16:33,680 --> 03:16:37,279
set up the page set up all the

03:16:34,880 --> 03:16:38,880
credentials and figure out how to

03:16:37,279 --> 03:16:40,640
package the application

03:16:38,880 --> 03:16:43,120
and write me a little manual on how to

03:16:40,640 --> 03:16:44,080
do that i'm going to ask them whether

03:16:43,120 --> 03:16:46,239
they want to do that

03:16:44,080 --> 03:16:48,720
for us as well and by the end of the

03:16:46,239 --> 03:16:50,479
year kratos was in the windows store

03:16:48,720 --> 03:16:53,760
and i didn't have to do any consultancy

03:16:50,479 --> 03:16:55,600
work anymore because it paid for me

03:16:53,760 --> 03:16:57,120
that's why i think that if you're making

03:16:55,600 --> 03:16:58,239
free software available on the windows

03:16:57,120 --> 03:17:01,680
store you probably should

03:16:58,239 --> 03:17:01,680
consider asking money for it

03:17:02,319 --> 03:17:06,399
now again you're a sharecropper you're

03:17:04,560 --> 03:17:07,279
totally dependent on on the store

03:17:06,399 --> 03:17:09,200
policies

03:17:07,279 --> 03:17:10,800
we are not allowed to tell people on the

03:17:09,200 --> 03:17:12,239
store page that creator's free and open

03:17:10,800 --> 03:17:14,319
source software

03:17:12,239 --> 03:17:17,359
and we are allowed to link to our

03:17:14,319 --> 03:17:19,120
website but not to the download page

03:17:17,359 --> 03:17:20,399
because that's advertising an

03:17:19,120 --> 03:17:22,160
alternative

03:17:20,399 --> 03:17:24,000
way of installing twitter and of course

03:17:22,160 --> 03:17:25,200
this is the windows store everybody

03:17:24,000 --> 03:17:29,279
always claims that

03:17:25,200 --> 03:17:32,319
the windows store is a huge huge

03:17:29,279 --> 03:17:35,200
failure and not for us

03:17:32,319 --> 03:17:40,479
first it's been great windows stores

03:17:35,200 --> 03:17:43,680
team together now pay for eight people

03:17:40,479 --> 03:17:48,479
working with intel this is um

03:17:43,680 --> 03:17:50,560
oh so

03:17:48,479 --> 03:17:52,000
we had done those projects with intel s

03:17:50,560 --> 03:17:55,439
and chao gme8

03:17:52,000 --> 03:17:56,000
and after some time also 2017 and my our

03:17:55,439 --> 03:17:58,560
friends from

03:17:56,000 --> 03:18:00,239
intel uh approached us again and they

03:17:58,560 --> 03:18:03,359
had some interesting projects

03:18:00,239 --> 03:18:04,800
they wanted to sponsor like making krita

03:18:03,359 --> 03:18:07,279
work better with

03:18:04,800 --> 03:18:09,279
systems with huge numbers of course i

03:18:07,279 --> 03:18:10,960
was like yes but that's that's an amd

03:18:09,279 --> 03:18:14,560
thing these days isn't it

03:18:10,960 --> 03:18:15,520
intel doesn't have cpus within huge

03:18:14,560 --> 03:18:18,000
number of course

03:18:15,520 --> 03:18:20,560
and they said oh yes we have and send me

03:18:18,000 --> 03:18:23,200
a 10 core 20 thread

03:18:20,560 --> 03:18:24,000
theorem which is really fast and really

03:18:23,200 --> 03:18:25,600
nice

03:18:24,000 --> 03:18:27,439
so we did a couple of projects with them

03:18:25,600 --> 03:18:30,479
that were really interesting for us

03:18:27,439 --> 03:18:35,439
and really interesting for them um

03:18:30,479 --> 03:18:38,880
we optimized krita's brush engine a lot

03:18:35,439 --> 03:18:41,040
we created some tools in creator that

03:18:38,880 --> 03:18:42,880
were interesting for what they called

03:18:41,040 --> 03:18:43,760
convergent devices and devices with two

03:18:42,880 --> 03:18:45,439
screens

03:18:43,760 --> 03:18:47,520
but which basically meant that we now

03:18:45,439 --> 03:18:51,840
have session management and

03:18:47,520 --> 03:18:51,840
the window management

03:18:53,120 --> 03:18:57,760
and finally together with intel we

03:18:56,800 --> 03:19:00,640
created the first

03:18:57,760 --> 03:19:01,600
hdr capable image editor in the world we

03:19:00,640 --> 03:19:05,040
were the first

03:19:01,600 --> 03:19:07,439
and that was really really a success

03:19:05,040 --> 03:19:08,720
uh we usually get lost money on it

03:19:07,439 --> 03:19:11,439
though because

03:19:08,720 --> 03:19:12,640
we always spend more time on it and

03:19:11,439 --> 03:19:15,760
there's much yet

03:19:12,640 --> 03:19:16,800
and anyway because well this is until

03:19:15,760 --> 03:19:20,880
the

03:19:16,800 --> 03:19:23,200
is gone what i did learn

03:19:20,880 --> 03:19:25,600
at this point is only to do the projects

03:19:23,200 --> 03:19:28,080
that were already interesting for us

03:19:25,600 --> 03:19:30,080
a lot of free software projects that

03:19:28,080 --> 03:19:33,359
start to

03:19:30,080 --> 03:19:36,960
go commercial to film development end up

03:19:33,359 --> 03:19:40,000
doing contract work that's absolutely

03:19:36,960 --> 03:19:42,319
killing if you have your developers

03:19:40,000 --> 03:19:44,479
instead of working on your core project

03:19:42,319 --> 03:19:46,880
do projects for customers

03:19:44,479 --> 03:19:49,439
you're wasting your time it's you it's

03:19:46,880 --> 03:19:51,279
mostly useless so

03:19:49,439 --> 03:19:53,120
that's something that that i've foreign

03:19:51,279 --> 03:19:54,640
i would never do there are some some

03:19:53,120 --> 03:19:58,080
people i've discussed this with

03:19:54,640 --> 03:20:00,960
and if they are all against uh

03:19:58,080 --> 03:20:02,880
finding free software development then

03:20:00,960 --> 03:20:03,359
it's mostly their experience that all

03:20:02,880 --> 03:20:05,200
the good

03:20:03,359 --> 03:20:06,560
developers stopped working on the core

03:20:05,200 --> 03:20:07,920
project because they

03:20:06,560 --> 03:20:10,000
have to do projects to bring in the

03:20:07,920 --> 03:20:12,840
money to pay the salaries

03:20:10,000 --> 03:20:14,640
and the project slowly dies so don't do

03:20:12,840 --> 03:20:19,439
that

03:20:14,640 --> 03:20:21,600
2018 we did another fundraiser

03:20:19,439 --> 03:20:22,560
but we did this one on our own

03:20:21,600 --> 03:20:25,040
kickstarter

03:20:22,560 --> 03:20:27,279
really really isn't the place to be

03:20:25,040 --> 03:20:29,200
anymore

03:20:27,279 --> 03:20:31,439
we simplify the rewards you just got a

03:20:29,200 --> 03:20:34,160
nice download of the digital attribute

03:20:31,439 --> 03:20:36,880
a training pack and brush pack which i

03:20:34,160 --> 03:20:39,840
had commissioned ramon to make for us

03:20:36,880 --> 03:20:40,720
we made 27k which is less than the last

03:20:39,840 --> 03:20:43,359
kickstarter

03:20:40,720 --> 03:20:46,399
but we saved on rewards and fees and we

03:20:43,359 --> 03:20:49,680
didn't lose kickstarter's cut so

03:20:46,399 --> 03:20:50,560
more money in our bank account in this

03:20:49,680 --> 03:20:52,640
graph this is

03:20:50,560 --> 03:20:54,000
a graph money profiles molly is one of

03:20:52,640 --> 03:20:57,040
our payment providers

03:20:54,000 --> 03:21:00,000
we currently have stripe molly papal

03:20:57,040 --> 03:21:01,920
and braintree for various reasons um and

03:21:00,000 --> 03:21:05,600
that that's that's a pain to manage

03:21:01,920 --> 03:21:08,479
the big peak is the fundraiser of course

03:21:05,600 --> 03:21:10,399
and then you see how slowly slowly year

03:21:08,479 --> 03:21:12,720
over year

03:21:10,399 --> 03:21:14,880
the donations are increasing increasing

03:21:12,720 --> 03:21:15,920
but it's still not a lot we can pay one

03:21:14,880 --> 03:21:19,439
developer

03:21:15,920 --> 03:21:19,439
through these donations

03:21:19,520 --> 03:21:25,120
and these donations come from a donation

03:21:22,479 --> 03:21:26,720
page you get to after downloading krita

03:21:25,120 --> 03:21:28,560
some projects have the donation page

03:21:26,720 --> 03:21:30,640
before allowing you to download

03:21:28,560 --> 03:21:32,880
we don't like that we think that's too

03:21:30,640 --> 03:21:34,399
pushy so we ask people for donation

03:21:32,880 --> 03:21:38,239
after they download

03:21:34,399 --> 03:21:42,080
about 1 in 800 to 1000 downloads returns

03:21:38,239 --> 03:21:46,880
results in the donation we have

03:21:42,080 --> 03:21:46,880
about 400 000 downloads a month now

03:21:49,760 --> 03:21:57,600
so 2019 2020 2021

03:21:54,840 --> 03:21:58,960
2019 we had enough income from the

03:21:57,600 --> 03:22:00,399
windows store and steam and the

03:21:58,960 --> 03:22:02,800
donations

03:22:00,399 --> 03:22:04,640
that we didn't feel we needed to do a

03:22:02,800 --> 03:22:07,760
fundraiser we also felt

03:22:04,640 --> 03:22:09,760
we had sort of failed with the goal of

03:22:07,760 --> 03:22:10,960
the last fundraiser the last fundraiser

03:22:09,760 --> 03:22:14,319
we did had this goal

03:22:10,960 --> 03:22:17,760
no books zero books complete stability

03:22:14,319 --> 03:22:19,040
uh in 2019 we were at over 500 books

03:22:17,760 --> 03:22:21,600
which was

03:22:19,040 --> 03:22:22,640
awful i get nightmares about those big

03:22:21,600 --> 03:22:25,920
numbers

03:22:22,640 --> 03:22:29,279
but we could fund ourselves and we got

03:22:25,920 --> 03:22:32,160
more people working on krita

03:22:29,279 --> 03:22:32,880
we did put krita in the android app

03:22:32,160 --> 03:22:34,640
store and

03:22:32,880 --> 03:22:36,000
chrome os app store working together

03:22:34,640 --> 03:22:39,520
with google on that

03:22:36,000 --> 03:22:42,560
extra rules are if you ask money

03:22:39,520 --> 03:22:44,399
then no one can no let me start again if

03:22:42,560 --> 03:22:46,399
you install

03:22:44,399 --> 03:22:47,920
twitter on android or chromers you have

03:22:46,399 --> 03:22:49,040
to use the app store so we didn't want

03:22:47,920 --> 03:22:51,680
to ask for money

03:22:49,040 --> 03:22:52,239
so we put in a donation batch inside

03:22:51,680 --> 03:22:53,920
krita

03:22:52,239 --> 03:22:56,000
using google's payment thing because

03:22:53,920 --> 03:22:59,359
you're not allowed to use anything else

03:22:56,000 --> 03:23:02,880
because google is really greedy

03:22:59,359 --> 03:23:05,200
this brings in about 70 euros a month

03:23:02,880 --> 03:23:07,439
currently but it is still in beta we

03:23:05,200 --> 03:23:10,960
just don't have a good tablet gui

03:23:07,439 --> 03:23:12,960
we don't have a really good touch ui

03:23:10,960 --> 03:23:15,120
we are working on that we currently have

03:23:12,960 --> 03:23:17,840
one person working full time on krita

03:23:15,120 --> 03:23:19,439
for android and chrome os and he's

03:23:17,840 --> 03:23:21,040
making a lot of progress

03:23:19,439 --> 03:23:25,040
but there are so many bugs we need to

03:23:21,040 --> 03:23:28,000
fix so that situation is okay

03:23:25,040 --> 03:23:30,000
we added krita to the epic store two

03:23:28,000 --> 03:23:33,520
weeks ago yes two weeks ago

03:23:30,000 --> 03:23:34,640
um last year we already got an epic mega

03:23:33,520 --> 03:23:37,439
grand

03:23:34,640 --> 03:23:39,680
no that was still about 19 even longer

03:23:37,439 --> 03:23:42,000
ago

03:23:39,680 --> 03:23:43,439
quite a lot of money and i got good

03:23:42,000 --> 03:23:45,680
contact inside epic

03:23:43,439 --> 03:23:47,279
and he approached me we are going to put

03:23:45,680 --> 03:23:50,640
applications in the epic store

03:23:47,279 --> 03:23:50,960
are you really yes and we want to start

03:23:50,640 --> 03:23:53,200
with

03:23:50,960 --> 03:23:54,000
six applications we want to have krita

03:23:53,200 --> 03:23:57,359
as

03:23:54,000 --> 03:24:00,960
part of the first six can you make it

03:23:57,359 --> 03:24:03,040
i can try um

03:24:00,960 --> 03:24:04,399
it's too early to see what epic the epic

03:24:03,040 --> 03:24:08,160
store is bringing in

03:24:04,399 --> 03:24:10,080
i see about 30 sales a day

03:24:08,160 --> 03:24:13,040
and it's the same deal as in all the

03:24:10,080 --> 03:24:14,800
other app stores you pay you get updates

03:24:13,040 --> 03:24:16,610
but you get the same binary as if you

03:24:14,800 --> 03:24:19,799
would download from creator.org

03:24:16,610 --> 03:24:19,799
[Music]

03:24:21,840 --> 03:24:25,359
that's it for now ios store and the

03:24:24,880 --> 03:24:29,120
apple

03:24:25,359 --> 03:24:31,279
store are for now out because

03:24:29,120 --> 03:24:32,399
ios is difficult lesson twice krita's

03:24:31,279 --> 03:24:34,479
tpl v3

03:24:32,399 --> 03:24:35,920
and we're not going to change that i am

03:24:34,479 --> 03:24:41,040
a firm believer in

03:24:35,920 --> 03:24:42,960
software freedom on mac os

03:24:41,040 --> 03:24:44,080
we have some problems with apple

03:24:42,960 --> 03:24:47,279
deprecating

03:24:44,080 --> 03:24:48,080
open apis like opengl and replacing them

03:24:47,279 --> 03:24:50,560
with horrible

03:24:48,080 --> 03:24:51,520
proprietary apis that i just don't want

03:24:50,560 --> 03:24:54,960
to support

03:24:51,520 --> 03:24:58,479
and the layers between metal and

03:24:54,960 --> 03:25:01,600
open gl translation layers like angle

03:24:58,479 --> 03:25:01,600
are just not there yet

03:25:02,399 --> 03:25:10,479
so what did we do last week well

03:25:05,600 --> 03:25:14,160
we launched a defense another clear

03:25:10,479 --> 03:25:17,279
clone from what blended us this time

03:25:14,160 --> 03:25:18,120
we even cloned their code base we just

03:25:17,279 --> 03:25:21,359
took

03:25:18,120 --> 03:25:25,120
defend.blender.org a git repository

03:25:21,359 --> 03:25:27,760
cloned it and started changing it so

03:25:25,120 --> 03:25:29,200
it would be films.twitter.org carl swan

03:25:27,760 --> 03:25:32,080
did most of the work for that

03:25:29,200 --> 03:25:34,319
and i'm really grateful to him it does

03:25:32,080 --> 03:25:36,160
work seems to work we already have about

03:25:34,319 --> 03:25:38,640
100 new subscribers

03:25:36,160 --> 03:25:40,720
we don't have a corporate subscriber yet

03:25:38,640 --> 03:25:43,200
and that's actually quite interesting

03:25:40,720 --> 03:25:43,760
not having corporate subscribers it's a

03:25:43,200 --> 03:25:47,279
bit

03:25:43,760 --> 03:25:49,200
the same as ital was talking about

03:25:47,279 --> 03:25:51,600
over the years we have been reaching out

03:25:49,200 --> 03:25:54,640
to vfx studios and game studios

03:25:51,600 --> 03:25:58,080
we know they are using krita

03:25:54,640 --> 03:25:59,680
um because they are telling us so

03:25:58,080 --> 03:26:01,680
we've been at siggraph and they thought

03:25:59,680 --> 03:26:03,279
oh will you tweet yes use greeter for

03:26:01,680 --> 03:26:05,439
this movie oh too wonderful too

03:26:03,279 --> 03:26:07,840
if you can only add this feature then it

03:26:05,439 --> 03:26:09,760
would be even greater and then maybe we

03:26:07,840 --> 03:26:12,000
would give you some money this never

03:26:09,760 --> 03:26:13,120
happened at one point we had a

03:26:12,000 --> 03:26:15,279
centerless

03:26:13,120 --> 03:26:17,040
repository because all these studios

03:26:15,279 --> 03:26:19,920
used to use centos

03:26:17,040 --> 03:26:21,120
really old versions of centers um then

03:26:19,920 --> 03:26:24,160
they

03:26:21,120 --> 03:26:24,560
would ask for test access and then they

03:26:24,160 --> 03:26:26,319
would

03:26:24,560 --> 03:26:28,239
test this for a year and then we would

03:26:26,319 --> 03:26:29,279
ask them and now are you going to pony

03:26:28,239 --> 03:26:31,359
up for a subscription

03:26:29,279 --> 03:26:33,040
i would say sorry but we really can't

03:26:31,359 --> 03:26:34,720
afford it

03:26:33,040 --> 03:26:37,040
life is so hard in the field fix

03:26:34,720 --> 03:26:39,120
industry

03:26:37,040 --> 03:26:40,640
so i'm kind of wondering what's going to

03:26:39,120 --> 03:26:43,359
happen here

03:26:40,640 --> 03:26:45,600
and the people i know from the studios

03:26:43,359 --> 03:26:48,160
are all great people

03:26:45,600 --> 03:26:48,880
i would like some more money please but

03:26:48,160 --> 03:26:51,600
we'll see

03:26:48,880 --> 03:26:52,720
whether corporate support is going to

03:26:51,600 --> 03:26:56,239
happen

03:26:52,720 --> 03:26:56,960
it it helps that both adobe and autodesk

03:26:56,239 --> 03:27:00,080
are

03:26:56,960 --> 03:27:03,439
at the moment really busy messing up

03:27:00,080 --> 03:27:03,439
with their their user base

03:27:04,640 --> 03:27:07,840
but let's see what's going to happen

03:27:05,920 --> 03:27:08,520
with thunder treatment.org this month is

03:27:07,840 --> 03:27:10,640
officially

03:27:08,520 --> 03:27:12,479
find.twinter.org campaign move i'm

03:27:10,640 --> 03:27:14,800
always going to do a weekly video for a

03:27:12,479 --> 03:27:17,279
cool new feature from twitter5

03:27:14,800 --> 03:27:20,080
and let's see let's see let's see it's

03:27:17,279 --> 03:27:20,080
quite exciting

03:27:20,399 --> 03:27:27,120
so what did i learned over the years

03:27:24,479 --> 03:27:28,880
i'm summarizing his ads asking nicely

03:27:27,120 --> 03:27:32,399
doesn't work

03:27:28,880 --> 03:27:34,160
you cannot find a project like twitter

03:27:32,399 --> 03:27:37,040
just for a donation page people see

03:27:34,160 --> 03:27:39,840
after downloading it

03:27:37,040 --> 03:27:41,359
we have about 3 million concurrent users

03:27:39,840 --> 03:27:42,239
or windows we know that because

03:27:41,359 --> 03:27:45,600
microsoft tracks

03:27:42,239 --> 03:27:45,600
every x you execute

03:27:50,800 --> 03:27:58,479
we had about 4 000 donations for about

03:27:54,960 --> 03:28:01,840
45000 euros that's just the donations

03:27:58,479 --> 03:28:03,200
now if you would go to a limits only

03:28:01,840 --> 03:28:05,359
situation it would be

03:28:03,200 --> 03:28:06,399
way worse because those three million

03:28:05,359 --> 03:28:09,279
users we have

03:28:06,399 --> 03:28:10,319
are all winners users and linux macos

03:28:09,279 --> 03:28:13,920
users

03:28:10,319 --> 03:28:16,880
get lost in in in in

03:28:13,920 --> 03:28:18,560
running errors the situation for treat

03:28:16,880 --> 03:28:21,120
is a bit different than it is for some

03:28:18,560 --> 03:28:23,279
other applications because

03:28:21,120 --> 03:28:24,960
we have to patch qt so badly we have

03:28:23,279 --> 03:28:28,479
about 70 to 80 patches

03:28:24,960 --> 03:28:31,439
to queue that we can't get up streamed

03:28:28,479 --> 03:28:32,720
that most linux users use our app image

03:28:31,439 --> 03:28:36,399
built which you download from our

03:28:32,720 --> 03:28:38,560
website so we got those numbers

03:28:36,399 --> 03:28:40,479
we also got numbers for linux on steam

03:28:38,560 --> 03:28:43,680
because on steam you can release

03:28:40,479 --> 03:28:47,200
linux software we have 30 000

03:28:43,680 --> 03:28:51,520
windows sales on steam and 274

03:28:47,200 --> 03:28:53,439
linux sales on steam so

03:28:51,520 --> 03:28:55,680
this is one of the problems i see there

03:28:53,439 --> 03:28:55,680
where

03:28:56,160 --> 03:29:02,880
the linux community is is is

03:28:59,680 --> 03:29:06,560
too small to actually support a project

03:29:02,880 --> 03:29:10,960
that needs seven to nine developers

03:29:06,560 --> 03:29:10,960
so let's have some unpopular ideas

03:29:13,760 --> 03:29:17,439
if we want to have chance to get money

03:29:15,760 --> 03:29:19,439
at all from linux users

03:29:17,439 --> 03:29:21,359
we need to be able to interact with

03:29:19,439 --> 03:29:22,880
those users directly

03:29:21,359 --> 03:29:25,680
and that doesn't happen if people

03:29:22,880 --> 03:29:27,600
install a transformation package

03:29:25,680 --> 03:29:29,120
that's quite apart from the fact that

03:29:27,600 --> 03:29:30,000
the distribution package probably won't

03:29:29,120 --> 03:29:31,760
work as well

03:29:30,000 --> 03:29:33,760
as our app image because of all those

03:29:31,760 --> 03:29:36,720
cute packet patches

03:29:33,760 --> 03:29:38,560
so should distribution stop packaging

03:29:36,720 --> 03:29:40,960
big applications altogether

03:29:38,560 --> 03:29:42,960
i mean no blender user no serious

03:29:40,960 --> 03:29:43,920
blender user is using blender from a

03:29:42,960 --> 03:29:45,760
repository

03:29:43,920 --> 03:29:48,880
they all get blended from blender.org

03:29:45,760 --> 03:29:52,640
because it needs to be fresh

03:29:48,880 --> 03:29:54,160
um that brings me down to flat up

03:29:52,640 --> 03:29:55,840
grita isn't flattered and it's being

03:29:54,160 --> 03:29:57,840
maintained by

03:29:55,840 --> 03:30:00,000
some really excellent people who also

03:29:57,840 --> 03:30:02,000
help out getting us fixes

03:30:00,000 --> 03:30:04,160
there is even a link to our website on

03:30:02,000 --> 03:30:07,040
flatup but is there

03:30:04,160 --> 03:30:09,359
any way to actually ask people on

03:30:07,040 --> 03:30:12,479
flutter directly to give me money

03:30:09,359 --> 03:30:14,560
i don't think so um because it's another

03:30:12,479 --> 03:30:16,160
place where we don't control the

03:30:14,560 --> 03:30:18,960
distribution of krita that

03:30:16,160 --> 03:30:21,760
makes it really difficult then if we

03:30:18,960 --> 03:30:26,080
want to reach out to our linux users

03:30:21,760 --> 03:30:27,840
in-app purchases in-app donation buttons

03:30:26,080 --> 03:30:29,439
would those get stripped out i don't

03:30:27,840 --> 03:30:32,080
know

03:30:29,439 --> 03:30:32,640
i would be curious to learn about that

03:30:32,080 --> 03:30:34,080
but

03:30:32,640 --> 03:30:35,920
that's that's really the big big

03:30:34,080 --> 03:30:40,560
challenge i see right now

03:30:35,920 --> 03:30:45,520
for krita or linux not enough people

03:30:40,560 --> 03:30:47,920
and not enough contact with those people

03:30:45,520 --> 03:30:50,880
so what should we do about that that's a

03:30:47,920 --> 03:30:52,479
discussion i would really like to have

03:30:50,880 --> 03:30:59,840
i see i still have some time for

03:30:52,479 --> 03:30:59,840
questions what are questions

03:31:03,410 --> 03:31:06,540
[Music]

03:31:11,359 --> 03:31:14,720
uh there are some questions actually in

03:31:13,600 --> 03:31:17,920
the shared

03:31:14,720 --> 03:31:19,200
notes i will show you them there should

03:31:17,920 --> 03:31:21,680
be an icon

03:31:19,200 --> 03:31:22,479
i'm seeing them i'm seeing them yeah got

03:31:21,680 --> 03:31:24,720
it

03:31:22,479 --> 03:31:25,760
jennifer asked me does it help to be

03:31:24,720 --> 03:31:27,040
part of kde

03:31:25,760 --> 03:31:29,040
and that's a really good question

03:31:27,040 --> 03:31:32,239
because i've been asking that question

03:31:29,040 --> 03:31:34,479
myself quite a few times

03:31:32,239 --> 03:31:36,319
because it cuts both ways is it good for

03:31:34,479 --> 03:31:38,080
kde that creature is part of it

03:31:36,319 --> 03:31:40,640
and is good for treated to be part of

03:31:38,080 --> 03:31:42,319
kde in the past couple of years i've

03:31:40,640 --> 03:31:45,840
come to the conclusion that it's an

03:31:42,319 --> 03:31:48,560
excellent thing it's really wonderful

03:31:45,840 --> 03:31:50,000
and not just because kde kids gives us a

03:31:48,560 --> 03:31:53,200
great infrastructure

03:31:50,000 --> 03:31:57,359
for things like translations the gitlab

03:31:53,200 --> 03:32:01,120
luxella mailing lists and

03:31:57,359 --> 03:32:04,960
it brings also new contributors

03:32:01,120 --> 03:32:06,960
um in general just give them good feels

03:32:04,960 --> 03:32:08,800
i'm happy to be part of kde it's

03:32:06,960 --> 03:32:10,720
something that we used to have to

03:32:08,800 --> 03:32:13,760
explain to users quite a lot

03:32:10,720 --> 03:32:15,840
a couple of years ago but apparently the

03:32:13,760 --> 03:32:17,760
kde rebranding as a collection of

03:32:15,840 --> 03:32:19,680
projects instead of just a desktop

03:32:17,760 --> 03:32:21,279
has worked because i haven't had that

03:32:19,680 --> 03:32:24,399
question for years

03:32:21,279 --> 03:32:26,880
anymore so yeah good

03:32:24,399 --> 03:32:28,000
good to be part of kde are you

03:32:26,880 --> 03:32:30,319
considering adding a

03:32:28,000 --> 03:32:32,000
premium license for companies making big

03:32:30,319 --> 03:32:35,600
revenues

03:32:32,000 --> 03:32:39,040
no it's

03:32:35,600 --> 03:32:40,479
krita's gpl v3 um we have got about a

03:32:39,040 --> 03:32:41,920
thousand copyright holders we are not

03:32:40,479 --> 03:32:44,000
going to re-license

03:32:41,920 --> 03:32:45,600
and even so i would much prefer those

03:32:44,000 --> 03:32:46,640
big companies to become corporate

03:32:45,600 --> 03:32:49,200
sponsors

03:32:46,640 --> 03:32:50,000
and meet with us twice a year so they

03:32:49,200 --> 03:32:52,960
can discuss their

03:32:50,000 --> 03:32:54,560
needs we can prioritize them or not

03:32:52,960 --> 03:32:55,279
depending on whether we agree with those

03:32:54,560 --> 03:32:57,680
needs

03:32:55,279 --> 03:32:59,359
so let them become corporate sponsors

03:32:57,680 --> 03:33:01,200
i'm not going to make special licenses

03:32:59,359 --> 03:33:04,239
for them

03:33:01,200 --> 03:33:08,239
why app image admin which is wonderful

03:33:04,239 --> 03:33:12,080
but really it is it's easy to make

03:33:08,239 --> 03:33:13,920
it's really easy to use people just just

03:33:12,080 --> 03:33:15,680
have to make it executable people can

03:33:13,920 --> 03:33:16,560
have six seven or hundred different

03:33:15,680 --> 03:33:19,359
versions

03:33:16,560 --> 03:33:20,720
around all the time and compare them the

03:33:19,359 --> 03:33:23,920
app image people were

03:33:20,720 --> 03:33:23,920
wonderful to work with

03:33:24,239 --> 03:33:28,800
i just like app image and tweet is also

03:33:26,960 --> 03:33:31,680
in snapstarts also done by a volunteer

03:33:28,800 --> 03:33:34,880
just like like the flatback

03:33:31,680 --> 03:33:37,760
i have a feeling that flatback

03:33:34,880 --> 03:33:41,040
with its portal system has given us a

03:33:37,760 --> 03:33:41,040
lot of bugs over the years

03:33:42,080 --> 03:33:45,760
so i'm not not not too eager about

03:33:45,040 --> 03:33:49,200
flatback

03:33:45,760 --> 03:33:50,560
i like app image it works great

03:33:49,200 --> 03:33:52,479
have you considered offering

03:33:50,560 --> 03:33:54,160
subscriptions to xs binaries

03:33:52,479 --> 03:33:55,920
yes yes well that's what i was telling

03:33:54,160 --> 03:33:57,520
about that is something we did in the

03:33:55,920 --> 03:33:59,600
kojnbh days

03:33:57,520 --> 03:34:00,800
we had this sentence repository for

03:33:59,600 --> 03:34:04,000
companies

03:34:00,800 --> 03:34:05,680
and when i said we had no one taking up

03:34:04,000 --> 03:34:07,600
the subscription that was a lie

03:34:05,680 --> 03:34:10,399
we had one company taking out a

03:34:07,600 --> 03:34:13,040
subscription for 75 euros a year

03:34:10,399 --> 03:34:14,720
so that was not worth it and i'm not

03:34:13,040 --> 03:34:16,560
going to do that again

03:34:14,720 --> 03:34:18,479
i know that creator is used a lot by

03:34:16,560 --> 03:34:19,680
professionals also in professional

03:34:18,479 --> 03:34:21,760
studios

03:34:19,680 --> 03:34:23,760
but pretty much all the money we get are

03:34:21,760 --> 03:34:25,680
from individual users

03:34:23,760 --> 03:34:27,600
and if those are the people who support

03:34:25,680 --> 03:34:28,000
me those are the people i will support

03:34:27,600 --> 03:34:31,600
the

03:34:28,000 --> 03:34:33,600
most some time ago there were plans to

03:34:31,600 --> 03:34:35,200
add payments in flat up maybe a good

03:34:33,600 --> 03:34:36,960
idea to

03:34:35,200 --> 03:34:38,239
contact them to know the status of that

03:34:36,960 --> 03:34:42,080
effort

03:34:38,239 --> 03:34:43,600
will do thanks for the tip

03:34:42,080 --> 03:34:45,359
creator team tried to make deals with

03:34:43,600 --> 03:34:47,359
governments to have free to replace its

03:34:45,359 --> 03:34:50,000
proprietary counterparts

03:34:47,359 --> 03:34:50,000
in schools

03:34:51,600 --> 03:34:55,359
i haven't thought of that but i do know

03:34:54,319 --> 03:34:58,239
that i actually

03:34:55,359 --> 03:35:01,439
went to talk about krita in several art

03:34:58,239 --> 03:35:03,200
universities in the netherlands

03:35:01,439 --> 03:35:04,479
the first one in ridda people were

03:35:03,200 --> 03:35:07,120
really interesting

03:35:04,479 --> 03:35:07,920
and they they hung on my lips and they

03:35:07,120 --> 03:35:09,760
were all like

03:35:07,920 --> 03:35:11,200
oh wonderful and at the end of my

03:35:09,760 --> 03:35:13,439
presentation they asked me so

03:35:11,200 --> 03:35:15,040
so how much does this per month it's

03:35:13,439 --> 03:35:17,040

03:35:27,680 --> 03:35:31,760
art university

03:35:28,720 --> 03:35:32,720

03:35:31,760 --> 03:35:35,920
tilburg

03:35:32,720 --> 03:35:38,640

03:35:35,920 --> 03:35:40,319
examination time and all the students i

03:35:38,640 --> 03:35:43,120

were busy doing animation in krita they

03:35:43,120 --> 03:35:46,800
already knew all about it

03:35:44,319 --> 03:35:47,600
but to use these sticks and schwark was

03:35:46,800 --> 03:35:50,160

03:35:47,600 --> 03:35:51,279

03:35:50,160 --> 03:35:54,160
trained to become

03:35:51,279 --> 03:35:54,560
comic book artists that was a bit boring

03:35:54,160 --> 03:35:57,920
the

03:35:54,560 --> 03:35:59,840
people were they they had to listen as

03:35:57,920 --> 03:36:02,000
part of their curriculum and

03:35:59,840 --> 03:36:03,520
that didn't work as well but twitter is

03:36:02,000 --> 03:36:07,040
