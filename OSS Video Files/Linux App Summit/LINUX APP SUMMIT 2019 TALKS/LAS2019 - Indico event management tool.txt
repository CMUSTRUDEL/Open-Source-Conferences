less public so I have a lot of

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:15,270
experience in many moments I try it too

00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:17,610
Knight Rider I really needed I wanted to

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:21,810
explain a little bit some of the other

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:24,119
complications of manager of a managing a

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:29,009
good conference one of them for sample

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:32,610
is the process of the the coral cover

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:35,070
papers procedure on how to do the

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:38,850
process and how to publish the reversals

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:41,880
how to publish the slides or or article

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:45,600
related to keep the website that way to

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:48,119
create a man change the shovel and the

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,299
other part is the the registration and

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:54,149
keeping the read the data registration

00:01:50,299 --> 00:02:01,350
by each participant on the way on their

00:01:54,149 --> 00:02:03,299
own if you need to to to house it to pay

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,350
for something because you want to sell

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,799
merchandising

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:11,140
you need to cause some some specific

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,600
attend or whatever you need

00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,970
a penguin bridge so there are a lot of

00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,430
features that there are many

00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:21,160
alternatives supposes that alternatives

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,140
are out there in in the pencil war

00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,870
because it's I'm not the only one

00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:28,630
I focused I'm very grateful today to the

00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:31,420
people who created teach a maintainer

00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:34,690
but in my experience they are swapped

00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:38,740
among the good thing about the Indigo

00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:42,430
and I don't really test it fully in a

00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:46,300
real event so I'm talking in a in a

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,810
catatonic author of faith so please

00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,090
believe me

00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:53,410
I sure because I have been illuminated

00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:56,200
by the the see I see erm you know the

00:02:53,410 --> 00:03:00,540
the place where they will was invented

00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:04,900
they have managed about five hundred

00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:08,380
thousands of event with this tool so to

00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:12,610
me this is a lot of warranties about

00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:17,080
water made sure to can be it has a lot

00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:20,190
of features and I want to call to

00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:23,320
anybody related in some way or another

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:27,070
involved in organizing it's particularly

00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:30,850
a conferences in the best world to reach

00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:33,910
me and to try we have an instance of

00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:37,780
indigo to to play with I would love to

00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:41,230
see Academy moving to to to indigo I

00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:45,310
want to see the last bow into indigo I

00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:47,680
have some hopes to forget on to moto to

00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:51,100
indigo I'm pushing this thing in

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,230
Wikimedia to I want to do with almost

00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:55,660
any community I am more or less that

00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,430
related or hi I have been related I want

00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:01,030
to move this because I really know how

00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:03,370
hard they this war is probably the most

00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:05,590
of you can say this is not very

00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,260
interesting to me but you use this as a

00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:11,350
side end user and you deserve the best

00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,860
experience possible as possible and this

00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:16,630
tool is very pretty active in

00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:21,340
development is well funded and backed by

00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:22,380
the CERN is brightening in Python it has

00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,290
plugins is

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:31,170
extensible and have api's for whatever

00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:33,480
so is the obvious alternative and and

00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:37,790
nothing but to say that

00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,790
