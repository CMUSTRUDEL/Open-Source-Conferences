[Applause]

00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,950
thank you

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:11,130
can you hear me by the way yeah seems to

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,590
work alright well thanks everyone for

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,170
making it after lunch

00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:21,390
what okay it's all your working okay

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:23,369
very nice so yeah so I'm to be as I work

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,400
on the Graham design team and this is

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:29,039
Jordan he's under release team and over

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,230
the past few years we've kind of like

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,030
worked on every part of the gum stack

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,520
whether that's like third-party apps or

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:39,390
core apps core system stuff and

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,710
everywhere in between and I think like

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,780
this talk is maybe a little bit of like

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,070
a high level of reflection of some of

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,579
the things we've learned through that

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,860
time and maybe that the wider community

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,920
has has learned over the past few

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:58,350
decades of trying to make this a free

00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:02,219
software consumer software thing of

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,019
trying to get that to work and the

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,159
reason why we wanted to give this talk

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,500
and how this whole thing kind of came

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,150
about was we were aquatic this year and

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:16,140
we were talking about this conference

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:18,600
and how sort of they're there there's a

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,420
lot of assumptions in things like the

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,400
Linux app ecosystem because we kind of

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,750
see ourselves as like you know there's

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,759
like Windows and then there's the Mac

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,159
and we want to be like this third player

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:32,280
right well like weird the other way like

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,920
you built for this one too and I think

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,400
the piece that often we're missing right

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,390
like you you think of when you listen do

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,430
you think of like oh we're gonna have

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,070
all these apps and like everyone's gonna

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,049
build for our amazing platform and you

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,630
really sort of like think of this sort

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:51,420
of superficial layer of the thing you

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,280
want but what often kind of gets left

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,899
out is the reason why that works in some

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,570
places and why it may be it doesn't as

00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:01,350
well in our area and that's the layer

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,939
below that which is the platform and I

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,850
think we kind of throw that word around

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:09,539
a lot just like sort of not super not

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:11,400
defining it super well and I think that

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,890
that might be part of the reason for

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,050
some of the misunderstandings issues

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,840
we've been having so maybe a good

00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,709
starting point is like looking at a more

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,910
detailed definition of that and sort of

00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:29,100
maybe what some other platforms are

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:30,720
doing right just seeing like what what

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,100
what does it take to sort of have a

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,480
fully functional platform and what are

00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,720
all the various pieces did you need for

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,850
that and there are a few audiences that

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,160
you kinda need to make happy for that

00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:43,350
there's the developers that obviously

00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,360
make the apps there's the designers who

00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,680
design them which is the part that we're

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,400
often missing I feel like increase

00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,480
offering is is very very important part

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,000
if you actually want like a very

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,580
desirable set of like good third-party

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,880
apps renowned as a Rodian of course the

00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,950
end users on the developer side it's

00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,720
like relatively straightforward what you

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,910
need right developers need an operating

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,440
system to develop on that needs to be

00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,750
integrated with the actual technology

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,190
and like you need good developer tooling

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,260
that runs on that and that's like well

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,989
integrate it with the documentation and

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,940
you need sort of examples and guides and

00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:20,579
all of that to help people get started

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,410
and then you need an app store kind of

00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:24,510
submission story like right you've made

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:27,959
your app now how do you get it to people

00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:31,019
right like submission review all of that

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,120
stuff like an actual app store and then

00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:34,230
for designers the requirements are kind

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,900
of similar but there's some extra

00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:39,959
software the OS doesn't matter as much

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,510
as probably the tooling because for

00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,920
designers to actually like make stuff on

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,180
that platform you really need good

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,510
tooling for them so that you can like

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,890
make mock-ups and prototypes and sort of

00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,390
get to a point where where before

00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,360
implementation starts they've already

00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,920
thought through all the important things

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,680
you need a visual language and like

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,010
design patterns right is your platform

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,100
like all wood and I don't know like

00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:07,320
textures and and the metal or is it

00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,670
super simple typography and like plain

00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,329
colors I mean this is like the extreme

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:13,859
examples but that kind of thing right

00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:16,590
like develop developers and designers

00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:18,810
need to be need to sort of be clear on

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,130
what they're actually building for and

00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,989
then there's like patterns are just

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,840
navigation like how do you do menus and

00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:27,540
all these things like and you need

00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,090
guidelines that define all of that and

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,490
so give the designers a good idea for

00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:35,040
for what's needed there and then on the

00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,600
end user side similarly you need an OS

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,280
which doesn't necessarily need to be the

00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,200
same as the OS that the developers are

00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,240
using right like mobile does fine with

00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,250
two separate dresses but I guess ideally

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,010
it would be the same just because it's

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:49,920
simpler you need an app store obviously

00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:53,730
that people can download the apps that

00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,980
developers made from and you need a

00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:57,300
support story of some kind ideally you

00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,640
would have stores that people can go to

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,230
to get help but probably that's not

00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,550
feasible in most cases it would already

00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,610
be something though to have like a good

00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:07,800
Stack Overflow page or some some kind of

00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,110
like story there for you to support and

00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,990
all of these different things that's

00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:15,330
that's a lot of stuff right make up a

00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,500
platform and when we throw the word

00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:20,760
around we often mean like one or two

00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:22,740
somewhere in in this in this whole chart

00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:26,640
well like you really need all of it for

00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:28,950
it to actually work and we can sort of

00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,170
maybe simplify all of those down into

00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,520
these four categories to keep track of

00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,950
it a little easier there's like you have

00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,510
a guy who have an operating system you

00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,730
have to have the developer tooling as

00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:41,580
the cave side of it you need to have an

00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:43,530
actual sort of design set of design

00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,760
guidance and a platform from that point

00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:50,670
of view like what does everything look

00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:55,680
like and you need an app store story so

00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:57,480
this brings our our environment and how

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,280
does it look in this in our freezer

00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:03,810
communities we have Linux wits everybody

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,750
throws around us the bass work oh I

00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:11,430
built for Linux but what is Linux really

00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:13,260
it's just a Carol nothing of these many

00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,090
people buy Linux they mean the Linux

00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:19,200
desktop which is most of the time some

00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:21,120
free desktop compliant environment but

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,440
the desk of itself also isn't any of

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,090
this it's not an operating system it's

00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:28,290
like so it's mostly place there were

00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,750
different desktop implementations can

00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:32,520
share common infrastructure and avoid

00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:35,610
duplication and make have things work

00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:38,550
across governments then we can look at

00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:41,400
this rush a modest go-to example here

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:43,710
because they have

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,440
operating systems have an app store did

00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:48,840
not have developer SDK or design

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,910
language they were almost they almost

00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:54,210
had that with TNT aid they were almost a

00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:56,220
platform with their own set of features

00:06:54,210 --> 00:07:00,600
that wouldn't end tails default of

00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:03,270
visual language toolkit but they treats

00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:08,550
the norm she recently and drop indeed so

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:11,400
they're kinda like not yeah we move to

00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:13,590
be numb numb has a pretty good developer

00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,960
tooling and design language it kind of

00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:18,270
has a Napster with blog hub Rob talked

00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,340
about the width Adler but it's still not

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,690
an operating system there is like

00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,190
multiple distributions of nom and

00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,460
everybody packets it differently in a

00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:27,530
different configuration so who else is

00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,419
harder

00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,930
we have elementary with somehow

00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:35,280
curiously enough the excel the boxes

00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,260
they have an operating system it's based

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,830
on a bundle but they go the extra mile

00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:42,449
have pretty good developer tooling the

00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:45,750
really nice design language and their

00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:47,550
own app store and this brings us to some

00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:50,099
like this which is a really nice

00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:52,440
application ecosystem that people start

00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:55,800
have started targeting elementary as the

00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:59,639
main platform and write all kinds of new

00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:06,360
apps just for elementary but why are the

00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:09,210
only ones right and that that's a good

00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,889
question and the I think to sort of like

00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:13,889
look for an answer we need to go maybe

00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:17,520
all the way back like the very beginning

00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:19,740
the 90s when free software is just sort

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,690
of starting out and you had all these

00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,190
different disconnected projects kind of

00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:25,229
like making one of them is making a

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,909
panel on the owners making a clock and

00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:28,590
the other one is making like I don't

00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:30,810
know a file manager and they're all like

00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:33,630
these completely disconnected project

00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:36,120
and the distributions started initially

00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:37,709
as like this thing that takes all these

00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,680
disparate pieces and actually makes a

00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:42,810
product out of them right

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,459
but as desktops developed like this is

00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,050
chrome one here like over the genome to

00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:48,120
cycle like design kind of entered the

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:50,070
pictures and people like start carrying

00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,540
about consistency and like making sure

00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:54,850
the whole thing actually is integrated

00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,319
better and then as they move further

00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:58,180
in that direction we eventually got to

00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:00,040
the point where people realize that the

00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:03,220
whole experience should kind of be

00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,079
designed as as one piece and with genome

00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,360
3 were actually like pretty close to

00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:09,100
that right like we have a single shell

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,839
now that actually serves as well

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,690
integrated instead of like 15 random

00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:15,610
pieces that don't quite fit we have a

00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,829
set of core apps we have all sorts of

00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:20,440
underlying technologies that enable all

00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:22,300
of these experiences and we're now at a

00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,040
point where desktops are really sort of

00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,019
moving towards being platforms right

00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,790
like we saw with chrome before like

00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:31,470
there's not that much missing on the

00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:33,940
chart and we we're now at the point that

00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:36,519
despite sort of not everything being in

00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:39,279
place at least on the ground side which

00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:40,630
is what I know like we're actually

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,579
getting to the point where we sort of

00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,660
have a nice developer platform in some

00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:46,779
ways like there's a lot of cool

00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:49,060
third-party apps kind of that have come

00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:51,040
up in the last few years and we're

00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,199
really moving in that direction but that

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,410
operating system side is still missing

00:09:53,199 --> 00:10:00,009
so at the end of the day like we still

00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:03,339
we're still in that 90s kind of paradigm

00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:06,610
of like the distributions are the final

00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:09,579
sort of step on the way to like people

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:11,889
getting the software and that's a bit of

00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:14,019
a weird mismatch right like you have the

00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:16,089
desktops making a thing that used to be

00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:17,350
a bunch of random components but now

00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:20,230
it's the century were just like one

00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:23,470
component that is actually a product all

00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:25,209
on its own that then goes through the

00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,550
distribution repositories in order to

00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:29,259
get to the users and that was fine like

00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:31,000
when it was a whole bunch of stuff being

00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:32,259
integrated but not as not really that

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,720
much integration happening anymore

00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:37,930
because it's already happening at the

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,470
desktop level right and that's kind of

00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:43,389
awkward and there's all sorts of like

00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:46,720
weird frictions happening there because

00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:48,939
of that and the other interesting thing

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,550
about this is that it puts desktop

00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:53,649
developers in a similar situation that

00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,959
app developers have been in for a very

00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:58,000
long time because app developers have

00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:59,949
always made products right an app is

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,250
like a self-contained thing that works

00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:05,769
all on its own and app developers care

00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,930
about the whole thing and now desktops

00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:08,740
and app developers are essentially in

00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:13,750
that same

00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:15,910
in that same paradigm right and they

00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,770
have the same gripes right there's the

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:20,740
release schedule which both app and us

00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:22,720
of developers hate because like your

00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:27,310
release version something of your app

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:29,260
now next week some the week after that

00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,750
like they release and then it can be

00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,880
frozen until who knows when and then any

00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,920
bug fixes you make I don't know for next

00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,900
year or whenever the next version comes

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,860
out are not gonna reach your users which

00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:44,890
is great and the same goes for desktops

00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:47,830
there's packaging issues where the

00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:49,330
reality is that in distributions most of

00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,220
the packages have like 50 different

00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:52,810
packages that they're taking care of and

00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,820
they don't know the software as well as

00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,230
the actual developer and so you get all

00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:59,320
sorts of weird misunderstandings and

00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,850
issues from that there's overriding just

00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,770
straight-up the upstream decision where

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,270
like upstream changes something and then

00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:06,160
some distribution is like well actually

00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,690
we wanted to the old way or we wanted a

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,290
different way or we have this problem

00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:12,670
that we want solve and obviously like if

00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:15,390
you're a person making a product you

00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:17,860
want that product to get to people right

00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:19,090
you don't want someone else making some

00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,820
random decision in between without

00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:23,860
talking me and then there's all the

00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:28,930
issues around theming branding where I

00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:31,510
mean just just generally like the the

00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:34,660
same issue has the one we had before but

00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:36,490
like for visuals where if you apply

00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:39,610
random CSS to every app it's gonna

00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:42,250
breaks up and I think that just leads to

00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:44,920
sort of this general situation where if

00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,690
you're a distribution there's kind of

00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,800
like it's kind of a no-win situation

00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:52,570
because the incentives for you are you

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,490
are the person sort of like closest to

00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,990
the actual people using the software so

00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,870
you like I see this problem I want to

00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:01,570
solve it so you solve it downstream but

00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,610
then like you end up like endless where

00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:05,890
they have million downstream patches and

00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,360
every six months they need to rebase the

00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,880
whole thing and they're basically doing

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,890
nothing but rebase their patches on the

00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:15,940
upstream as it changes right and that's

00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:19,330
horribly inefficient for everyone and I

00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:22,400
think sort of the the incentive as the

00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:25,220
person who has the contact with with

00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,330
and users is always going to be that but

00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,970
I like the problem is that those

00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:30,590
decisions can no longer happen at the

00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:34,340
downstream level because the integration

00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:37,520
is already happening upstream um right

00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:39,080
and so these problems are not new and I

00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,060
think people have thought about them for

00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:44,120
a long time and we have some solutions

00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:47,000
for them now right we're now at the

00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,820
point with flat pack and flat top and so

00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,340
on we're like you you can start making

00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:54,230
an app in your own builder you can test

00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:56,750
the flat pack on your machine and you

00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:58,190
can distribute it to flat top tomorrow

00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,600
and people are going to be able to

00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,890
download that app and then if you update

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,260
it next week people are gonna get the

00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:06,620
update and that's something that we like

00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:10,490
never had before so we're we are making

00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:13,400
progress in this right um the problem is

00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:15,080
that it doesn't neatly solve all of the

00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,960
issues that that we mentioned before

00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:20,150
because that desktop distro thing is

00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,220
still there and there's still a lot of

00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:24,110
stuff that that kind of like touches

00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,870
these these various pieces from the host

00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:29,870
system so you can't completely ignore

00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:31,460
the host because for well yes for two

00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:34,460
sets of reasons there's the technical

00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:37,070
side of it which is that if your host

00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:38,750
has an old flat back version and the app

00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:40,100
uses like a portal to get a location or

00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,740
something and the flat pack version

00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,630
doesn't support that it's not gonna work

00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,840
if you're trying to get a calendar or

00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:49,460
something so evolution data server and

00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:52,850
the host doesn't have that same version

00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:55,310
of that API it's not gonna work various

00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:57,020
things about display servers drivers and

00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,820
so on like basically every interaction

00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,500
everything that is not in the subtext

00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,670
and Parkson like that you need to

00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,670
interact with the host with can

00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:07,340
potentially break stuff and so the app

00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:09,650
developer story is not solved like from

00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:15,050
that perspective and then there's the

00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:17,200
back side of that where I mean like your

00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:19,520
app is not just like a rectangle that

00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,230
runs on people's screens right like

00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,400
there are various integration points

00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:25,250
from a user perspective where like

00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,650
there's notifications there's we used to

00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,240
have like in the top shell top hour we

00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,800
used to be like an app menu which we

00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,510
recently changed which is now in the

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,570
application windows or like if you have

00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:37,010
an older version of the system your

00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,510
system apps are gonna have the menu up

00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,500
there and the new flat pack apps are

00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,730
gonna have it in the window which is

00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,380
confusing

00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:46,000
obviously the usual stuff around

00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:48,350
stylesheet style sheets and theming so

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,600
flat pack currently uses the system

00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:53,570
stylesheet and icons in all the

00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:56,120
flat-pack apps so if the developer test

00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:57,890
with the default like system stylesheet

00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,870
and then you run the app on some

00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,250
distribution that doesn't use that well

00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,080
there's still the same potential for

00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:06,140
break it so we haven't actually

00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:08,240
completely solved this these issues even

00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:10,460
for app developers but the other thing

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,030
is that even though like we sort of can

00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:15,410
now ship apps directly the left side of

00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:17,360
the thing we haven't actually solved

00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:20,180
right like death of developers are still

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,930
facing all the same problems and those

00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:25,850
district s top conflicts will need to be

00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:31,880
addressed in order to actually fix the

00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:33,200
whole problem and I think and and those

00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,120
are others actually come in three

00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,580
stripes there are the structural ones we

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,130
just think surely come from the fact

00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,900
that from the incentives and how they're

00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:44,060
set up around the sole ecosystem and

00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,860
they're very hard to fix those

00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,660
fragmentation ones which more or less

00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,040
come from there being multiple of

00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,750
everything and then there's the

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,250
configuration ones which are slightly

00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,210
easier but still contribute to the

00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,390
overall experience

00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:58,250
being not great sometimes so the

00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:00,920
structure ones are the hard ones because

00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:02,740
release schedules are really tough to

00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,390
align right

00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:07,160
geurim reviews every six months distros

00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:12,290
release anywhere between six months and

00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:14,720
like three years until sort of that's

00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:17,329
aligned somehow or like we have some

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,770
solution for that that's gonna be a huge

00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:20,240
issue because you might run a super new

00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:22,339
app on a very old system or the other

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,010
way around and at every point there's

00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:26,689
like friction happening your system

00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,180
reacts changes that's the thing that we

00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:30,740
mentioned before with endless we're like

00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:32,270
you have a problem downstream you wanna

00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:34,520
fix it by like I don't know making some

00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,960
change to your shell but then you now

00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,780
have a bunch of downstream patches and

00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,240
not only are you creating huge amounts

00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,950
work for yourself in the future

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,600
you're also fragmenting everything for

00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,220
everyone because now after overs have to

00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,080
think about like well unless the thing

00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,790
is here and like on a blue - it's there

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,120
I don't photo right here

00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:55,280
and like the complexity keys ballooning

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,470
with everyone who does that and then

00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,280
there's obviously seaming which yeah I

00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:03,080
mean don't change API from under people

00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,520
and like the latest to green throughout

00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,830
the s is maybe a good example because

00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,140
like under release schedule site they

00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:13,040
like have about an algorithm 328 like

00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:15,350
some very old version but like in the

00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,420
meantime the sign guidelines changed so

00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,890
the app menu which used to be like up

00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,930
there in the top left is now in the

00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,090
window so if you install even like the

00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:25,100
sort of you install flat back on it and

00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:29,240
you install some new maps gonna be

00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:30,920
somewhere else you X changes stuff like

00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,190
sort of solving problems downstream

00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:36,770
I guess that like I don't know they

00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:39,290
needed to somehow like make people from

00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:41,000
unity sort of like feel at home so okay

00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:44,210
what can we do maybe we like add a Docs

00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,320
to the left or something and that's a

00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:47,510
very understandable thought process

00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,920
right but the problem is that the end

00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:51,830
result is never gonna be good because

00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,390
like if you make these fundamental UX

00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:56,000
changes to a system you need to actually

00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:57,470
go all the way through because like what

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
we ended up now is like there's a weird

00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,430
app button at the bottom and there's the

00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,380
activities at the top and then you have

00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:06,770
this permanent doc but also you have the

00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:08,630
overview which really doesn't match and

00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:11,120
the end result is not only like

00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:12,500
fragmentation for everyone but also like

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,030
a subpar experience cuz these things

00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,580
have not been designed together right

00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:19,040
you these decisions can a can't be taken

00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,870
downstream and then there's theming

00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,130
which yeah like I mean that there's like

00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:27,500
a button there to create a new folder

00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:29,090
that's invisible which is not great oh

00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:34,370
yeah and there's an extra column in the

00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:36,310
side of the I don't know and then we

00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:38,570
have fragmentation issues which are

00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:40,250
basically the issues that arise from us

00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:42,680
having the multiple versions of

00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:45,200
everything so for example there is no no

00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:47,570
installer and every destroy it rolls our

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,590
own because it's really hard to abstract

00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:52,520
across like what all the various

00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:54,260
districts do we have lots of different

00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,120
package formats which we have tried to

00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:58,100
abstract across but that has caused lots

00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,440
of issues which is why ignore software

00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,660
is kind of like a little bit like you

00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,110
sometimes because it's really hard to

00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,450
keep

00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:08,809
all of that working sort of across

00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:10,940
various different abstractions and the

00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:12,980
great example there is as usual the

00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:16,910
fedora installer which famously

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:18,440
confusing configuration issues are a

00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:20,929
little bit less of a problem from an app

00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,940
developer perspective but they kind of

00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:26,570
are a problem for my UX perspective just

00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:28,340
overall because there are various

00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:32,030
settings that happen at the distribution

00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:35,030
level but really are part of the whole

00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:36,860
experience so like the default apps that

00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:40,280
you ship should actually fit in with the

00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:43,880
whole system right and the way I don't

00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:46,760
know like the the interfaces for like

00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:50,000
unlocking the this encryption thing when

00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,290
you boot up should probably be designed

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,080
at the same time as the rest of the

00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:57,020
system but because things are configured

00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:00,169
downstream just can it doesn't work and

00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:01,940
it's a great example there is this which

00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:05,540
are these random strings when you want

00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:13,190
to unlock your disk which really doesn't

00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:16,580
feel like part of the experience so

00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:20,090
problem where does if our ecosystem

00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:22,309
currently if you want healthy abacus

00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:25,280
system which is I guess why we are all

00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:27,230
here in the Linux application summit we

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,730
need the real platforms and if we need

00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:31,220
the real platforms we'll need to address

00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:34,280
the conflicts that are there exist

00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:38,540
currently between the desktop developers

00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:41,330
and the distributors instead of a term

00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:44,299
developers having target and different

00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:48,080
metrics of distributions they suddenly

00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:50,960
are currently targeting desktop

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,940
platforms essentially and it already

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,250
works that way but when they ship their

00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:57,710
application they have to account for all

00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:00,890
the different configurations of a

00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:06,250
desktop platform that might exist in sa

00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:09,559
very address various distributions so

00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:10,940
how could you like address that is we

00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:12,610
could like take a look at the flat pack

00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,480
example how it works currently

00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:16,820
placas

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,309
design from the start with two condoms

00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:21,049
the Namrata band the KD random there

00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:23,059
were like no distribution around times

00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:24,950
because the solutions were not the are

00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:28,129
not the pub the platforms and they are

00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:29,359
not what the developers targeting the

00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:31,220
rest of the values have complete control

00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:35,690
over the run times they're built from

00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:39,379
scratch not dependent on anything and SS

00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:41,269
eluted like this which would be like the

00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:43,549
desktop developers saving their software

00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:46,850
directly end-users and bypassing the

00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:49,480
distress be the distribution stress on

00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:52,129
it like the app developers do currently

00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:55,129
but this is not likely in the short term

00:22:52,129 --> 00:22:58,519
because we it requires a lot of amount

00:22:55,129 --> 00:23:00,710
of work and resources that no project

00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:03,619
currently has and all will have another

00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:06,710
your fields are most likely so we're end

00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:09,559
up with something like this so this

00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:12,200
almost the kind of thing but the main

00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:14,090
point here is how the desktop developers

00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,399
and distribution routes need to start

00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:19,149
working closer together and be more

00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:21,529
engaged across their issues and

00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:24,590
coordinate more about all of the

00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:26,359
decisions if they have if you make

00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,799
exchanges it doesn't danceable

00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:31,700
distribution that doesn't accept an

00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:33,950
issue bring that up a stream like why

00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:36,200
the what problem do you re trying to

00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:39,019
solve why is it like that what stars

00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,789
have you done and if it's a good change

00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:49,129
let's upstream it and so everybody

00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:51,409
canons can yeah from it so yeah there's

00:23:49,129 --> 00:23:54,230
a double slide so how do you like

00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:57,499
address the issues we discussed a bit

00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:59,779
earlier the synchronous is really suck

00:23:57,499 --> 00:24:04,249
is like probably the hardest one because

00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:06,590
it affects how both both the

00:24:04,249 --> 00:24:09,200
distribution sent the various platforms

00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:12,440
function currently and it probably not

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,809
gonna be solved we could have we could

00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:18,159
start discussions about having long term

00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:20,570
support versions of the environments or

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:24,529
aligning the release a little bit better

00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:26,239
so not everybody is not people are that

00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:28,130
is some distribution is an six month

00:24:26,239 --> 00:24:32,930
another reason a yearly cycle

00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:36,740
whatever dancing exchanges are a bit

00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:38,870
weird because the extroverts are

00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,790
designed properly there they have their

00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:43,010
own design team and they do testing and

00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:45,980
when you as a downstream distributor

00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:50,480
they start making decisions for them

00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:52,100
you'd ignore all of the all the research

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,080
they might have done of the user testing

00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,420
and started validating the design

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,510
process which can lead to all this

00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:01,100
confusing issues so if you want if

00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:03,650
you're the say dancing distributor and

00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,960
you want to do the UXA this the best

00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:08,930
path to all that is like start the

00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:11,300
discussion upstream first and then we

00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:14,780
see how we can time you problem be

00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:17,270
addressed so for branding which is and

00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:19,430
another reason why distributors change

00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:22,840
things underneath the desk of developers

00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:25,370
and then the application developers is

00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,350
currently there is like no way to do it

00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:31,480
and everybody's poking around private

00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:35,450
CSS variables and which ends up causing

00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:37,190
her whole class of issues imagine like

00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,710
taking the scissors from one web page

00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:41,210
and expecting to work on another because

00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:45,410
it's the same thing with theming

00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:48,340
currently the decay and it's not just

00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:51,680
that that you can have intrusive

00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:55,100
distribution branding like Big Oil

00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:58,520
watermark logos that the overlay over

00:25:55,100 --> 00:26:01,130
something or things that are always in

00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:03,530
the spotlight cause you want the people

00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:05,630
to know that you're using this

00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:08,060
particular distribution but that really

00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:10,190
can mess with the experience that the

00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:16,640
deliver that the developer is trying to

00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:19,130
provide so yeah we need probably need

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,820
better branding abs and like these needs

00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:22,700
to be discussed

00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:27,950
upstream first also and find a common

00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:30,770
way to worked or something like that for

00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:33,920
the from accommodation issues there bit

00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:35,900
weird for those installer there's like

00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,120
no probably no way you can share the

00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:40,340
back end for this tile but at least you

00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,930
can have a common design so not

00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:46,430
everything feels out of place and

00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:49,520
confusing if you take happen since your

00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:52,130
distribution you are using for the

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:55,060
packet this issues we have flat back now

00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:58,010
and other containers formats with which

00:26:55,060 --> 00:27:00,110
essentially may get the application

00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:03,140
developers in control of the packaging

00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:07,540
at that by completely can bypass most of

00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:11,060
the issues and if we start like

00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:12,890
switching from the it's disrespect at

00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:16,190
manager to their cotton Alice

00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:18,710
application formats we're using to sip

00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:21,770
publication now we can like ignore a

00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:23,900
whole class of issues that arise in no

00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:27,650
software YouTube packet kit and ranked

00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:29,630
up struck out over the whole world for

00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:30,380
the configuration issues it's

00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:32,180
understandable

00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:34,550
you might want to have a certain

00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:37,850
behavior in the distribution but most of

00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:40,610
the time you're trying to address a

00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:43,160
problem and if you like having any

00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:45,500
issues if you have identified issues

00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:50,240
with a certain setting like the touchpad

00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:52,760
settings in that or I'll tap behavior

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,860
it's much better start to bring that

00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,630
problem upstream and also started

00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,700
discussing there because it's probably

00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:01,210
not your just your users that are

00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,210
affected by this

00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:06,710
the default apps

00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:08,930
at least the NAM has this notion of

00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:10,700
default code of set of apps that we

00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:15,200
encourage dancer distributors to shape

00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:17,000
that isn't happened today and with it's

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,030
understandable because these revisions

00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:24,470
want a certain set of packages but we'd

00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:26,690
like to know why some things some

00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:30,080
distributions might choose to shape

00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:32,630
evolution over Gary or whatever other

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,120
example of application and how we could

00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:37,760
improve this how would you like get the

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:41,270
distributor's more aligned with how we

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,760
expect the environment to be and the

00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:48,350
climate the Buddha exper experience is a

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:50,690
good example here also cause climate

00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:53,570
there in the latest version that will be

00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:54,650
released soon as received a new update

00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,909
were includes

00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:58,549
branding APs

00:28:55,909 --> 00:29:00,679
this Riveter scarlet the logo in a

00:28:58,549 --> 00:29:02,539
non-intrusive way that does not affect

00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:04,969
the experience of putting up and we

00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:07,759
still can recognize this is climate this

00:29:04,969 --> 00:29:11,809
is this desktop environment this

00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:19,429
platform and so in short upstream all

00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:22,179
the things yeah right so yeah we have

00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:24,859
like one minute so super quick summary

00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:28,309
essentially what we'd like to convince

00:29:24,859 --> 00:29:29,690
you of is that Linux right Linux is

00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:31,009
really not the thing which we should be

00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:34,190
talking about we should be talking about

00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:36,109
actual platforms because that's what we

00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:38,989
need to get these apps right if you want

00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:40,549
a great sort of ecosystem of third-party

00:29:38,989 --> 00:29:42,949
apps you need to first get those

00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:45,139
platforms in order and in order to do

00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:47,659
that we'll need to figure out a way

00:29:45,139 --> 00:29:50,329
whether that's like sort of dedicated

00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:52,489
platform os's or it's everyone working

00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:54,979
together more but that's the thing I

00:29:52,489 --> 00:29:56,599
think we should be focusing on yeah

00:29:54,979 --> 00:29:59,299
let's make things happen if you have

00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:01,309
ideas to that effect like let's talk

00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:04,429
later or we're still gonna be here for a

00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:07,219
few days and I don't think these issues

00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:10,269
are gonna go away anytime soon

00:30:07,219 --> 00:30:12,469
but we should at least work towards

00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:14,700
starting to mitigate them and improving

00:30:12,469 --> 00:30:19,710
things a little bit thank you

00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:19,710
