00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:11,639
okay so hi everyone my name is Jana

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,219
Corrie and I'm going to talk about how

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:18,930
we are trying to improve the cute

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:19,980
situation in the gnome desktop so let me

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:24,380
introduce myself

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:27,779
I work in the redhead discipline where I

00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:32,399
mostly maintain KDM tooth on rail and I

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:36,170
also contribute to Oh cute and KD on Tim

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:40,500
and when I join the redhead I also

00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:45,350
started contributing to KD so I'm Katie

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:49,559
developer since I voted for ahead and

00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:52,199
the stuff I'd do there is related to on

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:56,010
network manager so I've readied the new

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:58,649
post monitor management applet and the

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:02,579
stuff I do now mostly is flat pack

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:05,040
integration so I've wrote the feedback

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:09,740
and the implementation of cutback

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:13,860
Porthos but I am here now so it's

00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,520
because we now have more desktop we have

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,850
been armed

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:21,600
we have KD each of them prefers

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:24,770
different cookies and each to T then

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:29,790
this top have usually different style

00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:32,820
and look and why because developers know

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:36,720
that and when you develop trigger like

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:40,829
application for genome in GT k you know

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,540
your target your system your desktop so

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:45,479
you know you the application will look

00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,369
good but they are actually users who

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:52,549
might use your applications on a

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:58,219
different desktop so the user usually

00:01:52,549 --> 00:02:02,579
doesn't doesn't care what to eat or

00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:06,719
desktop you just won the application to

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:09,690
fit into the wall ecosystem he doesn't

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,860
want to have his application to end up

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,710
like this little Zack

00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:21,790
who doesn't belong to the group the

00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:26,350
other other application so because - I

00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:30,490
solve this problem he'll have pretty

00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:33,640
good like way to support and target

00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:35,010
multiple platforms this is all based on

00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,300
plugins

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,120
so when cute around the venue

00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,910
application tab so cute tries to detect

00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:46,780
your platform your desktop and bits of

00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:49,810
based on debt it detects what platform

00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:55,570
plug-in or platform team into use but

00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:57,580
some plugins are plugins which handle

00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:01,780
the windowing system so if you run your

00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:03,940
application on x11 then xev plug it back

00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,190
in for some parking will be used when

00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,480
you run your application on valence then

00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,400
they'll install some plugins will be

00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:16,450
used then we have platform team begins

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:19,510
those so target the desktops will say so

00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:22,720
with your on KD then kadiebug home team

00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:25,270
of plugins will be will be used and we

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,850
will try this plugin will try to read

00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:31,630
your KD configuration and apply this

00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:36,090
configuration to do running kids up then

00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:40,240
we have style plugins those are

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:42,580
basically the widget styles used in the

00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:46,680
application and then there are also

00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:49,570
other plugins for printing networks so

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,270
we have for example caps plugin for

00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:58,840
printing on linux for windows there's

00:03:52,270 --> 00:04:02,020
another one and if we go the tube turn

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,680
history gives actually has been trying

00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:08,050
to support you Nam

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:12,489
so I don't I don't really remember times

00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:16,930
before choose for rich kids for and to

00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:18,630
spice up to fine 45.7 there was a few

00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:22,410
gtk style

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:26,490
there was a style trying to

00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:29,550
bank or killed we just look like gtk the

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:33,920
way it was written it was using gtk

00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:38,160
directly to pain all the widgets and

00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:40,830
then we had huge etk to team which was

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:45,660
reading the gtk and genome configuration

00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:51,000
and applying them to his application but

00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:55,890
it was or gtk to based and since with

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,280
youth by 14 7 the GTA 2 team was ported

00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:03,810
to just a free and because nobody ported

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:07,290
to the qgj style to gtk free it was

00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:09,060
smooth removed from field 5 to some

00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,980
extra extra plugins or something like

00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,040
that because it cannot be combined you

00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:18,810
cannot combine gtk to be GTA free and I

00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:21,300
think even for the GTPase free taming it

00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:24,890
wasn't no longer possible to use is it

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:28,890
the same way how it was used with GTA 2

00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:35,720
so we ended up with just a free team

00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:40,230
since fuse 5.7 which all the only thing

00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:42,330
you gtk free - free team does just reach

00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:45,150
the configuration which means your

00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:47,850
it--what icons they use both phones and

00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:52,560
such apprise them to your application

00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:55,970
but you didn't have the widget style and

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:59,780
some other stuff I gonna mention later

00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:03,620
so because of this we started writing

00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:06,810
children on platform which is we just

00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:10,590
sort of the same thing as you GT k 3

00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:15,600
team but we wanted to add some other

00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:18,540
stuff other stuff on top of that so the

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,910
key features of signal platform as I

00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:24,240
mentioned the things that expedite free

00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:27,120
team we read your phone team icons and

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,790
we apply this to your food application

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,730
we have native dialogues for file

00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:35,760
chooser color picker and

00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:39,690
for tequila but I did not Naughty Dog's

00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:42,840
also in the qgk free team but what is

00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:46,050
what's not in Puget a frame team for

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:48,330
example we have cinnamon support because

00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:51,900
the way we read the configuration we use

00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:56,450
G setting scheme and cinnamon we uses

00:06:51,900 --> 00:07:00,960
some different bands from from Tottenham

00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:04,650
that we have support for that and most

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,980
importantly we have support for flat

00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:10,140
back and snap because then your

00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:14,130
application runs in plat bag or snap

00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:17,700
it's isolated from the system so until

00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:20,940
some time ago we had some like access

00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:23,310
with finding the runtime that the field

00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:28,290
application can access the cones to read

00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:32,550
the configuration but with portals we no

00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:36,930
longer need that so we have recently we

00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:39,300
added support for setting Sporto so when

00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:44,780
your application or application that

00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:48,270
takes it runs in first by on snap it

00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:51,390
detects so it's isolated it talks to the

00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:55,830
Porto asks for the or the configuration

00:07:51,390 --> 00:08:02,040
we need and the portawheel depending on

00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:04,500
the backend read your own configuration

00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:08,450
and it will send it back to the

00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:12,120
application and we can then apply it

00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:14,040
without needing some access specified in

00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,250
the writer in the runtime or in the

00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:20,760
application and we are sitting on

00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:23,190
platform is also available on perhaps we

00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:28,620
made in our daily run time we made

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:32,760
extension points for all 12 17 so it

00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:36,210
should be when plastic detects

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:39,150
you ran drum it automatically pulls in

00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:41,300
children on platform as so a plug-in

00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:45,470
when you are installing

00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:48,220
any use application and recently the

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:51,290
divers working on is support for valent

00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:54,980
because you know is supports only

00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:58,880
client-side decorations so we had to

00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:02,780
implement them ourselves so I was

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:09,410
working on this it still needs a lot of

00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:12,170
work but what we do now using the fuse

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:14,270
no platform I I can read the gnome

00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:17,330
configuration I know the position of the

00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:19,970
electrode button so whether you use them

00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:21,980
or not their position to the left or

00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:27,860
right so I can read that

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:29,990
using theme and I think this information

00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,580
and then I'm trying to write the

00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:36,380
Declaration which should look like a

00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:38,030
writer there's still some work needed

00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:41,360
for example we don't have support for

00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:44,120
shadows because this support is not even

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,420
in view of Valen itself I have some

00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,400
patches but it still need some work my

00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,060
implementation of shadows doesn't really

00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,880
look great

00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:59,150
there is not something I want to publish

00:09:52,880 --> 00:10:01,370
it and then because so platform team is

00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:04,070
not enough to make your application

00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:08,510
really fit into the desktop you need

00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:12,710
also widget style so we have a project

00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:16,810
called advise active it's a new style so

00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:21,020
we defined the look of your widget and

00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:26,210
we support both for the light and dark

00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:28,460
version of advaitha recently I also

00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:32,300
added support for the new refresh

00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:36,920
advaita team because so that changed

00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:40,850
with the recent gtk you might have seen

00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:45,140
change so we needed to refresh so this

00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:47,350
is how the old Advaita and cute looks

00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,350
like

00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:54,920
and this is after the refresh we should

00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:58,430
match the current Advaita Q team here I

00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:05,000
have for comparison this is dissipation

00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:08,570
with the beta compare it it is not

00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,940
really like perfect but I think it's

00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:14,390
much much closer than what we had for

00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:16,310
what we had before and it's frightening

00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:20,240
a few style is not a really simple

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:22,760
process because the way you've right

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,880
right it you defined every every

00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:28,370
vignette consists from multiple like

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:32,900
basic objects so if any want to for

00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:35,750
example paint a button you define paint

00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:38,690
a rectangle then you paint a shadow and

00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:41,360
and then you throw it it takes inside

00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:45,440
and you do that for every single digit

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,900
so it's really complex process so it's

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,890
not really easy but I think they've been

00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:56,870
successful with this and if you look to

00:11:51,890 --> 00:12:00,620
the future so what I would like for

00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:06,200
signal platform to improve the valence

00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:08,330
situation should we really need to as I

00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,030
said we have super missing support for

00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:14,110
shadows so I would like to finish that

00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:18,230
and also at the support secured valence

00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:20,510
anything even the John has the buttons

00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:23,630
animated so it's been your mouse over

00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:28,100
the the button you don't see any any

00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:30,020
effect so I had this implemented but

00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:34,070
then something you'd wear and change and

00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:36,560
that broke my implementation so today

00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:39,530
there is no native to point you balance

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,890
for this so I don't need to find a way

00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:47,960
how to implement this properly and for

00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:50,840
advaitha cute besides many many 6s which

00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,630
you probably need to do to make it look

00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:57,620
more like current raita

00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:59,660
in solution we might want to add style

00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:03,400
40 ml components

00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:06,080
when we move to let's say mobile Wharf I

00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:09,170
expect most of the application to be

00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:13,300
written in UML because it's really

00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:16,340
simple and make sense for the mobile to

00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:19,940
the most likely meet or advisor theme

00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:22,930
for two more components and then next

00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:26,990
year q6 is probably going to happen

00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:29,870
that's probably in then not going to be

00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:32,540
changes in the plug-in infrastructure

00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:36,440
and the API inside but what I would like

00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:40,010
to do for q6 to move to Dropbox form and

00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:43,970
advaita cute to be part of itself

00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:48,320
because right now it was fine to have it

00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:50,480
separate it because I didn't have to go

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,290
through all the reviews and follow the

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:57,550
recycle but when they are like right

00:13:54,290 --> 00:14:00,490
feature complete it would be nice to

00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:03,250
move the plugins in side views itself

00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:07,720
but the problem the problem here is that

00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:11,420
the Advaita cute because it's based on

00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:15,620
plasma brief style and it still has GPL

00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:18,230
free license and because of that we are

00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,720
not able to we don't need to realize

00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:24,380
since it first so that means asking

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,840
everyone who contributed to it to agree

00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:29,540
with your a licensing and then we can

00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:33,400
probably move it to field and then we go

00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,400
through the review process and so on I

00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:38,920
guess that's it and so if you have any

00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,920
questions

00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:48,720
[Applause]

00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:09,700
so you mentioned native dialogues that

00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:12,190
file dialogues among others what about

00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,590
printing does this include non printing

00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:17,920
dialogue as well no it doesn't include

00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:20,290
non printing and if not why not because

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:24,360
nobody implemented yet because I'm

00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:28,210
mostly just me who does all this hat

00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:30,640
down okay other contributors so doing

00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:34,060
all the work myself it's a lot of work

00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:37,660
so I say I appreciate it so I have to

00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:40,440
like choice of words what is in higher

00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,440
priority

00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:14,180
I guess there are no other questions so

00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:14,180
