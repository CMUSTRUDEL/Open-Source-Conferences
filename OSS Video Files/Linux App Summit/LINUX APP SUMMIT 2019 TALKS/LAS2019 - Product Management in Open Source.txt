hello yes that's better

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:16,680
good hello up there so first of all I'd

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,160
like to start with an apology it's a

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,240
very deep apology I can't talk very well

00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,670
there has been a little over

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,900
enthusiastic collaboration during this

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:32,130
conference and as such that means you're

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:34,110
gonna get slightly less energetic than

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,260
my normal I hope

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,000
maude moderate standard of presentation

00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:41,579
which would be more similar to this we

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,690
dance sing around the stage thankfully I

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,739
won't be doing that as well because the

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,219
stage is really noisy

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,930
if keep shuffling around the stage

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,460
please someone raise your hands or

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,539
something I know it's gonna be really

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:57,600
irritating for the people later

00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:59,489
secondly ml gave a really really really

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,840
good talk on Tuesday if you weren't here

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,830
or didn't see it you should watch the

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,750
video it's had contained about

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,510
two-thirds of the talks I was going to

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,810
give when I first came so this talk has

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,400
been hastily rewritten which is good in

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,049
many ways it's been significantly

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,220
improved you'll get all exciting new

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:24,780
content but ya don't see her talk again

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,830
it was really good and now my name is

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,310
Nick Richards hello

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:31,710
hi I'm product manager I work on flap

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,930
amongst other things I've worked on

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,420
grain stuff for years and years and

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,000
years and years and years but I am also

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,820
one of the few going foundation members

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,549
who is also a KD member thanks to the

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,619
magic of flat hub contributing across

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,180
everything

00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:50,390
I'm a former product manager endless

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,590
thus the marvelous computer I'm using

00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:54,600
and at the moment now I work for a

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,159
company called lucid who are no interest

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,740
whatsoever and open source apart from

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,130
paying people to provide services on

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,259
open source code which is good too I was

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:07,170
also one of the themes mostly service

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:10,950
thing was prime I know Joe Christian

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,150
knows he's not here it's very sad but so

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,920
he wrote a really really good blog post

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,390
which I will encourage you to look at

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,209
this one doesn't have the URL but I'll

00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,370
publish some stuff later which does so

00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:24,510
he says this they take feedback from

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:26,490
everywhere they do all kinds of cool

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,230
stuff you can read that most importantly

00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,180
the role is leadership it's kind of

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:35,490
interesting the idea of a leadership

00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:37,290
type role in a an organization or a sort

00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,270
of a an area which is historically

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,750
driven by coders scratch than their own

00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:44,040
itch what does a product manager

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,420
actually do because I mean that kind of

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,070
tells you what you're supposed to do but

00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,750
what do you actually do hopefully I'm

00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:53,130
going to give you a bit of a clue for

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:56,550
some of that stuff tell a story so every

00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:58,350
application has a story they they speak

00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:01,050
about like the points of view of the

00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,360
application who should be using it what

00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:07,620
the where it can fit into your life as a

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,420
person or a user and those which I have

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,400
really compelling stories and stories

00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:15,860
that that really resonate with people

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:18,239
are those that they're very successful

00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,709
so you then integrate all the things you

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,410
get feedback and you get stuff coming

00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:24,870
from all over the place and product

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,640
managers jobs are to really be the

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,120
inverse of the person who goes and sits

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,970
in a dark corner and just code stuff all

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,040
the time is a very important role to

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,329
play your own phone like that but this

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,250
is much more about trying to integrate

00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:40,769
stuff together and keep people on the

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,180
same page that's story part again if you

00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:44,010
can tell everyone the same story then

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,040
they'll basically be kind of working it

00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:49,230
out themselves and thirdly your old is

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,780
to maintain standards and to say it's

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:55,260
not quite good enough it's not really

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:57,329
what we're trying to do here but kind of

00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,350
when you put it down to it it's just

00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:04,019
saying them in a nice way all the time

00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:07,260
it's a it's a you know improv style you

00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:09,930
know no but you know what can we do next

00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,850
how can we go from here to there where

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,130
we both want to go or have you

00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,560
considered if we turn this contribution

00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,549
around in a slightly different direction

00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,180
it can work a lot better and we can

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:24,780
integrate it we can all be more you know

00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,800
all meet meet everyone's goals so it

00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,590
doesn't sound like a great app

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,510
maintainer yes basically it does

00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,310
so why do you care pretty much everyone

00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,360
who maintains apps here is doing it

00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,580
successfully otherwise they wouldn't

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,090
have come all the way here you do this

00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:41,940
already but I think that's Christian can

00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:44,250
talk about this he says I spend all my

00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,110
time doing this stuff it wears me out it

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,900
tires me out it's not fun

00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,950
I'd prefer just to spend my time coding

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,230
so you can either get some help from

00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:56,250
someone like me or maybe I can help you

00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:58,440
do it a bit more efficiently so let's do

00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:02,730
it's better this is an exciting example

00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:05,850
of some highly proprietary visual design

00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:10,200
for the meego tablets right there and

00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:11,550
that sees and herbart bad look you can

00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,870
now save much more space for this

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:18,240
exciting way of writing an email

00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:19,560
composer so we'll go back again what are

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,810
the tasks that we're trying to do we're

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,590
trying to finally find the story

00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,180
identify all the things and then we're

00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,740
trying to maintain standards no I'm

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,960
gonna talk about all of those during

00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,169
this conversation that Sam will give

00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,030
give you a bit of it ok now so how do

00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:34,800
you find your story there these days

00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,380
pretty much what everyone does when

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,870
they're making programs is they write a

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,790
list that list is a set of requirements

00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,039
that the thing has to do it might be a

00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:47,460
readme file in your in your repository

00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:51,360
it might be a wiki page it might be some

00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,890
kind of exciting long Google Doc it

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,840
might be all kinds of stuff but it says

00:05:52,890 --> 00:06:00,539
what is the thing going to do ok then

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,820
you turn this list into tickets isn't

00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:04,979
this fun you can have loads of tickets

00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,620
it's some G edit tickets look somebody's

00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:09,800
a bug tickets some of these are features

00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:13,979
some of them are just like people

00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,210
expressing their points of view cool

00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,919
great so you're thinking I've got

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,539
requirements I can go through these

00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:21,479
requirements one by one like can turn

00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:25,320
them into tickets you have already lost

00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:27,000
you're lost I tell you you you haven't

00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,650
thought about where you're trying to get

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,539
to here like this is the absolute

00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,400
classic thing that people do in terms of

00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:33,570
incremental improvements for your

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,940
projects

00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:38,250
is sort of being driven by the backlog

00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:40,590
being driven by the few of the things

00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,320
that people do or tell you you need to

00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,790
do

00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,410
and not really thinking about why are we

00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,930
trying to get to there what's the most

00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:48,490
important thing the thing that a product

00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:50,710
manager or product thinking can help you

00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,540
do is identify what's the most important

00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:57,030
thing then let's do it now the other

00:06:52,540 --> 00:07:01,030
stuff may be helpful but is it important

00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:05,050
say what you need to do you need to find

00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:06,190
some of your story great apps have a

00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,020
point of view

00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,880
I loved name builder it's one of my

00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,650
favorite applications I use it all the

00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,680
time for a variety of things it wasn't

00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:17,200
designed to do including writing lists

00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,970
all kinds of stuff but one of the things

00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,490
that that I think is most inspiring to

00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,810
me about this is how clearly Christian

00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,500
had a points of view about this

00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,630
application

00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,910
what he wanted it to do what he didn't

00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:30,010
want it to do the ways he wanted people

00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:32,170
to be able to contribute to it the areas

00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:36,880
where other people would be able to

00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:38,500
extend it and how kind of the world he

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,970
wanted to create out of this you know

00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,030
what would an ideal world for this

00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:46,660
publication be and then try and move the

00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:48,490
worlds more towards that I did email if

00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:53,320
we could all be that good I would be but

00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:54,940
sir and so how do you find all the story

00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,840
if you're not Christian if you don't

00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,600
have this thing that you've been

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,300
spending 15 years thinking about so it's

00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,040
a mixture of your in your you internal

00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,860
drive and your user satisfaction I

00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:08,970
mentioned earlier about the classic open

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:11,110
source scratching your own itch theory I

00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:13,920
believe that's actually very important

00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:16,630
for really really good applications

00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,330
particularly those that live it in a

00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:21,730
kind of an open source world where

00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:24,130
monetization currently is less good than

00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:26,320
we'd all like it to be you really are

00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:29,350
going to need a lot of internal

00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,210
self-starting but also something that

00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,310
really satisfies your needs you know

00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:35,110
like there is a reason why there are

00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:37,660
quite so many music players available

00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,219
right people like playing music they

00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,770
like doing this they have very strong

00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:43,479
opinions about it and if it works for

00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,160
them I mean that's great like this this

00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:47,350
is the kind of thing that is why is it

00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,790
self starting why does it work still not

00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,800
quite sure why we have so many clocks in

00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:54,400
the world but that's a different

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,060
different question so what's a good

00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,470
first step

00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,730
so you've kind of worked out you've

00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,010
probably worked at your own internal

00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:02,890
drive already I can't really tell you

00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:05,290
what that is sadly but I can tell you

00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:07,690
some other stuff so write some things

00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:08,800
down so what I'm going to tell you is

00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:13,089
think about the application you're

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:15,070
working on write down every single

00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:19,270
potential competitor that you can think

00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:20,920
of in about 25 seconds no one's writing

00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:24,700
but that's okay I'm gonna do it in a

00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:27,480
second so just write down all that stuff

00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:30,220
proprietary free different platform

00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,380
completely left field you know if it's a

00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,850
duelist the answer might be sticking

00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,220
stuff on the fridge is actually a

00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:37,300
competitors of my share of time it might

00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,029
be that people would prefer to watch

00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:42,610
Netflix rather than make lists like all

00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:44,500
this kind of stuff so I'll give you an

00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,810
example of a flat hub because it's

00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,630
easier that way and it's what I spend

00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:51,910
most of my time caring about same here

00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:54,940
are some things snap obvious competitor

00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:57,040
google play literally someone we could

00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:59,290
be inspired by or compete with Apple's

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,810
App Store this froze that's a way people

00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:09,330
get applications Windows Store app image

00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:11,320
strained for true say for for the list

00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:13,030
how do you know how does each one of

00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,860
those things reach the user what

00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:16,360
problems they're gonna solve what is

00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,370
good or bad about them what's easy or

00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,660
hard to copy same just kind of you know

00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:21,520
write all of those down kind of off the

00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,770
top of your head so I'll give you an

00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,140
example from the top they're a very low

00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:27,839
resolution version of Starcraft I'm very

00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,920
sorry for that that was supposed to be a

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,730
significantly better thing but I blame

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,290
low dpi say snap reaches the user

00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,910
through pre loading in the most popular

00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:39,490
the next so yes it's a very good way to

00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:41,050
reach the user it has a really really

00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,450
great developer outreach story as we

00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:45,190
literally just heard and also some

00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:47,320
really really good websites it's finding

00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,400
this stuff and it's very easy to get

00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,230
started with if you're already working

00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,360
on a buncee which has previously

00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:54,190
mentioned is the most popular Linux OS

00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,350
so you're kind are going to be likely to

00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:59,279
at least know a little bit about it it's

00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:01,300
a strong assumption someone implemented

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,040
implementation details have historic

00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:06,370
warts around them based on where it

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,600
comes from around the phone and there's

00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,990
a bit of a store lock into an advanced

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,649
you managed service which

00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:15,949
strength or a weakness but is what it is

00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:18,819
so oh yeah then say what what do I say

00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:20,899
from that what does this imply for me

00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:23,389
actually there's one other slide for

00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:25,759
here so examples of people who do this

00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:26,929
really well claim design team really

00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,079
really excellent at doing this

00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:31,160
these wiki pages which have what are we

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,779
kind of doing at the top what's our

00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,199
goals what are non goals here are some

00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:37,850
relevant arts look this application

00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:39,379
settings on the Mac this is what

00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,759
elementary do about it this is what

00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:43,040
Windows do about it this is what highest

00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:44,990
does about it it's not going you know

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,850
start your photocopiers it's just going

00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:49,160
what however other people try to solve

00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,819
the same problems or alternatively

00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,050
if we look at the goals and non goals

00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:55,910
are these actually the same problems

00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:57,410
like maybe there's a good reason why we

00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:59,059
shouldn't fall into this trap of just

00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,860
copying these people because we're

00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:04,369
trying to do something different very

00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:07,040
very very helpful so what does that

00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:09,529
imply snap craft example of what clubs

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,809
should do I reckon they should

00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:13,790
concentrate on pre loading how do we get

00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:15,139
to the user out of there they should

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,910
improve that about poor outreach story

00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:18,679
they should collaborate with snap on the

00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:23,660
stuff where it makes sense like xdg

00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:27,829
portals and there's a little bit of a

00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:28,970
slide I need to move yeah they should

00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:30,769
work concentrate and improving

00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,269
overlapping tech because that's that

00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:35,540
area where it can improve both sides

00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:37,339
there's a weakness on on one and as a

00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:39,170
point of differentiation maintain that

00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:41,509
diversity of app sources because

00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:42,889
otherwise those literally would wouldn't

00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:44,509
exist I can assure you of that

00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:47,779
I was product manager and less when we

00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:49,160
selected the thing so coincidentally

00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:50,569
that's pretty much exactly what the

00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,569
flat-pack team and flat hub team are

00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:55,160
doing good news I hope so

00:12:53,569 --> 00:13:00,259
if you have other things that we should

00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:02,600
be doing - let's name so it moves from

00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:04,249
you know again how this gives us some

00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,679
strength to say no in an encouraging way

00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:08,600
so when we talk about things where

00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:10,999
you're like okay cool in the flat-pack

00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:14,709
world we could do this thing that will

00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:16,699
only work on one particular repository

00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:18,649
obviously that isn't gonna work because

00:13:16,699 --> 00:13:21,439
if we're doing things that only work on

00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:22,270
one particular repository like why does

00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:23,980
this thing even exist

00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:26,740
right it's it's it's completely against

00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:28,930
the raison d'être you know but at the

00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,210
same time you can say hey maybe we

00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:34,270
should go out there and try and work

00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:35,920
with other people and other applications

00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:38,260
and try and get work with upstreams to

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,730
better use portals because fundamentally

00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,260
there's lots and lots of different ways

00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,480
that people are going to do this thing

00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,950
and that's going to improve the user

00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,040
experience when people get their apps

00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:51,490
working in flat hub and in flat pack and

00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:54,340
in snap and in even app image if they

00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:59,530
have a work out way to put stuff inside

00:13:54,340 --> 00:14:02,740
a container but up until this point all

00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:06,460
we've done is use your brain okay same

00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:08,650
galaxy brain answer that isn't really

00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:10,720
the only way of collaborating with stuff

00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:13,600
and making great applications it's a

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,430
really good part we've found our we've

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,060
found you know our intrinsic motivation

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:20,490
earlier on we've now found sort of the

00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,480
the world that we're operating within

00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,570
now we need to talk a little bit more

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,610
about what feedback should we listen to

00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:30,760
very important how do we integrate that

00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:33,130
feedback in there but actually we need

00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,600
question zero how do we get feedback not

00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,070
watch we listen to because if you're

00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,160
listening on the wrong channel you're

00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:41,080
gonna get a lot of bad stuff where do we

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:48,070
get feedback do we get our feedback from

00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:52,780
fir onyx it's a source do we get our

00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:56,020
feedback from Twitter you know I mean

00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:57,280
you know it's it's a strong response do

00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:00,040
we get our feedback from a series of

00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:02,650
cats as mostly where I get might be back

00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,930
from that provides the love and success

00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,730
that I need to keep going every day but

00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:08,560
some you know there are some good places

00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,060
we can go so we can get feedback in

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,280
person there are some really good

00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:14,200
examples earlier today of let's go and

00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,970
interview some people sounds good like a

00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,980
good idea let's talk to people at these

00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:19,270
kind of conferences again this was some

00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,780
really great collaboration that we've

00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:24,490
had and has corrected some stuff that we

00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,960
were going to do wrong that has given

00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:29,140
some ideas about things that we could do

00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:30,580
better in future gitlab it's a good at

00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,410
it's a good source I'm not gonna say

00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:35,020
that's a bug tracker isn't a good source

00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:36,140
of doing this thing this course IRC

00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,270
press review

00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,920
again people who are kind of interested

00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:43,279
in the area but dispassionate they've

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:46,160
probably got some good ideas blogs more

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:48,230
men fewer ideas but hold on okay forums

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,790
user testing again user testings really

00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,529
important you've got to recognize the

00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:53,330
strengths and weaknesses of user testing

00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:55,520
go know what you're trying to get out of

00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:58,220
it the kind of context the person coming

00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,630
into it has apps is a little bit

00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,980
different if you're working on desktops

00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:03,110
that's something that people use pretty

00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:05,660
much every day the whole time so they

00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:07,880
might be more willing to take a take

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,890
more of a training load on board for a

00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,410
more complicated application but again

00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:14,450
that's sort so similar to stuff like a

00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:15,920
nonlinear video editor where people do

00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,150
this for their job right you know like

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,850
this is something that they do every

00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:22,010
single day versus a to-do list thing

00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:24,860
where there are 200 of them and you can

00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:30,470
switch it kind of if it's in any way

00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:31,820
annoying it's gonna go so great products

00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,620
never listen in just one way I think

00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:37,010
that's the important really important

00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:41,029
message but big difference between kind

00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:43,430
of companies like Apple who have a very

00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:46,160
strong intrinsic drive and spend a lot

00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:48,020
of their time listening to themselves

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,300
and to user testing and to do all that

00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:53,570
stuff and companies like say Facebook

00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,980
who are incredibly metrics driven okay

00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:57,589
I'm not saying it should be one or the

00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,580
other but there are recognized what the

00:16:57,589 --> 00:16:59,959
strengths and weaknesses of your

00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,029
position are on different ways to listen

00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:05,809
and ways that you can get access to

00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:07,670
people or to feedback more easily so

00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:09,550
endless has metrics somewhat

00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:12,230
controversial but they're really good

00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:14,059
you know for a product manager they're

00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,199
good I can tell you that Nautilus is the

00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:17,300
number one most use game application

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,480
it's probably won't surprise you too

00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:22,130
much file managers are kind of a useful

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,709
thing but it surprised me the first time

00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:26,740
I saw it because I thought that our

00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:29,990
users didn't really use files that way I

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:32,390
learned something different you can also

00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:34,700
using these kind of metrics instrument

00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:36,290
actions within your application so you

00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,480
can say you know if there's something

00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:39,530
that you're trying to test some new some

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,420
new stuff you can find that out

00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:43,460
obviously you need to make sure that

00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,740
that this is done in a

00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:48,010
privacy-preserving fashion not least

00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:51,910
because it's literally the law

00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:53,320
but but also because it's trust it's

00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,669
very important this can tell you

00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,070
something really important I would

00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:58,600
strongly recommend if you work with a

00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:01,870
large enough organization that you can

00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,700
afford to set up the infrastructure you

00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:06,130
need and that you can deal with the

00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:09,220
regulation regulatory burden make that

00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:12,960
happen for you or get metrics like

00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:15,190
information in some way or another but

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,100
all this is telling you is the what I

00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:19,510
can tell you not service is opened loads

00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,610
and loads of times I can tell you it's

00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:23,260
open for a very long time doesn't tell

00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:27,040
me why doesn't tell me anything about

00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:29,290
the way I can know all kinds of stuff

00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:32,290
about cool this button is clicked on

00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:34,559
four thousand times great the one next

00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:37,450
to it is clicked on two hundred times

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,820
maybe great maybe not maybe one of them

00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:41,440
is closed application and I don't want

00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,429
actually anyone to anyone to click that

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,940
button I wanted to keep it open the

00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:47,679
whole time I'm not sure that's why you

00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,480
know if you just take metrics on their

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,860
own if you just take user feedback on it

00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,840
same you're not really getting anything

00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,320
you need to integrate that whole picture

00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,040
together

00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,419
use your judgment little bit more so one

00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,090
of the reasons why you're gonna need to

00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:02,140
do some of this stuff is because I would

00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:04,179
strongly encourage you to

00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:06,490
disintermediate and get access to the

00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:08,200
user as much as you possibly can use

00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:10,630
something like snap user like flat-pack

00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,490
user like app image I mean fundamentally

00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:15,490
go rounds at the user's computer and put

00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:17,500
it on there yourself if you're trying to

00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:19,299
do this trying to work out this kind of

00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,790
thing here the why that means you're

00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:24,780
gonna be it erasing as I think Alex said

00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:28,390
earlier on if your iteration cycle is

00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:31,690
you know at the speed of a distribution

00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:33,130
release cycle you know that's not

00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:35,169
helping I want to get I want to get

00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,549
three releases out in a week I want

00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:37,929
these people to be upgraded I want to be

00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:39,910
able to see stuff and we'll see how this

00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:41,890
works you know you can't afford to be

00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:48,040
held back by the slowest possible

00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:49,450
application yeah also like control your

00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,820
own stuff it's easier to get bug reports

00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:55,940
you know there's different talks events

00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:57,680
so we found all of this feedback we've

00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:02,780
written all down we've thrown half of it

00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:04,820
in the bin those were actually the

00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:06,770
designs for that thing I saw it I showed

00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:10,670
you earlier in retrospect I realized

00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:15,410
that now and what are you gonna do with

00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:16,850
it so you are gonna what you need to do

00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:18,980
is you need to write that down yourself

00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:20,390
I can't really help you about insulating

00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,810
that stuff that is kind of literally

00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:25,490
what product managers do and it depends

00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:27,260
completely differently on each situation

00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:29,720
that you're in but you need to weigh all

00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,640
of these bits of feedback separately you

00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,960
need to compare them against where the

00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,970
potential strengths and weaknesses you

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,560
have in the market what opportunities do

00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:39,260
you have to satisfy that customer better

00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,990
that you've you've created or the market

00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:44,030
you've you've done or maybe even just

00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:46,430
looking at it you're going actually you

00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:48,110
know what success for me is just making

00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:50,300
this thing for myself that it's

00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:51,860
perfectly valid that is the story that

00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,630
you're telling you've integrated all of

00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:56,030
the feedback there and the standards you

00:20:53,630 --> 00:21:00,970
only have to maintain it yourself you

00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:00,970
know it's it's true

00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:11,859
so very important here at the starter

00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:14,679
this at the side of this you started off

00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:17,139
with no plan no clue or potentially no

00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:19,419
plan and a clue I'm assuming that you

00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:21,489
know one of these two things by the

00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:23,440
inflammation implementation of product

00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:26,950
fairy dust the intention is to move

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,299
further up either the top left I can't

00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,269
help provide you with clue I'm afraid

00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:33,309
that's that's kind of a your own job or

00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:36,339
to plan and clue which is the dangerous

00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:38,919
area and this is area that's one of the

00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:42,639
senior members at Intel told us about I

00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:43,629
was particularly enjoying you'll notice

00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:45,639
and all of these things that basically

00:21:43,629 --> 00:21:48,459
I've just been telling you about how to

00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:50,709
deal with the first problem here and not

00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:52,320
really talk too much about the second

00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:54,909
two options this is kind of dilib rep

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,109
I've quite enjoyed my time at this

00:21:54,909 --> 00:21:59,379
conference I'd like to come back and

00:21:56,109 --> 00:22:05,079
give further talks so consider this is a

00:21:59,379 --> 00:22:08,979
trailer yeah consider this as your

00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:11,440
watchword aim for plan and clue so

00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:14,200
summing up them every single person is

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,769
making a product I mean basically

00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,969
everyone here is you can get more

00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:20,649
deliberate about making that product

00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:23,259
whether you like it or not you're doing

00:22:20,649 --> 00:22:25,239
all of this work already but just think

00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:28,499
a little bit about it it's not very hard

00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:31,539
you know we just did it in 25 minutes I

00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:32,950
can do it for you until I have to get on

00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:35,109
a plane later today if you buy me a

00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:38,139
drink and we could have a talk about it

00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:41,619
afterwards or later we can we have lots

00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:44,559
of different conversations get a

00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:45,849
diversity of feedback products are

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,719
better when them when they're made by

00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:50,679
more diverse viewpoints whilst it's

00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:53,979
really really important to have that

00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:55,209
strong vision moderating that is where

00:22:53,979 --> 00:22:58,599
it turns into a kind of a superpower

00:22:55,209 --> 00:23:00,849
okay so it's it's not about moving

00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:02,499
around and being just swayed by whatever

00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:05,200
the last person on Bugzilla told you to

00:23:02,499 --> 00:23:07,799
do it's about combining those two things

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,849
together and that needs some discernment

00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:12,609
yeah so you need to be discerning of

00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:15,009
what is sensible feedback what is within

00:23:12,609 --> 00:23:16,990
your story where you should just go hey

00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:18,550
this sounds like you

00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,530
should actually use this product over

00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:22,510
here you should use that thing over

00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,950
there like if you're trying to make

00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,330
something that you really believe in you

00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:27,490
shouldn't be scared of someone else

00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:30,130
using something else there's significant

00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:31,150
billions of humans in the world and you

00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:33,850
do not need all of them to use your

00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:35,860
stuff you are not Apple or Google I can

00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:55,870
guarantee that I've seen the attendee

00:23:35,860 --> 00:24:02,260
list to collapse I thought my voice how

00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:06,610
about well actually no yes question from

00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:10,600
the back I like it Leyna gentleman

00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:13,390
ocular maintainer so do mention saying

00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:15,850
no positively but that's that's one of

00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:17,950
the biggest issues I have right it's

00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:21,280
like yeah when people propose something

00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:24,130
there they propose it because they need

00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,600
it and and sometimes they think nobody

00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:27,040
that house has thought about that before

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,210
and it's like in DES mind is like the

00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:33,429
most brilliant idea anybody has ever had

00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:35,200
so it's kind of I personally have a lot

00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:37,380
of problems shutting shooting down

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,480
people saying okay you know like maybe

00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:42,910
that's not so really good idea so right

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,340
and also like kind of if you're

00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:46,870
particularly nice about it which I know

00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,730
everyone in this room will definitely

00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:50,440
try to be it can be a real drain on your

00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:52,360
time to kind of recapitulate the last

00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,090
twenty years worth of product decisions

00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,350
you've had to make about the why or why

00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:58,929
not you're doing this if you're trying

00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:02,080
to say no in a nice way yes it's really

00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:04,360
difficult I think one of the one of the

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,020
things that I it depends on the

00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,340
situation

00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:08,740
sometimes you just have to say no

00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:12,270
seriously you're being a person who is

00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:15,970
violating the code of conduct but I

00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:18,970
think one of the things there is think

00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:20,950
about think from try and help that

00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:24,670
person think from another person's point

00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:27,280
of view so if they're saying yes I need

00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:29,410
this help them to think okay how many

00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,640
other people need this what changes need

00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:32,110
to be made to this kind

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,500
you want to make an order for it to be

00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:37,150
valid how are you the person who is

00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:39,340
contributing this thing can a defray my

00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:41,140
maintenance time how are we going to

00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,970
help work together to make sure that

00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,700
this is bug free is there an extra

00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:48,090
testing you can help me with in order to

00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:50,500
get this it's about you know trying to

00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:53,770
trying to create empathy for them for

00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:55,660
you and for the for the end-user because

00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:56,920
a lot of the time those people haven't

00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,890
they definitely haven't spent all that

00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:01,990
time thinking about it but yeah it's

00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:03,610
it's the hard thing right this is why

00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:06,610
people are paid to be product managers

00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:07,600
and don't don't just you know do it out

00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:09,810
the goodness of their own hearts all the

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,810
time

00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:39,399
I'm looking forward to the gift thank

00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:39,399
you this is for you give him a big hand

00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:44,840
[Applause]

00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:53,720
okay we are a few minutes away from

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,929
starting our lightning talks please be

00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,929
here

00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:31,120
how does how does the metrics demon work

00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:33,460
this is very exciting

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,660
anyone does currently or formerly work

00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,840
at endless to see whether I can remember

00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:39,910
it's an open source demon that so

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,330
basically stuff sends d-bus messages

00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:45,730
when things happen to a to a metrics

00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:47,650
collector which runs locally compresses

00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:49,750
stuff adds jitter does a bunch of

00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:51,810
different things to premise we preserve

00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:53,920
it links it against the machine ID

00:28:51,810 --> 00:29:00,940
periodically that then gets uploaded to

00:28:53,920 --> 00:29:03,010
a metric service in tech cloud and yeah

00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,420
there's there's ways of doing back off

00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:06,760
and compression and all that kind of

00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:08,560
stuff but sir he adds very very limited

00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,810
amount of bandwidth usage almost no

00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,940
memory and it's just in kind of data

00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:17,400
points of like you know this particular

00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:20,230
metric here happened this time so for

00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:22,210
for application usage for example so

00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:25,900
length of thing you know when it started

00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:28,000
and when it stopped you know there's

00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:30,490
some similar stuff for a bunch of things

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,690
but you can see all of those metrics

00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:37,960
trace points in in endless gap or talk

00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:40,650
to rob who I think has probably come to

00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,880
the plane right now but but yeah it's

00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:45,430
but yeah yeah yeah it's it's all it's

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,020
all open source stuff and any

00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:49,120
application can do it obviously if the

00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:51,040
collect if flexor isn't there nothing

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,360
will happen the thing went back when I

00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,280
worked at unless they would always tell

00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,570
people was if you want to see if you're

00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,520
an application developer and want to see

00:29:55,570 --> 00:30:00,550
your metrics come talk to us and we'll

00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:02,590
we'll make it happen for you obviously

00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:04,240
the ones that were actually instrumented

00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:06,430
with like click metrics and stuff rule

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,480
endless applications themselves cuz we

00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:10,090
were trying to work out you know

00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,490
in the encyclopedia did people search

00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:14,140
that they browse how long did they spend

00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:16,570
on things do they click on links inside

00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:19,270
their you know what did they always come

00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:24,550
in by using the global search yes the

00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:26,800
answer is um so during the cheering game

00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:28,990
initial sets up there's a screen about

00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:32,320
do you want to do you want to allow our

00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:33,970
metrics yes or no default though as

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,180
default yes in some countries but

00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:43,870
yeah was there pushback of contention

00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:46,810
it was never controversial no no no

00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:48,880
because because Angeles was not angeles

00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:50,380
was not targeting and is not targeting

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,030
the traditional desktop environment like

00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:54,310
is it doesn't consider itself to be a

00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:56,680
competitor really to like you know

00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:58,270
endless users don't even know what the

00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,790
hell a bunch who is learn anything else

00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:04,330
the other systems they use like android

00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:07,240
iOS windows all have these things things

00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:09,160
in but no i'm sorry it's the first

00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,810
you've heard of it i did a very bad job

00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:17,560
of explaining it previously it's pretty

00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:21,880
cool yeah yeah they would freak the hell

00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:25,660
out yes they would they would her the

00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:27,640
installer stuff yeah yeah right exactly

00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:29,020
yeah and like for example they're

00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:33,160
they're super happy to do the steam

00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:36,310
hardware survey you know it's it's one

00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:40,170
of those where like it's it's it's where

00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:43,290
you sit in the sort of that trust clue a

00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:45,910
privacy preserving person continuum and

00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:47,950
it was more controversial for engineers

00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:50,680
inside endless than it was for endless

00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:57,210
users but week you can turn it off I

00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:57,210
turned off you know works yeah

00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:07,799
a product zone it doesn't have to be a

00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:13,279
product manager it can just be like an

00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:13,279
experts in the area so like imagine a

00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:21,210
imagine you're making a like industrial

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,710
controls machinery so the product owner

00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:24,150
is that someone is the person who runs

00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:26,669
that machine and they are telling you

00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:28,710
the programmer or someone else like yes

00:32:26,669 --> 00:32:30,029
this is good or not' bad a product

00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:32,789
manager is kind of basically like a

00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:35,610
generalist superstar who doesn't have

00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:37,200
specific knowledge of that area you can

00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:41,130
take the role of a product owner in a

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:43,110
scrum team and almost always you do but

00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:46,350
you are actually you kind of have more

00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:48,500
of a kind of an oversight area does that

00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,500
help

00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:57,490
right right right yeah they I mean kind

00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:01,630
of the thing that I would say is

00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:03,639
basically like you can you can do one or

00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:06,399
two of the really deep skills within any

00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:08,679
software team well and you can fake the

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,090
rest of them and kind of fill in where

00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:13,570
necessary so you can call people on

00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:15,429
 and generally generally kind of

00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:17,620
like you can do any of that stuff that's

00:33:15,429 --> 00:33:22,090
kind of the ideal Swiss Army knife kind

00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:23,649
of if there is it's it's different at

00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:27,539
different projects it's different in

00:33:23,649 --> 00:33:27,539
