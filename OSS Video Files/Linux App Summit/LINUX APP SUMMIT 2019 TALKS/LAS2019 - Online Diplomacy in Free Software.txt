and I don't have the slices as it was

00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:08,309
something very spontaneous so today I

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:10,200
will be talking about something

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:13,380
different and I'm like today like I'm

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,660
the student of the diplomacy and

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,270
international affairs as I was four

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,310
years ago so this is my visual er degree

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,670
as well so I'll be talking about the

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,470
online diplomacy and free software and

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,849
right now I was remembering the time

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,840
that I was presenting in front of my

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:32,009
professors and they got very suspicious

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,469
when I said that we can actually

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,780
integrate diplomacy with something

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,059
online as they thought that nothing is

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,610
safe when it's online and that the

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:44,820
diplomats and every deal that they would

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:47,190
have would go open and public in the

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,770
beginning I didn't know what to do as

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,309
for my diploma thesis many students

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:56,430
started to choose subjects like the

00:00:52,309 --> 00:01:01,739
Middle East Wars or the Soviet Union's

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:04,080
like from 1945 until 1990 countries

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:06,150
during the communist systems so I

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,060
thought why not to do something

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:11,220
different and then I opened the news in

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,040
the national television and I heard the

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,979
news that Albania closed the embassy in

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:20,070
Norway because we couldn't find the

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:23,520
money to keep it the rent was so

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:26,369
expensive and the budget of the embassy

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,290
couldn't afford it the everything was

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:31,140
expensive like the accommodation and

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,390
everything so I thought that probably we

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,229
can do something online also to replace

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,520
the embassies or to or to replace all

00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:41,070
the things that can be actually online

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,320
and not to be needed like to go

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:47,189
somewhere and to have it so by having

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,659
the online diplomacy or by having things

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:50,549
that are the meetings that can happen

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,820
online and stuff like this it can be

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:56,700
easier regarding the budget flew people

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:59,490
to fraud to fly around the world less

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,820
money to be spent and it will be way

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,560
easier for everyone's life so this was

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,570
in the Albanian aspect and this is what

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,479
kind of I treated in my diploma and

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,790
during that time I remember that it went

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,680
to being an initiative that actually was

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,599
also big in Kosovo

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,629
when a group of people and students

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,510
started to send requests to link at the

00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:25,110
in Facebook and all other system to put

00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:27,840
Kosovo as a name listed in their country

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,849
system so it was a very big initiative

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,180
and I thought that it is really cool as

00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:36,000
a as a very good step on actually to do

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,409
the diplomacy because diplomacy cannot

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,239
be done only by people that are

00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:41,280
diplomats that have thirty year

00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,260
experiences and they know very well what

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,329
to do but diplomacy is something that

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,819
can be done by everyone even by the

00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:50,310
students by those that think that they

00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:52,769
do not belong here but negotiations and

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,170
talking and communication can help us

00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:57,870
solve everything and also have a better

00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,890
place to live in so this was my thank

00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:04,220
you

00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:04,220
