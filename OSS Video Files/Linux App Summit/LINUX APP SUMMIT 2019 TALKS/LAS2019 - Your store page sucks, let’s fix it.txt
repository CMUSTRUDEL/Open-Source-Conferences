really loud awesome alright so put it

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:13,320
together again for Alan and we'll let

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,059
him speak okay start the clock my name

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,930
is Alan Pope I'm a developer advocate I

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:21,630
work at canonical on Ubuntu and snap

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:26,250
craft and my talk is titled your store

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:32,060
page sucks let's fix it so why is this

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:32,060
clicker not working oh man

00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:43,050
use the mouse so it snaps our software

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,570
packages for Linux we have a beautiful

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,340
web-based front-end that allows the

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,289
people to see the snaps that are in the

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,410
snap store you can visit the snap store

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:55,219
right now get a snap craft io and click

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:58,739
the store button at the top of the page

00:00:55,219 --> 00:01:02,430
this for example is the slow page for

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:04,519
Microsoft Visio code party desktop

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,710
application available in the snap store

00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:10,140
published by Microsoft these pages look

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:13,680
awesome on desktops and on mobile

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,570
browsers as well if you scroll down on

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,610
the page you see more detail the

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,590
description of the application well it

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,540
does why you might want to install it it

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,369
links to the upstream developers website

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,890
where prospective users can find out

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:28,380
more the correct link goes sorry the

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,579
contact link goes to a Twitter account

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,439
where you can interact with the

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:33,210
developers and there's also accurate

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,250
license data over on the right hand side

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,460
and the application has been updated

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:41,220
recently your reaction might be wait I

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,680
have a store page and the answer is yes

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,220
if you publish a snap in the snap store

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,479
you automatically get a store page

00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:50,610
here's another example of a great store

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,009
page it's difficult to tell because

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,890
there's a lot of black here it's an

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:58,140
application called XD it's correctly

00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,790
cased at the top it's in multiple

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,430
categories that makes it easy for users

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,860
to find it you can embed a video in this

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,600
case it's an ASCII cinema because it's a

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,119
command line application and you can

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,229
have multiple screenshots we'll cut them

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,150
some slack here because this is a

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,370
terminal based application which is why

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,110
it's all black

00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,120
well that looks great as a rich

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,730
description with lots of information and

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,860
diss links to where you can find out

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,540
more information and again it's been

00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,230
updated recently and the license is

00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,299
correct

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:30,599
more markdown if you keep scrolling

00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:32,069
there's even more information maybe it

00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,780
details about what you could do post

00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:36,780
install links to more documentation

00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:39,420
develop a website github account all

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,730
kinds of stuff and also if we blog about

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,129
it on the Ubuntu blog they get embedded

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,810
here as well so we can help promote your

00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:48,180
application if you put it in the snap

00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,970
store and those blogs get cross-linked

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,190
in the store page why should I care

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,410
about this you might be thinking surely

00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,390
people won't visit these pages this is

00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:00,180
not how people discover applications on

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:04,019
Linux and the answer is you're wrong

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:07,410
they do people find these pages through

00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:10,349
organic search in some cases the snap

00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,090
craft page appears before the official

00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:14,220
installation documentation zin the

00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,700
Google rang so people do find these

00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,980
pages and they do click on them and here

00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,049
is an example of the metrics that you

00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,120
might get access to if you publish it

00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:26,639
snap in the store having a good store

00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,889
page gives users confidence that they

00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,810
can install your application more users

00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:34,290
will install an application with a

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:36,500
decent store page this is the metrics

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:39,720
for the new image manipulation program

00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:42,030
also known as if you have a nice

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,160
store page it will drive more users to

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,169
install your application I guarantee if

00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:50,430
you have a prettier page you'll get more

00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:52,109
installs than if you don't so what do I

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,450
need to do well if you've uploaded

00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:56,819
something to the snap store visit your

00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,680
page and put yourself in the shoes of an

00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:00,329
alien who's never seen your application

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,180
before and let's take a couple of

00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:06,840
terrible examples here's a terrible snap

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:09,840
store page no pictures the application

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,129
name is incorrectly cased I'm not sure

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,889
that license is right but the last

00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:16,049
updated date is wrong there's not a rich

00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:18,120
description it's a terrible example of a

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:22,320
store page nobody would want to install

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,840
this thing in fact the contact canonical

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,139
link at the bottom goes to a mailing

00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,509
list

00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:32,090
like who wants to go to a mailing list

00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:34,669
tell send your people to discourse or

00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:37,610
slack or rocket chat or IRC or MySpace

00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:39,379
or wherever you hang out and don't send

00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,569
people to dust email and mailing lists

00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,310
because then they end up sending you

00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:45,620
strange emails to your mailing list

00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:48,379
that's a terrible thing to expect people

00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,870
to do thank you for listening

00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:52,610
make your store page look nice people

00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,590
will visit it and I guarantee you'll get

00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,870
more installs for more information you

00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:59,210
can do a Bing search for make your store

00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,219
page pop and my colleague Heather is

00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,900
giving a talk tomorrow about more of

00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:05,150
this stuff and you can hear more then

00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,280
also come downstairs and grab a free tea

00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,940
