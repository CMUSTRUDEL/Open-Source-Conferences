Thanks

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,970
I have a little video to show you I

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,610
don't know if this will work which I

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,700
don't know if it's rigged for sound but

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:19,560
I'm going to put microphone down on the

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:21,240
speaker see if you can wait okay so if

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,510
it doesn't work I'll just talk you

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,510
through it

00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,060
Oh

00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:37,920
so I have to

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,050
what button was it to mirror there

00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:55,920
huh

00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:05,760
yes what what do i press window okay

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,230
okay okay so

00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,460
let's see if this works leave notes

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:39,900
can you hear it one second maybe put the

00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,900
volume

00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:47,609
this happens because I'm too ambitious

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:58,859
okay that's a miler the thing is so I

00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:03,710
recorded yes I'm sorry I recorded a

00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:07,740
series of people and I asked them about

00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:11,280
typical vocabulary that we use in when

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:17,580
we talk about that software so I asked

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:20,430
them what they thought Windows was right

00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,470
and some people said it's an operating

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,410
system but I mean these are people

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:29,390
outside completely out bubble there are

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:34,380
all sorts of people I talked to from

00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:36,630
people that work cleaning to students to

00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:40,860
university professors all sorts of

00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:42,780
people but that are not related to the

00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,760
free software world the only thing they

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,579
had in common is that they used

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:51,599
computers from time to time right like

00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:56,190
most people in in the developed world

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,269
and I asked them for about for example

00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,880
what they thought the desktop

00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:01,650
environment was and most of the answers

00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:06,109
was it's the table where I have my

00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:10,760
laptop I asked them what they thought

00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:13,920
Linux was and most people didn't know

00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:17,220
one person said it was programming

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,690
language and another person didn't know

00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,540
because they had used it at school

00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:25,290
because well I'm from Spain and in some

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:28,349
schools in Spain they have Linux I asked

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,299
them if they knew what KD was no idea I

00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:32,310
asked them if they knew what no was is

00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:35,690
the thing I have in my garden that was

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:38,669
from a British person right there I

00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:40,620
asked them what they thought plasma was

00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:46,019
and the general answer to that was oh

00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:53,099
that's a big TV right so now I I did

00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:57,690
this I tried to do this in an empathetic

00:03:53,099 --> 00:04:01,739
way I was not out to prove that they

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:04,590
were ignorant I was out to prove that

00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:09,660
there is a divide between what we

00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:13,800
to people and I mean and which we use to

00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:18,000
talk to people and the language they use

00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:22,790
and they understand us so this is about

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,790
that so it is that

00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,590
so I'm going to start

00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:44,400
we're going to learn by example here of

00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:48,510
the problems that we have when talking

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:51,000
to our users so if I if I show I'm going

00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:53,340
to show I'm going to I'm going to show

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,640
initially some websites of projects real

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:59,580
projects that exist if you develop any

00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:02,040
of those projects I am NOT out to offend

00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,900
you or to shame you or anything like

00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,000
that right I'm just good and just trying

00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,190
to show some things that are lacking and

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,780
see what we can learn from that and how

00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:14,820
we can improve so my first thing is I

00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,250
looked at the series of website linear

00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:21,570
theory of projects of websites and how

00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:23,850
they described their projects the the

00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:30,840
the projects themselves okay so I went

00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:32,670
to oka and well Orca is an excellent

00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:36,950
project I think we'll all agree I mean

00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:42,060
it's it's a brilliant way of making

00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:44,910
desktops accessible to people who have

00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,910
problems maybe we're with site or

00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:51,110
whatever and there's absolutely this

00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:53,460
this you get to this website going to no

00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:56,550
application list of applications and

00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:58,110
then scrolling down to Orca and it turns

00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,780
out there is no description on this

00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,850
website so the first thing that we can

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,010
learn from this website is that wow you

00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:07,920
know at least you have to describe the

00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:10,170
thing your your your your your Hawking

00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,720
and in this case there is no description

00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:16,130
at all right it's that's directly with

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:21,570
documentation another one

00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:23,970
this is kdenlive it's a video again no

00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:26,640
description at all of what this is even

00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:29,070
more so they put up an image but the

00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:32,190
image is incomplete so we can't deduce

00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:36,090
from the image what what what this this

00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:38,160
application does I thought okay maybe if

00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:42,930
I go to the about I will get the

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:45,480
description of what it is nope I get KD

00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:48,570
lives in acronym for KD non-linear video

00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:52,020
editor doesn't say what KD life is it

00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:53,699
says where the word comes from

00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:57,120
and then it goes on to describe

00:06:53,699 --> 00:07:01,969
nonlinear video editing and it doesn't

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,969
it never gets to what came in life is

00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:08,129
this one is a bit better we're going

00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,409
we're going from from sort of like not

00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:18,030
descriptive at all so no description to

00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:19,770
going up a bit but again would you would

00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:24,139
you be tempted to download this with

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:27,780
just that description really any of you

00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:30,210
look I mean apparently it's a really fun

00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:33,930
there's a really fun game right I looked

00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:36,330
into it I did it I you have to dance and

00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:39,690
things I don't do that but for people

00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:44,629
who do you know but and that's it that

00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:44,629
that's the website that's yeah you know

00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:50,129
but it's a step better than the or

00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:53,250
Kincaid in life because at least there's

00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:56,669
a description of what it is right now

00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:59,099
we're going to go a bit further and much

00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:02,569
more this is the original description of

00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:07,099
kiddie gamete do you know what this is

00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:11,250
the KD people will know of course well

00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:13,830
so and you most of you here would say

00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:17,250
what's wrong with that that's perfectly

00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:20,099
intelligible okay

00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,080
I've said I said this in another chat so

00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:26,009
if you've heard it before

00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:30,050
okay if we look at that the first word

00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:35,219
is the name of the of the software

00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:38,190
lightweight is a buzz word user

00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:40,860
interfaces jargon framework is jargon

00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:44,070
Mobile is jargon convergent is a

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:50,760
buzzword and jargon applications is

00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:56,790
jargon of that sentence the words that

00:08:50,760 --> 00:09:00,450
are common English are is a four and and

00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,170
everything else for somebody who is not

00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:05,850
you

00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:09,390
it's gobbledygook now the nice thing of

00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:13,530
this is I said this in in one of the

00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:16,110
academies and the developers took issue

00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:19,230
but then they went and did something

00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:20,790
about it and he did something that I am

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,010
personally quite proud that they did I

00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:28,410
think they did a really good job and

00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:33,380
they did this so now this is still

00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:36,930
saying the same thing but it is

00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:41,850
understandable by everybody so if you're

00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:44,520
a manager who is not a developer and you

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,380
land on this site through a Google

00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:50,880
search or something you know we need

00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:52,440
something to for they can look and say

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,480
hey and they can tell developers hey

00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,730
look at this and they can just press get

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,960
started and the developers can then get

00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:02,130
into the really technical stuff but this

00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:06,030
everybody can understand what this is

00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:09,060
that is basically what kirigami is no

00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:10,650
better it is what kiddie game is for and

00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,650
this is probably the first lesson you

00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:17,280
can learn from this presentation I mean

00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:19,920
all the rest has been rubbish but the

00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:24,180
first thing you can learn is that when

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:29,550
you want to describe your application or

00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:33,500
your software it may be a good idea to

00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:34,710
not say what it is but what it is for

00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,630
okay

00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,650
later I have some slides with rules

00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,510
they're not really rules they're

00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:42,840
guidelines so just think about that

00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:49,200
think of what it is used for think of

00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:55,020
term in terms of Jo this imaginary user

00:10:49,200 --> 00:11:00,680
and what he or she would understand okay

00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:04,410
how it improves her or his life right

00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:07,950
later we will break down in what ways

00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:09,810
things improve now the thing is that

00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,050
this is not only for websites but when

00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:15,209
you

00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:17,490
go to market your applications and your

00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:21,089
projects on social media the same thing

00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:23,940
applies the same rules apply here we

00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:25,950
have this is a post from reddit for

00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,260
Katie in life again sorry if anybody

00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:33,470
from Katie life is here not picking on

00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:37,170
you but they so they they've released

00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:40,260
18.04 one and it posted this on ready

00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:44,519
got decent traction this is from Arlene

00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:45,560
oats got 83 up votes and two coins by

00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,350
mistake

00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:54,660
the Cady promo team published the same

00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:56,640
news an hour later on our Linux now what

00:11:54,660 --> 00:12:00,240
the protein did is they made it much

00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:02,760
more explicit they said what they gave a

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:07,800
kind of story and background to it okay

00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:11,310
now the same subreddit our Linux same

00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:15,839
day one hour difference this one came in

00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:18,930
later so it got 183 up votes and 20

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:22,140
comments so this is the second lesson

00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:28,620
you have to be explicit about your stuff

00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:31,589
just don't say a is B say a is B or a is

00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:34,980
used for B and for C and for D etc

00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:37,920
cetera okay and when you do a release

00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,779
announcement okay some people will say

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,029
that is title Gore have you heard of

00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:44,310
that concept title war you know writing

00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:45,870
something that is so long that is not a

00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:49,350
headline anymore it's nearly a whole

00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:54,899
article in a head like well okay but the

00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:58,410
title Gore works as you can see now we

00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:04,740
have enough run from last year's

00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:06,300
linguist application summit so the

00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,990
organizers here published this tweet

00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:14,910
right this was published on the 31st of

00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:19,649
August and in khaidi

00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:23,010
we published this one it's a couple of

00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:29,100
five days later I think right

00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:33,150
and if you look so we retweeted this in

00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:36,590
KD and got 5 retweets in total and 10

00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:39,270
likes but then we did the same we did

00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:42,980
talking about the same thing and we were

00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:46,800
25 or tweets and 58 lights

00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:50,580
why why was this so much more popular

00:13:46,800 --> 00:14:02,160
than the original tweet anybody want to

00:13:50,580 --> 00:14:05,130
guess but whatever pattern there's a

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:11,360
photo ok there's a picture yes that

00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:15,000
helped a lot more since what the talk is

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,680
ok there is also the element that's like

00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,650
you know cheeky element of turning it

00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:23,550
into story it's a road trip it sounds

00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:25,410
it's kind of zani you know so that is

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:28,040
probably the third lesson you can learn

00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:31,890
that you have to turn it into a story

00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:36,750
right a story that your users can relate

00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:40,620
to and there we have some of the rules

00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:46,110
that come out from from what I just

00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:50,100
explained so first again rules not the

00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:54,120
word guidelines ok these are all subject

00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:57,060
to what is appropriate in each moment

00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,310
and what style your your your your

00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:01,890
audience is used to who you're talking

00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:07,130
to etcetera cetera but in general you

00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:11,160
have to be more explicit than not right

00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:15,630
don't really bother with what it is say

00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:20,630
what is used for right

00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:24,750
part of number one is list the benefits

00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:26,610
in your title this is all the features

00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,500
or the changes if it's a if it's a

00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:31,680
release announcement say what has

00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:36,200
changed but always in function of what

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:40,770
the more general user can understand

00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:43,200
make a story out of it and related to

00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:45,660
the bhavish think of Joe think of Joe is

00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:49,020
you make a story of it that Joe can

00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:51,720
identify with what does this mean you

00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:55,560
say for example okay we have released a

00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:58,920
new version of X software right and now

00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:04,080
you thanks to this new release can do

00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:07,680
this and this and this that is making a

00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:11,490
story for Joe she imagines herself in

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,320
that situation using that software and

00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:17,120
thinking of all the new things you can

00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:21,240
do or the bug that has thought that that

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:26,990
you have solved that now helps her get

00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,990
her job done right

00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:37,959
so those are my five rules there are

00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:43,209
also more rules coming from much more

00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:47,749
prestigious sources George Orwell's

00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:48,829
rules for writing well maybe you have

00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:52,749
seen these before

00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:59,119
as in hands up who has seen these before

00:16:52,749 --> 00:17:00,799
good so George always he has a an essay

00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:04,419
called Pollux politics in the English

00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:08,209
language where he analyzes how people

00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:10,519
write and he finds all the mistakes that

00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:15,260
they make and he summarizes them into

00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:18,199
these six rules so never use a metaphor

00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:20,839
and all those six rules those rules are

00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:24,909
good for everything but we can also

00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:27,769
break them down to make them even more

00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:30,350
appropriate for what we are doing here

00:17:27,769 --> 00:17:35,799
no so when he says never use a metaphor

00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:40,370
I would say never use a metaphor simile

00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:43,190
period why because if you're trying to

00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:47,090
explain something by using a metaphor

00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:48,830
you're adding another layer above what

00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:51,529
you're trying to explain that just

00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:54,769
complicates it more if you say hmmm my

00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:58,070
software is like a car or my software is

00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:59,630
like a house or my software at some

00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:01,610
point first your metaphor is going to

00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:06,409
break down because obviously it's not a

00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:09,230
car is not a house and secondly now the

00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:12,080
reader has to kind of see where you're

00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:15,019
going with this with this car know if

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:18,110
you just explain what the advantages are

00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:20,450
and how they can use them and how the

00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:23,779
changes are going to change how they use

00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:25,909
the software that's it if you've done it

00:18:23,779 --> 00:18:26,440
right they won't need any metaphors at

00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:29,360
all

00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:32,360
so every time you attempt it in a blog

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,549
post for example to use a metaphor don't

00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,500
it's mean you're not explaining

00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:39,440
correctly what you're trying to say

00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,310
you're trying to add another layer of

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,170
abstraction

00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:49,270
right which does not help never use a

00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:56,720
long word we're short one will do or

00:18:49,270 --> 00:19:05,960
break it into small ones so we use for

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:08,600
example long words like application you

00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:14,900
know what you know what end users call

00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:16,730
what we call applications on phones we

00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:20,540
call them they call them that on phones

00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:22,460
on only on phones so what happens I

00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,890
asked that question was in the video I

00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,390
asked them okay what are these things

00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:28,400
you have on your phone you know your

00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:30,470
whatsapp app and you Instagram and all

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,640
that stuff and they say their apps okay

00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:37,190
and I said okay what are they what are

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,370
the similar things you have on your on

00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:42,380
your on your computer what do you think

00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:48,440
was the universal and everybody answer

00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:51,620
the same programs exactly programs so it

00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:57,140
is not long words versus short words

00:19:51,620 --> 00:20:00,320
it's long words versus versus simple

00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:02,120
words so applications the end users

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,980
don't use applications if you describe

00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:08,960
your your application as an application

00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:12,560
most people won't get it it's a program

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:15,350
I know this probably sounds terrible

00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:18,980
because you have been trying to shed

00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:20,870
this coil of programs for four years but

00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,630
that is the fact that is the language

00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:26,600
that the end users talk they use the

00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:31,310
word programs also a lot of people here

00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:33,880
are not English writers and often in

00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:36,380
your descriptions you tend to make

00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,120
long-running sentences that last whole

00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,010
paragraphs that you join together with

00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:43,910
which who and where and things like that

00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:46,850
don't do that the same the same we have

00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:48,950
that says about it breaking a big words

00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:50,630
into smaller ones break your big set

00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,390
your big sentences into smaller ones

00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:54,030
never use which to introduce a news

00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:57,810
cross

00:20:54,030 --> 00:21:03,960
what are you doing that's crazy just go

00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:09,900
this you know if when you say something

00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:13,410
like this program is a Papa bar which no

00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:18,780
four stop these and then continue

00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:25,550
describing right this especially is

00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:28,650
relevant to Germans for some reason okay

00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:30,180
if it is possible to cut out a word if

00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:31,740
it is possible to get a word out always

00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:35,700
cut it out okay

00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:37,140
so especially if the word is awesome you

00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,260
know sometimes to try and make it more

00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:42,720
familiar you use the word awesome the

00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:46,740
word awesome is definitely very uh norm

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,570
it is so overused it's so trite that you

00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,600
must ban it completely from your

00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:55,860
vocabulary other cases other words you

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:59,670
must you must cut out our words that do

00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:03,720
not help clarify what you're trying to

00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:05,670
say for example one of the going back to

00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,370
the video when people said oh desktop

00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:14,070
environment desktop environment is my

00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:17,760
table okay when I asked them what

00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:20,520
desktop environment was they said my

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:24,210
table when I asked them what a desktop

00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:28,350
was I don't said oh I see what you're

00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:30,870
getting at now they didn't really but

00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:34,740
they said I had the screen II saying the

00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:39,060
wallpaper where I have my icons so the

00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:41,180
word environment is not helping cut it

00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,180
out

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:48,000
going back to KD in life KD in life

00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:50,370
describes itself as a non-linear video

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,820
editor what do you think we can cut out

00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:59,400
from there well what what no linear I

00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:01,770
mean nobody does linear editing anymore

00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,690
that's getting a table celluloid cutting

00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:04,679
up with a scissor right and tailor it

00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:07,710
together with cellotape

00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:11,419
that is linear editing nobody does that

00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:15,179
so it's just a video editor cut out

00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:18,779
stuff that only confuses everything that

00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:22,679
doesn't actually carry any new meaning

00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:28,440
is noise what you want to do is have

00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:29,970
more signal and less noise never use the

00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,210
passive where you can use the active

00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:39,960
okay this goes beyond that and it says

00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:42,929
and it's sort of like you tend you I

00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:45,750
mean you this is the Royal you not you

00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:49,890
in particular but when you write stuff

00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:54,240
like press releases etc you tend to

00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:56,279
emulate a very stuffy way of writing or

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,500
when you try and explain something on

00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:01,950
your website you tend to be over for

00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:06,120
more and you try and sound like you're

00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:09,390
writing a PhD dissertation that is not a

00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:11,929
way that is friendly to an end user that

00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:15,000
is not going to entice them to use your

00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:16,950
your application where does this come

00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,370
from this comes from reading lots of

00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:23,820
press releases put out by people like

00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:25,380
Microsoft and Apple and IBM and you see

00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:29,010
oh they put out these really really

00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:30,830
stuffy press releases and they get

00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:35,669
people talking about them in the press

00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:37,080
well here's a here's a secret they get

00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:39,149
people talking about them in the press

00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:42,029
because people talk about them all the

00:24:39,149 --> 00:24:45,480
time it doesn't matter what they put out

00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:48,240
I mean they could put out a press

00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,450
release with a poop emoji and lots of

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:55,919
people will talk about it in the press

00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:58,350
now you are not them you have to ink if

00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:01,710
you want to engage the press or engage

00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:04,230
the users etc you have to know them the

00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:06,450
best way I have personally found is to

00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:09,240
actually have a personal rapport with

00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:11,190
with with with the the journalists or

00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,740
the person you're trying to talk to et

00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:15,750
cetera and find out what they're

00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:18,149
interested and make it personal

00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:20,159
now obviously if you're writing that on

00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:22,110
a website it is difficult because you

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,170
but then we can go back to

00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:27,780
those five rules the girl be explicit

00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:30,210
and think of a story blah blah and try

00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:37,530
and capture the bigger biggest audience

00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:41,820
possible never use technical jargon

00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:45,480
that's number five in always list of

00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:50,790
rules and the one where he says well

00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:53,730
never unless don't you know

00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:55,020
disregard is all these rules and less if

00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:57,690
you're going to say something barbarous

00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:59,580
this we can resume us unless you can't

00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:01,500
avoid it I mean if you have to write

00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:05,429
something that contravenes these rules

00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:10,919
as I say their guidelines do it but

00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:15,890
always think of your audience now to

00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:21,290
finish I want to I thought that maybe

00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:21,290
questions yes

00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:27,739
oh by the way sorry I wanted to mention

00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:29,749
if you can see Robins video her sees a

00:26:27,739 --> 00:26:31,789
great supplement of mine right because

00:26:29,749 --> 00:26:37,249
she talks about design and I'm only

00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:39,350
talking about words yes sorry again this

00:26:37,249 --> 00:26:41,899
is a super interesting and I'm

00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:46,509
interested in sort of looking at your

00:26:41,899 --> 00:26:48,679
sort of like user research script and

00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:51,470
how you go about doing that and maybe

00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:53,509
have you considered sort of putting it

00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:55,700
together as like a toolkit that other

00:26:53,509 --> 00:27:00,440
application developers can use as sort

00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:04,460
of run through similar studies so that

00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:08,389
they can bet their own applications and

00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:10,460
how they're okay I guess there's two two

00:27:08,389 --> 00:27:13,700
answers to that the first the video I

00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:16,070
was going to show it was super

00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:20,179
off-the-cuff I mean basically I went

00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:22,129
around where where I lived and you know

00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:24,019
I take walks and I meet people that I

00:27:22,129 --> 00:27:25,940
say hello to and I don't really know

00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:28,159
their name but we see each other every

00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:29,539
day so one day I just took out my phone

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,239
and started asking them questions

00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:35,179
questions that I had already so sort of

00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:39,169
like my sample is like twenty or thirty

00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:42,049
people I mean that's as much as like but

00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:45,830
but but we do collect lots of

00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:48,889
information in the KD promo team from

00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:52,129
things like tweets and from reddit and

00:27:48,889 --> 00:27:56,090
from loads of social media that's why we

00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:57,649
know for example that a picture if you

00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:00,409
if you posted a tweet without the

00:27:57,649 --> 00:28:02,899
picture it will do it will do much much

00:28:00,409 --> 00:28:08,210
worse than one with a picture if you

00:28:02,899 --> 00:28:09,950
write a headline which is explicit and

00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:12,200
long that least three or four things

00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:14,239
that are happening in your release that

00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:19,460
will work much much better than one that

00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:22,999
just says X has been released so we're

00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:26,379
trying to formalize it ourselves as yet

00:28:22,999 --> 00:28:31,159
I mean we have quite a lot of data but

00:28:26,379 --> 00:28:35,169
it's kind of hard because we're you know

00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:35,169
we cannot really

00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,380
well it's hard to formalize all that

00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:42,320
it's coming from different sources but

00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:44,570
we're trying and it sort of and we try

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,420
to put it out in things like this and we

00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:49,460
try to and we often share it with with

00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:52,460
other we had a meeting with the gnome

00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:55,610
foundation promo group and we explained

00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:58,610
what we what we had discovered yeah we

00:28:55,610 --> 00:29:03,760
could put I guess once we formalize it a

00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:03,760
point taken yes any more questions that

00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:08,740
times up okay

00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:13,540
