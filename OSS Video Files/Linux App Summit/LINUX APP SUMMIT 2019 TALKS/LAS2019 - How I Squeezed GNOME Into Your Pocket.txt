	00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:18,539
so thank you for the talk

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:20,699
so the next people adriÃ  glasses and his

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,539
talk will be on how i squeezed nam into

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:43,739
your pocket

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:46,710
thank you more now H as the of the

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:55,910
genome games application wait that you

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:55,910
really think that like the g3

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,909
I tell you this implication

00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:37,500
gaming solo oh and that's actually for a

00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:41,159
nerd like me who like gaming and think

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:55,979
absurd a bum when it was at the time was

00:01:41,159 --> 00:02:03,349
what I've what point is it a lot what I

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:03,349
is from name because I worked to make it

00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:15,600
all right

00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:24,140
bring this a lab that you can what as a

00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:28,910
mouth has four possible ways not to tell

00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:30,660
that proper laptops not trained Isis

00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:36,380
poison what do you

00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:36,380
one times air application rubber bits

00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:50,480
and a tooth that three just three

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,300
I was

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,720
earth

00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:43,190
and what plane

00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,260
it's

00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,310
the

00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:29,879
- my app I just like it so what

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,830
you

00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:31,819
- also into account yes

00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:37,810
what going to make it come you phones so

00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:40,490
I try to prototype the same widgets that

00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:50,120
varies intagram have the same behavior

00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:52,580
as didn't come race day sir I was not

00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,300
sure how to name that widget because it

00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:58,520
has to be the good name

00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,949
there was responsive box which is not

00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:07,750
right because it doesn't have stackable

00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:14,379
but because at this time stack but I he

00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:14,379
settled on leaflets for that widget and

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:22,400
here is a prototype in genome contacts

00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:25,699
as you can see there are some graphical

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:30,680
latches was really early at the time but

00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:33,770
it kind of does the job we made it work

00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:37,069
also on some development board we had at

00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:42,279
the time I think it's kiddo who made it

00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:42,279
work so we can't afford

00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:52,660
and I try to go further away by taking a

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,670
larger application like Gary and see how

00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,500
it would work with straight panels so in

00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:59,020
that case you can there is one leaflets

00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,240
contain the two LED panels and leaflets

00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:04,000
containing the left leaflet and the

00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:09,040
right panel which allows to achieve that

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,870
effect and you can see it's convenient

00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,240
also for the desktop adaptiveness is not

00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:15,010
just to take this operation making some

00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,020
mobile it's convenient for the desktop

00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:23,320
itself specially when taketake tiling

00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:24,970
into account and that led us to nineteen

00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,170
months ago second quarter of the

00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:30,430
southern league team and tobias Bernard

00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:37,180
who joined us I think that's about

00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:41,820
around that time maybe wanted some had a

00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:47,020
problem we have lots of column looking

00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:49,840
lists in known that the size were always

00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:52,000
hard-coded so because I can't be too

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,560
long if that windows stupid Lars I have

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,980
to be not too large the only way was to

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:04,740
hard-code the same size but that meant

00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:06,610
that these columns couldn't shrink and

00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,290
that's not what we want obviously

00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:11,740
because we want things to be adaptive

00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:13,570
and to adapt to smaller sizes so we

00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:17,230
developed this widget which kind of

00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:19,360
gives a maximum size to your to whatever

00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:22,720
you put in it it's a simple bin so you

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:26,890
can put any widget in it it will give it

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:30,690
a maximum size and could shrink like bit

00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:34,479
narrower than that I start putting also

00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:36,520
in am web I made it adaptive a bit you

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,510
can see you I don't think you know what

00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,450
the application supposed to look like

00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:42,700
normally we move at the time we were

00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:45,820
moving the application menu inside the

00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:48,520
windows in gnome so it wasn't one of the

00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,900
early adapters but we still had some

00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,700
problems with it for example the search

00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,650
bar was still too wide so when you were

00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:57,790
starting to make a search the windows

00:08:53,650 --> 00:09:01,750
had become big again and was a bit messy

00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:03,430
here's what it looked like and you can

00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:08,470
see the content of the header bar move

00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:10,360
at the bottom so there is no special

00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:12,070
widget to trigger some but for this

00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:16,709
applications like this the best

00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:20,579
so here is on some tablets do it slow

00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:23,860
okay video doesn't work really well but

00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:26,110
it's add apps it's like in desktop mode

00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:30,279
in some way when it's horizontal and

00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:34,380
when Sparky call is in mobile mode and

00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:39,459
we want it to our list of the list of

00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:41,560
pages of tabs in a popover it was still

00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:46,360
the prototype at this time and that

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:49,680
started all that 60 months ago summer of

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:53,350
last year we found some bag when

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,329
animating the title bars and the header

00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:57,970
bars as you can see you can see maybe

00:09:55,329 --> 00:10:01,060
some black you see like the rounded

00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:02,649
parts goes in the middle of the header

00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,779
bar when you try to animate it and

00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:07,510
that's not what he wants that's a word

00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:09,040
by bug and another effect is that in

00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:12,490
that case for example it was a genome

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:16,300
contacts that I started my adaptive as I

00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:18,880
show you um thing is when we use a

00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,190
leaflet so it's like it has multiple

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,980
bars one for the left side which

00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:25,720
contains the older contacts and on the

00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,670
right side there is another header bar

00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,269
for the specific contact your viewing

00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:34,120
when this lifted is folded on itself and

00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:36,370
show only one of the panels well it

00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,399
still has siblings so it's still

00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:42,910
expected to have straight corners where

00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:46,149
it has its sibling it was a word corner

00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:50,500
case and we had to find a workaround for

00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:57,279
this one so what we did was to modify

00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:59,740
the gtk theme to make header bars which

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:04,149
contains head about themselves to not

00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:08,019
draw the background but instead have but

00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:09,970
also have a widget which does nothing we

00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:10,940
just contained a widget and pretends to

00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,460
be a hetero

00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:16,190
now it was a bit tricky but it works I

00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:18,830
mean it's dirty but not too dirty

00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:22,700
well lots of workarounds it's still the

00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:26,090
early days you also needed to have

00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,950
clouds buttons wherever we are in the

00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:30,680
application for example here there is

00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:33,080
only one but then you can see there is

00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:38,330
one on each other bar if you go in

00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:41,810
narrow mode mobile mode Canada lots of

00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:44,330
seems to prototype there were lots of

00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:50,810
glitches and graphical glitches still

00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:54,950
because well code is hard but this got

00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:56,990
fixed just don't be don't feel this

00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:59,960
buzzes and disappeared since quite some

00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,400
time already I started working also on

00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,290
porting some applications more

00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,120
applications like the settings

00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,560
applications not that make the Wi-Fi and

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,670
the Bluetooth panel adapt to society

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:13,190
they can be narrower and work better so

00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,900
that ultimately little by little the

00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:17,990
settings application could be ported you

00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:24,290
will have more pictures later and that

00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:28,090
led us to last autumn 13 months ago we

00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:32,360
found the problem with such bars to wear

00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:34,460
problem is when we put we want search

00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,840
bar to adapt to be large enough the

00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,930
search entry to be large enough on

00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:41,380
desktop so that they can look good but

00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:45,200
on the Mobile's I had to shrink again

00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:47,810
and somehow it didn't work and the

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:54,710
program ended up being that gtk search

00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:57,140
bar in GTA 3 forces its entry is widget

00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:59,089
campaign to be to only take its minimum

00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:01,040
size so if we put a column in self it

00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:03,470
always had its minimum size so if we put

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:07,160
anything in it it would it was not able

00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:09,500
to to adapt vertically so what I did is

00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,170
I have noticed that the issue was fixed

00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:17,450
in GTA 4 so I kind of back ported the

00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:19,790
GTA 4 version in tulip ne and made HD

00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:22,470
white search bar so if you are putting

00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:24,930
your application from GTA 3 to

00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:26,640
utk for don't care you don't have to

00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:28,260
care about this but if you're still

00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,340
using Jessica tree and you want your

00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,040
application to be adaptive you have to

00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:34,500
use that for example an example of what

00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:37,560
we were not able to do you can see the

00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:41,430
search entry is adapting to given the

00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:44,640
available space it was a bit tricky as

00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:48,960
well and then there's a problem we had

00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:51,090
is we had that self this pattern is

00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:54,210
actually common in them is these boxes

00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:57,300
we where we have like just a title on

00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:59,100
the left and some inputs on the right

00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:02,180
lots of lists of them like in

00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:05,070
preferences and thing like that and in

00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:07,440
almost all application it's all custom

00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:09,330
each row is itself a custom

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,130
implementation which led to lots of

00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,270
inconsistencies sometimes even inside

00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:16,110
the applications themselves

00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:19,620
lots of verbosity so instead I as I had

00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:23,370
to modify a lot of curve or for a lot of

00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:26,580
applications you don't want to touch the

00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:28,940
duplicated code everywhere so I just try

00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:33,660
to the widget which made things simpler

00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:36,030
so it's just making C simpler it doesn't

00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,130
really look like much now but it's ended

00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,880
up being more useful later we come back

00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:41,460
to it

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:45,240
I kept supporting my application so

00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:49,280
become clocks it doesn't look good yet

00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:51,330
at the time I mean it was a year ago

00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,080
because we didn't have all the tools we

00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:56,700
needed to make it look good but it

00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:59,850
worked on the phone at least it was it

00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:02,100
was fitting on the phone and usable it's

00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,560
a bit more improvement so we tried a new

00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,960
widget I told you this title bar works

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:10,980
around widget and header hgroup to have

00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:13,050
closed buttons work properly so we've

00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:18,210
solved it porting some contacts a bit

00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:21,960
more and settings lips more panel

00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:27,180
portraits but just keep working keep

00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:29,220
pushing the ball ten months ago ish

00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,740
standard Brown submitted an adaptive

00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:35,400
dialogue which would work as a regular

00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:36,540
dialogue on desktops and but have a

00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,579
close button

00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:43,079
back button instead of a close button in

00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:46,589
its header bar in when it was running in

00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:49,230
a mobile phone so that you can have a

00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:51,360
consistent metaphor like so that the

00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:53,550
dial would look like a view from the

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,149
application on mobile but has a regular

00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:59,100
dialogue on this top it's a bit

00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:02,820
complicated but basically it's it helps

00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:05,160
you think things unified well between

00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,649
desktop and mobile

00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:11,000
we had it more transition to leaflet I

00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:15,480
will show some of you some of them HR to

00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:20,100
some more ports of settings those things

00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:22,860
are well a bit slow in that quarter but

00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:27,350
well quarter to seven months ago we had

00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:32,790
this new widgets designed by Tobias it's

00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:34,110
it's the goal is to show you specific

00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:36,180
views of your application you're like

00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:40,920
the range views to have a widget which

00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:42,540
is always visible but it's different

00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,910
depending on the size of the window as

00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,949
you can see everything it's I think the

00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:51,269
mark-up is pretty clear so we ended up

00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:54,660
implementing that more complex widgets

00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:56,160
like this another problem we had is when

00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,769
using these widgets because it's

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:03,360
adaptive we have centered adaptive

00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:06,089
widgets in the title bar it's if we

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,679
shrink the window it would in with gtk

00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:09,980
head of art would be pushed aside

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,829
as you can see it's not centered and

00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:15,720
then start to be conspire and the a may

00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:18,589
be moved ultimately at the bottom of the

00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,990
window it was a bit tricky so we had to

00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:25,890
fork did you care how about you make it

00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:29,900
forced to center its center widget and

00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:33,780
not push it aside if it can plus a bit

00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:36,090
lots of workarounds again but ultimately

00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:39,990
works it makes things look pretty clean

00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:41,429
and I know the developing Preferences

00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,890
window also to make things simpler and

00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:47,549
adaptive preferences window so that not

00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:49,620
all application would have to implement

00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:52,380
that themselves so

00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:54,990
I got lots of inspiration from the gtk

00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:58,140
shortcuts window API if you know it

00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:01,740
language I suppose a lot of you didn't

00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,690
know it but I told you about this list

00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,730
through widget I developed they ended up

00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:08,340
being really useful because they were

00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:10,799
abstracting was a what we try to do

00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:13,740
because I had properties like a title

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:16,200
subtitle and they were consistent and

00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:19,049
that really became useful because it

00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,789
allowed me to define a model where you

00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:22,440
have like this Preferences window which

00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:25,020
is self-contained pages pages content

00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:29,039
group preferences container or rows and

00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:32,610
rows have titles and that's model that

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:35,190
is consistent allows us to make

00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:38,360
searchable preferences window you have

00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:43,620
will have an example not too far after

00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:46,880
and more parts of dumb clucks now we had

00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:49,740
lots of widget to make it look good so

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:53,279
that's what I did and you will see a

00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:55,049
screen shot later ported the initial

00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,029
setup because we want the initial setup

00:18:55,049 --> 00:19:00,120
to be good on the phone more positive

00:18:57,029 --> 00:19:02,899
numb web I use the Preferences window we

00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:05,190
encountered some mobile specific issues

00:19:02,899 --> 00:19:09,590
and here is the Preferences window I

00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:12,960
told you about so what is nice is that

00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:15,720
what I just did is it looks like this as

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,029
you can see there is like pages at the

00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,440
top for examples on five pages each page

00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:22,760
contain a group for example there is

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,740
like thumbs reading mode and sign and

00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:27,360
this contained preferences preferences

00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,130
or rows and they're implemented with

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,020
that widget I told you and the fact that

00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:33,590
I have a well-defined we have a

00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:38,190
well-defined model with the typos etc

00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:40,679
what I just did is I just pressed ctrl F

00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:44,130
to software team searching and I search

00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:48,330
for pass for password and as you can see

00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:50,330
just searchable

00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:54,779
perform swindle I think it's pretty cool

00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:57,350
and they're all and the benefit of that

00:19:54,779 --> 00:20:00,899
is that there are everything is adaptive

00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:03,300
so I didn't show it I'm stupid I'm not

00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:06,840
doing so but you could shrink it

00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:11,520
and make it work on logo so four months

00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:14,370
ago we had the inclusion of some

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,190
gestures with the paginate err so you

00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:19,710
can swipe with your finger

00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:22,830
we'll always go to produce and the next

00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,750
widget we want to have more gestures we

00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:26,820
are working on it

00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:29,280
well we actually is Thunder McKay Lenco

00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:35,670
who is working on it and candy

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:38,070
contributing to perhaps to work on the

00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:40,020
phone unfortunately we had to GTA

00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,000
itself - well not exactly - for hit but

00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:44,040
to apply patches like for example the

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,780
file chooser dialog is way too large so

00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,240
we had to tweak it to make it work on

00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:53,250
phones message dialogs if you know what

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:56,310
they are they are they have buttons side

00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:58,500
by side making them already large it's

00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:01,230
not great on phone so we made them

00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:04,050
vertical and we did lots of tweaks like

00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:07,830
this what did you get to work on phone

00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:12,210
without contributing to the upstream cut

00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:14,370
bait which is a bit frozen hangar potted

00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:20,640
nama he'll become sapphire which was

00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:23,610
quite a piece to port with a message you

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:28,730
know maybe he came fully ported at the

00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:31,860
time and for website to work well we

00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:35,270
find a word right right around which is

00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:37,860
to make it pretend it's an iPhone

00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:41,070
somehow it works running for YouTube

00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:45,390
that's the only workaround I found for

00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:48,680
to have the proper mobile website with

00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:52,860
wit also the web certificates library

00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:56,160
River libraries so that you could see

00:21:52,860 --> 00:22:00,960
your website's certificate if you ever

00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:04,320
want to but why would you and that led

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,870
us to just like last month we had more

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:12,840
improvements on the leaflet so Alexander

00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:16,620
in kalanchoe again contributed lots of

00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:19,980
wipe related improvements his

00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:26,130
making the leaflets wipeable

00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:29,040
so that's all this well he's making

00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:33,270
everything amazing and we had more

00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:35,850
transition with nice-looking shadows and

00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:37,710
I can finally show you so you can see we

00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:40,440
have nice shadows now on the leaflets

00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,920
and with an under transitions that's

00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:46,530
what was colder than a transition so

00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:49,410
yeah it's far from the biggest thing we

00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:51,510
had at the beginning I've met

00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:54,809
purposefully the animation slow so that

00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:58,230
it's visible what yeah I think it looks

00:22:54,809 --> 00:23:01,410
good nowadays and that has to having

00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:03,390
lots of genome adaptive apps actually

00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:06,679
I'm very surprised by the amount we have

00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:10,080
I mean for example we have like the num

00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:11,850
2048 game is working on phones

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,570
it has imported by its maintainer I

00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:18,720
think we have the COS applications that

00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:20,820
we developed in-house to make phone

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,250
calls and the chance applications that

00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:29,429
we also developed in-house which is for

00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:31,559
SMS and Omaima secure XMPP chat theorem

00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:35,550
chess has been parted to someone

00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:39,350
contributed to genome chess it's not all

00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:43,530
of that is upstream that's my downstream

00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:45,120
fork which is for mobiles and it's I

00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:48,000
think it looks good nowadays I mean

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:51,090
we're far from thing which I show you

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,929
earlier you have contacts has been

00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:56,790
ported there is this drawing app which

00:23:54,929 --> 00:23:59,610
has been designed from the ground up to

00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:03,540
work on the different 5 by someone from

00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:06,420
the community the genome community this

00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:10,460
again a new application which has been

00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:17,370
designed with mobile in mind and it's a

00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:19,950
feed our SAS feed reader tractor so the

00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:23,580
big no matrix client has imported to me

00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:25,320
to be adaptive and work on the phone all

00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,910
of these are screenshots from my dev kit

00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:30,450
if you want to play with the decades

00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:32,700
just come see me and I will

00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:35,640
let you play with it fragment we have

00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:39,320
even turrents client if you want if I

00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,320
want to download torrents on your phone

00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:48,330
dumb games which actually right now

00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:51,840
doesn't run games it crashes because gr

00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:54,620
shenanigans I understand but do you I

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,780
works at least we have the lollipop

00:24:54,620 --> 00:25:01,620
music player which currently pops out of

00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:03,860
the fringe I think it's not much to fix

00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:07,920
but it kinda works

00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:11,760
we have password safe which lets you

00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:22,530
save lots of all your passwords in a

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:23,190
safe way podcasts by where the drop-down

00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:26,100
is hiding

00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:27,960
well a pretty cool podcast reading

00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:31,050
application given settings for example

00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:33,930
here is the Wi-Fi panel application is I

00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:37,200
think is if it's not a rounded person

00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:38,070
parted it's like 95 person part it's on

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,350
the phones

00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:43,980
insole adaptive and upstream if I'm not

00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:47,490
in second there is shortwave nice web

00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:49,440
radio application which also works which

screenshots so we have like a book an

00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:43,080

00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:14,370
around know which is basically a CP but

00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:15,870
graphical so it's really convenient if

00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:18,269
you want to share files between your

00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:20,700
laptop and your phone or between two

00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:23,190
laptops or whatever the Reversi

00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:25,019
application the reverse game of gnome

00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:27,269
which is currently called yagna but is

00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:30,360
being renamed to gnome reverse it

00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:32,130
because I know it has been ported we

00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:35,279
have Authenticator and not even sure

00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:36,870
what it does any match is a pretty cool

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,120
game which has been developed by someone

00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:42,120

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:46,710
the loop telegram the application which

00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:48,450
kind of inspired most of that turns out

00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:50,220
it works well the phone is not economic

00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,769
but I found it pretty cool that it's

00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,870
works almost well I mean you can see

00:27:52,769 --> 00:28:00,529
it's a bit cropped on the right but it's

00:27:54,870 --> 00:28:00,529
really not much and that's all for me

00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:09,499

00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:19,450

00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,380

00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:22,950
hi nice work and in the design process

00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:25,560
did you guys consider like hiding the

00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:29,100
header bar or even get reading of it

00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:31,740
because sometimes it can be a really you

00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:35,990
know waste of space we thought about it

00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:39,270
but we didn't think much about it yet

00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:44,340
it's something in our back catalogue but

00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:51,210
not much fun so far unfortunately there

00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:53,840
are so many things to think about well

00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:53,840
