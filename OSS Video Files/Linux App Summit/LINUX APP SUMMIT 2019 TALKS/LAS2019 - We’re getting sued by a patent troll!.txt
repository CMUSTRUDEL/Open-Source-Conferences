hello so my name is Neil McGovern I am

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:13,769
the executive director of the genome

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,500
Foundation and as some of you may have

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:22,320
heard we're getting sued by a patent

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:25,260
troll before I start I want to say this

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,619
is not legal advice I am NOT your lawyer

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,599
and I'm not a lawyer at all so listening

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:34,260
to me to get any sort of legal advice is

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,450
probably a really bad idea I'm going to

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,730
talk a little bit about what's going on

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,399
and the current status I'm not going to

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:45,030
talk at all about what we're doing about

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,860
it because that requires privilege

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,860
between our lawyers and the Gloam

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:53,309
foundation but I will talk about our

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,570
aims and what we're trying to do and to

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,539
give you a little bit of a story about

00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,059
what it's like to get sued by a patent

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:05,939
troll so how this came about and what

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:08,840
was going on we were at quadric this

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:12,150
year in Thessaloniki in Greece it was

00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,130
fantastic we had a amazing turnout a

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,009
load of people who were really

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:20,900
passionate about Nome and fantastic

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:26,549
weather neutral surroundings wonderful

00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:28,650
plazas great food lots of great beer and

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:29,579
it was a wonderful time we were having a

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,560
great conference

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:33,659
there was loads of people turned up I

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,490
certainly spot some people in this photo

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,689
who around here

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,899
we had a great Welcome Party went to

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,329
hang out with loads of good friends old

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:48,090
and new

00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:51,180
I'm Jewish so again we drank a lot of

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:54,149
beer there's quite a lot of that and I

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,790
meet a lot of fear around the place so

00:01:54,149 --> 00:02:00,719
just to give you a bit of background but

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:05,580
it wasn't all socializing there was also

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:08,190
some very hard work at our beach off

00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,080
where we went swimming so just give you

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:14,630
an idea we'd have a fantastic conference

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,760
and then this was the last sort of

00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:19,350
hackfest workshop birthday that we

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,690
decided this year in graddic we're all

00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:24,330
going to go to the beach instead some

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,280
people didn't want to so they had a

00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,290
museum buff instead so they went around

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,140
a load of museums in Thessaloniki so is

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:36,870
a wonderful way to wind down the

00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:39,300
conference and the last day I saw this

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:43,680
this is parked in Thessaloniki Harbor

00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:45,890
it's a pirate ship it's fantastic so you

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,840
get to go on the pirate ship it's free

00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:50,640
it goes around less Aniki Harbor it's

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,320
fantastic and of course because I'm

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,400
British it's actually secretly a

00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,020
floating bar so the thing about going on

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,260
the pirate ship is you have to order a

00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:04,950
beer so we might have ordered two and it

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:07,800
was fantastic and just as I was getting

00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:12,650
on this ship and therefore going out of

00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,650
Wi-Fi range or any sort of signal range

00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:18,980
my phone goes off and there's a tweet

00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:26,280
we're being sued by a patent troll well

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,750
that's fantastic I just got into a boat

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,030
that's just left the harbour and I have

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,790
absolutely no idea what's going on and I

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,590
haven't even heard about this so this

00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:37,860
wonderful fantastic relaxing day we've

00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,660
had after the stress of organizing a

00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,760
large conference of hundreds of people

00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:46,050
coming along was finally able to relax

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:50,330
and then saw this now for those of you

00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:54,450
that may be unfortunate enough to get

00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:56,910
involved in legal proceedings this is

00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:59,120
not the normal way you get notified of a

00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,120
lawsuit

00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:06,209
over twitter by a third-party mm-hmm so

00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:07,739
I saw this I was on this boat

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:11,459
I couldn't talk to anyone I was out at

00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:16,350
signal range and I had a let's say a

00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:19,680
range of emotions about where we should

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:22,320
go so what's this Twitter talking about

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,900
Oh what is this Twitter talking about

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,560
oh my everything's awful my life is

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:32,539
ruined I was having such a nice time and

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:36,750
then why did I take this job again and

00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:40,289
then finally of course okay let's see

00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:42,330
what we can do let's call our lawyer so

00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:45,870
I finally made it back to ground after

00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:48,449
finishing my beer obviously and called

00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:50,610
Karen Sandler who is one of our the

00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:53,099
genome Foundation's lawyers and as I'm

00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:57,810
sure some of you all know is also the

00:04:53,099 --> 00:05:03,720
IDI of software freedom Conservancy and

00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:06,060
it was about midday her time because

00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,210
she's in New York area

00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,550
oh he's coast somewhere and she was

00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,930
great and said right okay let's have a

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,789
look at this I'm going to have some

00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,979
calls with some other lawyers I'm here

00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:18,750
for you to try and sort it out it's all

00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:20,909
okay you don't need to worry it's

00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:23,430
potentially serious but we can have a

00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:25,530
look at it I'm sure we can get people to

00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:30,919
come and help with this this was

00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:34,860
fantastic so I was slightly more relaxed

00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:37,349
so that evening fortunately is that my

00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:40,289
last evening in Thessaloniki and they

00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:45,990
had just put on a beer festival so I

00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:50,360
obviously went to that I then got on a

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:52,889
plane landed back at London Gatwick and

00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:57,419
had some more emails about this from

00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:59,880
many different people I'm just going to

00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:03,120
go over the patent that it is being in

00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:06,450
that they are that these non-practicing

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,419
entities is saying we infringe and as

00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:12,150
I'm sure everyone knows a picture paints

00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:14,100
a thousand words so I have a sieve about

00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,750
five slides here so that cuts down my

00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,449
slide deck by about five thousand words

00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:22,919
and I'll just explain what these things

00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:26,360
are as they come up that's a circle with

00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:26,360
a camera in and two boxes

00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:35,220
that's a explosive destination ode for

00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:38,970
device as far as I can tell our figure

00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:42,120
three this is a envelope with a keychain

00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:46,229
on it which you put an SD card in to

00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:48,360
send to your friends or something this

00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:50,160
one's great this one's really explains

00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,630
what this patent is all about this is a

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,940
circle in two squares with some arrows

00:06:51,630 --> 00:07:00,150
and then finally a Venn diagram

00:06:53,940 --> 00:07:02,729
involving a camera this is actually the

00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:05,940
claims that stated in the oh six eight

00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:08,160
oh sorry oh eight six patent it's

00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,660
rubbish it's very vague it's really

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,229
complex to understand but it is

00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:16,410
basically plug your camera into your

00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:18,660
computer it says there's photos there

00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,800
you can go show me the photos from

00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:25,460
yesterday and upload them to the

00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,460
internet a method of taking from

00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:32,130
receiving lots of images does this one

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:36,300
work yes receiving lots of images doing

00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:39,630
some sort of filtering where you can do

00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:42,810
some sort of criteria either manually or

00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:46,979
automatically and then transmitting it

00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:50,039
somewhere else so plug your camera into

00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:51,690
your computer it sorts out your images

00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:54,570
and then you can pick whether to upload

00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:59,039
them or not apparently this is a patent

00:07:54,570 --> 00:08:00,810
they hold so I derived a little bit

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:07,440
nervous about what was happening in

00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:11,220
Gatwick and I found dad had an email and

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:15,169
a voice message on our main gnome

00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:18,979
contact number from this group of people

00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:18,979
Shimon and Sterling

00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:28,430
and they were fantastic so they said hey

00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:30,710
we'd like to represent you we've heard

00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:33,860
your nonprofit we've heard you're being

00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:38,060
sued by a patent troll and so we'd like

00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:40,399
to offer you our services as well this

00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:43,820
is going to cost I had a quick look

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:49,040
around and they have something like 400

00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:50,720
lawyers and 80 offices worldwide but

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,769
then I read along a little bit more and

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:58,760
they said I'm not sure this is public

00:08:54,769 --> 00:09:00,170
that it is 8:00 a.m. in California so

00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:04,850
they're not awake yet so then watching

00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:09,260
the stream so it's fine they said they

00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:14,180
would do it pro bono which means if they

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:16,760
don't win you don't have to pay which is

00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:20,329
fantastic and really really useful

00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:22,640
because as a non-profit we have some

00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:24,350
money but nowhere near the amount of

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:29,600
money it takes to properly defend a

00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:32,209
patent case and so we talk to them I

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,399
call Karen Karen says they're fantastic

00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:37,640
she's sat opposite to them in some

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,170
patent cases before and they're really

00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,769
good and we should get involved so this

00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:46,490
involved a couple of weeks of phone

00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:49,459
calls so some with them about who we are

00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:53,089
what we do they wanted to make sure we

00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:55,959
were a proper nonprofit what can happen

00:09:53,089 --> 00:10:00,769
in some cases in the u.s. is you have

00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:02,750
nonprofits who are actually secretly NFL

00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:04,459
baseball teams with millions and teams

00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,630
of like 50 lawyers or something

00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:08,060
themselves so they wanted to make sure

00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:10,010
we we were a proper nonprofit and we

00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,970
this was going to be a thing that we had

00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:16,370
to defend and we started talking about

00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:18,070
strategies and what we were going to do

00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:21,320
and how we were going to approach this

00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:23,750
at this point I started to get a little

00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,120
bit more calm again because we had a

00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:29,560
really good team of people who were able

00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,560
to to help

00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:37,499
and then at some point we worked out

00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:41,819
that we needed to go public about all of

00:10:37,499 --> 00:10:44,550
this so we we published a statement on

00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:48,589
our website saying we are aware of it

00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:51,660
that someone had sent us it over Twitter

00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:55,980
we think it's baseless and we intend to

00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:58,290
vigorously defend that's a fairly bland

00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,910
statement I'm not going to tweet that

00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:04,799
yeah we're being sued we're totally

00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:07,139
guilty so this was a bit of a holding

00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:13,889
statement but in the background there

00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:16,559
was quite a lot of work going on so we

00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:20,610
had a look at some of this we reached

00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:22,410
out to various organizations and we had

00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:26,910
lots of offers of support from those

00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:29,279
organizations there was various things

00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:32,579
we could have done at this time we could

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,949
have written to rough trial patent

00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:38,839
imaging and saying hey our lawyers are

00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:41,129
like pro bono so your standard method of

00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:42,569
extorting money out of people isn't

00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:45,299
going to work this time because the

00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:47,429
calculations are different in fact we

00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:49,949
did receive a settlement offer from them

00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:53,850
fairly early on I think three or four

00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:57,179
days after they filed to this offering a

00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:59,279
if we paid them the high tens of

00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:01,170
thousands of dollars so heisted high

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,999
five figures then they would give us

00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,470
license and all this would go away and

00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:07,139
we didn't need to worry about him we

00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:10,889
didn't need to pay lots of lawyers we

00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:17,069
said thank you very much but no which

00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:19,079
slightly confuse them Shimon suggested

00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:22,649
we could write to them and say hey we're

00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:24,899
pro bono and then maybe Shimon and then

00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:26,730
maybe what child would drop off and just

00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:31,829
say oh it's there it's too much hassle

00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:34,549
and I'm in my second or third phone call

00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:38,569
with them when I told them my objectives

00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:38,569
so my objectives was

00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:48,399
to just win the case I wanted to make

00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:51,580
sure that that child and any patent

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:54,220
troll out there would not ever dream of

00:12:51,580 --> 00:13:03,220
attacking any free software project ever

00:12:54,220 --> 00:13:06,100
again and they would for me it's bigger

00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:09,070
it's bigger than just you know I think

00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,240
they have sued six other companies I

00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,250
believe at the same time

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,440
pretty much within 24 hours of each

00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,450
other over the same patent five other

00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:20,880
proprietary companies haven't really

00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:23,770
heard of them or what they do before but

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,000
given the breadth of the of the patterns

00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:28,149
it's not too surprising they managed to

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,010
find someone so I and this is my

00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:33,480
personal opinion I don't think

00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:36,399
Rothschild targeted free software I

00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:39,610
don't think they targeted us because

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:42,490
we're a non-profit interestingly the day

00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:44,200
before we got sued we just announced

00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:46,209
that we'd got a half million dollar

00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,120
donation and I'm sure these are nothing

00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:53,110
to do with each other whatsoever but the

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:56,410
timing is a little suspicious so I don't

00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:59,830
think they realized what they'd got

00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:02,170
themselves into and we wanted to show

00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:04,740
them that you attack any free software

00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:07,150
project and this will go badly for you

00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:12,390
attack others all you want go from

00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:16,920
dietary companies you do that okay but

00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:20,800
hands-off free software not only will we

00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:24,880
not pay you your fee which you're asking

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:28,089
for we will make sure this goes to court

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,600
and we will win it and then we will get

00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:37,300
your patents invalidated as well this

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:39,940
needs to hurt and so when I had that

00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:43,870
call with the lawyers they were

00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:45,340
rather happy it is very it is not very

00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:48,940
often that you can tell though I was

00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:52,330
just going yeah so you know that thing

00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:54,460
you really want to do to go and like go

00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:57,010
completely crazy and just like do your

00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:59,320
best and just completely wipe out the

00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:01,810
other side yeah go do that that's fine

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,280
that's great don't worry about it we're

00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,350
not worried too much about the risk here

00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,020
we're not we're a little bit worried

00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:11,650
about paying for it but they that's fine

00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:18,210
our aim here is to send a message that

00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:24,400
this must never ever happen again so I

00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:27,790
decided to go public we I wrote a press

00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:32,160
release and a blog post saying what was

00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:37,810
going on saying that we have been sued

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:40,180
and that we found out over twitter they

00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:42,550
did so the way it works in the u.s. is

00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,800
you have to legally serve people so you

00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:46,650
have to like physically give a bit of

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,310
paper to someone in California

00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,440
unfortunately for us this is in

00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:53,710
California not the Northern District of

00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:56,620
Texas where it is traditionally where

00:15:53,710 --> 00:16:02,820
patent violations get filed so it is in

00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:02,820
California it is in our home state and

00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:09,490
when you register in the US you have to

00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:12,760
have an agent who potentially represent

00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:16,870
your interests in that state they had

00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:18,790
sent it to our agent except it had been

00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:20,110
the agent we hadn't used for about seven

00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,970
years and they got the wrong address

00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:25,960
because I think they googled the wrong

00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:27,820
address or something so we didn't

00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:30,280
actually get the paperwork or anything

00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:39,160
they're filed with us for ages but it's

00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:43,660
fine and we filed three three bits of

00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:46,330
paper three motions first was a motion

00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:48,460
to dismiss now this is a thing where you

00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:50,630
can say look before the see even case

00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:53,149
get started before we even look at this

00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:55,880
can we like resolve this issue here

00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:58,759
first because we think that's important

00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,980
and if we resolve this in our favor then

00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:04,130
the rest of it doesn't matter and our

00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,510
case is that this patent should never

00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:10,880
have been granted in the first place

00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:15,049
it's overly broad its violates Alice

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,730
it's something that an interesting one

00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:18,559
is it's there's nothing in this patent

00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:22,069
that can't be done by a human

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:25,909
there's no invention here there's new no

00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:31,820
magic new way of working so plug voters

00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:35,000
in sort by date upload to Internet can

00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:36,919
be done entirely by a human because they

00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,080
also said in their filing that it can't

00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:40,669
be done by a human so that's an

00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,770
interesting way to approach that and so

00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:49,039
our aim here is to get that patent

00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:53,419
invalidated our second one is our answer

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:55,610
to the complaint which is about how

00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:57,770
Shotwell is affects this patent and

00:17:55,610 --> 00:18:01,100
particular things around that and we

00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:04,610
think we deny all the claims except the

00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:08,150
pure factual ones I think we do admit

00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:12,140
that we are a 501 C 3 admitted in the US

00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:15,020
but that's pretty much it and then our

00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:17,090
third one is our countersuit we're

00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:19,340
essentially saying this is a rubbish

00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:23,630
patent they know it's a rubbish patent

00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:24,380
and because it shouldn't be patent in

00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,700
the first place

00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,130
and if you're a good lawyer you should

00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:32,059
know that and we'd kind of like all our

00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:35,450
fees paid for by them for them giving

00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:41,020
the wonder of suing us now that went

00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:41,020
public it got quite a lot of press and

00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:47,270
loads of people have been really really

00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:50,330
supportive of us and what we're trying

00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:57,169
to do here we've been talking with

00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:59,059
organisations as well so the öin the

00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:01,280
open innovation network of which way a

00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:02,810
member have also lent us a lot of lawyer

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,860
time too

00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:11,150
find prior art in case we need it that

00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:13,250
far we hopefully soon there will be

00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,230
something coming out on the e FF blog

00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,480
about this highlighting our case and

00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:21,470
many organizations around as well

00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:23,450
including including for example software

00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:26,030
freedom service II who've shown their

00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:29,450
supporter and many others and it's been

00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:34,820
really heartening to see the entire free

00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:38,210
software community rally around so a

00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:41,600
quick question I had it is how much does

00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:43,580
this cost does anyone know how much it

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:49,250
costs to successfully defend against a

00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:51,310
patent case in the u.s. 50 quid so okay

00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,630
we have 50 mmm

00:19:51,310 --> 00:20:04,850
10 million it's somewhere in between

00:19:53,630 --> 00:20:09,880
those two numbers it costs on average

00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:09,880
about 1.5 million dollars to just defend

00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:19,520
that included time included No so so for

00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:22,520
the lawyer time but then if it gets

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,050
complex so if you want to get the patent

00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,910
invalidated you have to go through the

00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:28,790
US patents office through something

00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:32,300
called P tab that's 30 grand just to

00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:34,730
file without actually any lawyer time or

00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:41,510
paying for expert witnesses which we

00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:45,890
need this is not cheap does everybody

00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:51,250
have a phone with a camera on it get

00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:51,250
your phone out there's one of these

00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:09,029
and I hope everyone's dreaming as well

00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:09,029
is watching this as well

00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:30,130
I'll also know if you actually do manage

00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:33,130
to visit this page because this is live

00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:35,019
view so we can watch as you kindly come

00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:36,580
and donate to us so we are watching

00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:40,659
everywhere so thank you very much for

00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,679
everyone who has more importantly we

00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:44,230
launched this about a week and a half

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,629
ago and we raised over 140 thousand

00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:47,830
dollars which was of our original goal

00:21:46,629 --> 00:21:50,470
which was a hundred and twenty five

00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:55,870
which is fantastic and this will enable

00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:59,019
us to actually give a good defense it

00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:01,330
certainly initially of free software and

00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:07,149
not just of no and interestingly for us

00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:12,159
it was over 38 sorry 3,800 individuals I

00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:15,539
also want to say particular thanks to to

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,590
Debian who have given us $5,000 and

00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:20,649
hopefully will sit we will be announcing

00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:23,429
soon a sneak preview linux australia are

00:22:20,649 --> 00:22:25,899
also giving us $5,000 to help protect

00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:31,450
because i really do believe that yes

00:22:25,899 --> 00:22:34,149
thank you very much shuttle and to of

00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:36,990
course everyone who has donated and it's

00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:39,730
okay if you can't donate that's fine

00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:42,940
what I will ask you to do is spread the

00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:45,240
word is let people know that free

00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:49,539
software is under attack this is not

00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:52,809
just about you know this is about the

00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:54,490
attack on free software by a patent

00:22:52,809 --> 00:23:01,120
troll and we've all known for many years

00:22:54,490 --> 00:23:03,759
that software patents are dangerous does

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,850
it matter if we write our code using a

00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:11,409
open source free software license and we

00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:13,149
distribute it to millions if it suddenly

00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:14,769
turns out the software's patented and we

00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:17,110
need to pay license fees for every

00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:20,740
single copy of the code what does it

00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:22,960
mean and so we wanted to send that

00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:25,500
message that this can't happen and it's

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,510
not just about the money

00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,050
what we wanted to show is the amount of

00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:33,510
people and the amount of public outcry

00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:35,940
that happens when you attack a free

00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:37,860
software project like this so it's about

00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,840
the community coming together and it's

00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:43,230
about sending that message if you show

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,270
any free software project the rest of

00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:48,720
free software and the rest of the world

00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:51,030
will come and will be angry and will

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,540
come and help and they won't stand for

00:23:51,030 --> 00:24:00,380
it I should point out I'm sure there's

00:23:54,540 --> 00:24:05,400
nobody here in future if anyone does

00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:09,720
find themselves subject to this people

00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:13,340
who support you should not send the

00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:16,940
opposing counsel horrible nasty emails

00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,940
that's not helpful

00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:23,610
so the way we win these things is

00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,280
through beating people in court it's not

00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:29,820
by being really quite unpleasant in the

00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,930
internet so that's been a bit of an

00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:38,010
eye-opener

00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:42,600
I how much time if I used oh I've got

00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:45,590
about five minutes or so left so yeah

00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:49,470
that's where we are today our next

00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:51,690
potential court filing that the main

00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:53,730
court case is probably if it continues

00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:55,620
is going to happen in March so there's

00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:57,690
quite a lot of time but there's lots of

00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:01,020
discovery and things that happens before

00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:03,000
then I'm not going to talk about too

00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:06,450
much about what our tactics are or the

00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,190
way we're approaching it or the things

00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:11,010
we've discovered so far about this

00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:15,150
patent case or our approach to it what I

00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:18,510
will reassure people is that our aim

00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:20,790
here is to protect free software in

00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:24,780
general as I think that's the most

00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:26,370
important principle here please follow

00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,960
along on ground rule if you want any

00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:29,700
updates I think there's a mailing list

00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,320
as well if you want to see kind of

00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:35,310
what's happening and so keep up to date

00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:38,370
and are interested I have about five

00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:38,970
minutes left so I will probably not

00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,559
answer it

00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:42,179
single question you ask me because

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,070
they'll be interesting questions which I

00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:45,929
can't talk about

00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:48,330
however if anyone does have any

00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:49,950
questions and wants to ask something

00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:52,169
that I can answer without my lawyers

00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:54,710
shouting at me then please feel free to

00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:54,710
ask away

00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:07,240
I'm gonna do a follow-up question yes

00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:09,280
nobody's asking Soho similar so you had

00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:14,920
that problem back a few years ago about

00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:16,600
the ad which company was right like they

00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:19,780
want they try to market something called

00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,520
Nome it's the similar case do you feel

00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:23,650
this is similar or is it very different

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,330
or what you're feeling about it

00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,730
yeah it's similar in a way and it's very

00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:29,590
different in another way so this for

00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:32,470
those who don't know a company called

00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:35,620
Groupon you may know do those voucher

00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:37,720
off things they decided that they wanted

00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:40,179
to produce a computing advise device

00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:43,720
with software and they wanted to call it

00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:46,960
gnome and they filed a trademark for

00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:48,670
genome in the u.s. despite us having

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,110
that trademark and we talked to them for

00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:51,900
a few months and tried to remind them

00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:54,280
the saying hey we've got this already

00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:58,780
could you not and they ignored us and

00:26:54,280 --> 00:27:01,510
they filed it anyway we pointed out to

00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:04,600
them that some of the engineers on the

00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:07,059
Groupon official log we're talking about

00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:09,580
kinome and the software that they were

00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:12,130
using on the desktop and so they kind of

00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:14,830
knew about this already but they filed

00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:16,540
it anyway so we responded essentially

00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:19,480
doing the same asking for money and the

00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:21,520
outcry from that was similarly amazing

00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,860
which is why I was partially fairly

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:26,950
confident that this would work the

00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:30,280
attack on free software despite even if

00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:35,260
you and some of the comments I've seen

00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:37,270
from people who have donated have I'm

00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:40,660
very British so what I'll say is that

00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:43,770
they were mildly disappointed when

00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,770
genome 3 came along

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:52,490
despite that they still donated but the

00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:54,530
recognition that this it is a that this

00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:56,690
is something that is not acceptable and

00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:57,890
is something wider in his attack on all

00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:59,270
the free software even if you don't

00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:01,520
disagree with it is something that is

00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:04,190
very similar unfortunate it's not a

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:07,280
trademark it's a patent and it isn't

00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:09,350
something that has just been filed and

00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:11,330
we need to say hey we already have it

00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:15,770
this is something that has been assigned

00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:17,150
a judge and it is in court and there is

00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:21,130
a real-life judge and this is a

00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:25,760
real-life case and if we're unable to

00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:29,060
make progress and meet our objectives

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:31,220
that we want in time then they have

00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:34,340
people standing up in a court case in

00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:36,560
front of a judge to go through this and

00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:44,290
decide if we violated some pattern so

00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:51,260
the the stakes are somewhat higher so

00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:54,530
host everything so now we have an

00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:58,130
opportunity to educate the free software

00:28:54,530 --> 00:29:01,130
community and just put everyone

00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:04,040
everybody else about patent trolls are

00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:07,130
will you be are there any plans or

00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:10,940
possibility to you know work with the US

00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:17,330
government and think about patent reform

00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:26,360
or some other thing as something like

00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:28,340
that so there has been a historically an

00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:35,090
issue of patents and software patents

00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:37,670
being being granted was talking to the e

00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:40,010
FF this is particularly useful because

00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:42,140
there are some pieces of legislation

00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:47,210
that have tried to recently go through

00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:48,560
the House and the Senate in the u.s. one

00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:52,450
of them got dropped the second one's

00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:55,550
kind of stalled out but a lot of the

00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:57,410
conversation around that is people going

00:29:55,550 --> 00:30:00,560
like yeah we need this to protect

00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:02,090
like inventions and inventors and this

00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:05,720
is important because this protects

00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:07,550
innovation and then because of the

00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,840
blatant abuse of the patent system

00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:10,670
that's happened in the past there's

00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:13,670
actually quite a lot of pushback just

00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:15,560
saying ah but what about non-practicing

00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:17,900
entities what about patent trolls and

00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:19,460
then those the lobbying firms pushing

00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,870
for this go that doesn't happen anymore

00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:23,300
they don't exist

00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:27,380
they've all been driven out of it out of

00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:30,260
practice I think you'll find if they're

00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:32,720
suing a non-profit maybe they do still

00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:35,720
exist and this is a still a thing that

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:39,620
happens so it is sort of useful to

00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,940
remind governments that and political

00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:44,300
parties that this is still an issue that

00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:46,640
affects us lots of lobbying goes through

00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,980
the e FF for example for that to also

00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,690
Free Software Foundation and the various

00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:59,390
foundations around it to try and do that

00:30:50,690 --> 00:31:01,790
as a 501 C 3 we are unlimited into how

00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:05,330
much we can do political lobbying we're

00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:07,910
a non-profit so basically political

00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:09,550
lobbying can form no major part of our

00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:12,650
operations it has to be only minor

00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:15,170
incidental etc so we can't as a

00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:18,230
foundation directly do that however if

00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:20,150
anybody feels strongly about this or any

00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:23,510
issue in fact I would encourage you to

00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:25,850
as a previous politician I would

00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:27,710
encourage you to contact your political

00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:31,490
representatives and talk to them about

00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:36,080
your concerns not don't send a mass

00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:38,990
email call them ask for a meeting have a

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,090
chat with them if you actually this this

00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:42,920
doesn't just apply to genome and patents

00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:44,420
and everything else but more in general

00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:47,300
if you want to get through to a

00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:49,400
politician have a meeting with them talk

00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,870
to them the more effort you put into

00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,340
talking and approaching to politicians

00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:55,160
the more they'll pay attention to you

00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:56,720
when I was a politician I had hundreds

00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,640
of emails and especially if it's a

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,010
compound a campaign which is copy and

00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,690
paste then you just delete them all and

00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:05,300
you just go oh well five thousand people

00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:07,430
sent me a email petition about this okay

00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,230
well some people care about this but the

00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:11,040
impact of someone going and sitting down

00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:13,110
to you and explaining to you is you

00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,610
in human language about why this is

00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:17,550
important and why it affects you is

00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:20,760
incredibly powerful so if you care about

00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:22,380
this go contact your representatives try

00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:25,110
and set up a meeting talk to them and

00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,760
that through that way we might actually

00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:33,810
be able to make some really good changes

00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:40,580
I think I have maybe one more question

00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:43,290
if I'm lucky quick question

00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:45,060
I'll promise I'll answer quickly look I

00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:47,730
have no idea

00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:50,220
software patterns actually but they

00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:52,020
exist in you ask but do we also have

00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:55,050
them in Europe and like what does it

00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:58,440
mean for a solo project like can we also

00:32:55,050 --> 00:33:03,870
have like software trials or if we in

00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:08,600
fret right I do patent in fragment can

00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:08,600
we do that like since it's US law or

00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:16,710
they don't exist in Europe you can still

00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:19,170
be affected by them because you can get

00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:21,420
seed if you have a user in the US you

00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:22,890
can get sued over it but the extra

00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:26,640
advantage of you get to fly to the US to

00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:29,490
defend it so you could argue

00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:33,480
jurisdiction but that's part of the

00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:35,450
issue is this this concept that oh this

00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:38,730
exists in the US but not in Europe is

00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:39,360
fine but it doesn't actually work see

00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:41,340
gdpr

00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,570
you can't just go oh well I'm in the

00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:44,430
u.s. so I'm going to ignore it because

00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:46,350
that's a European thing because it

00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:48,330
involves it born in Europe so the fact

00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:51,120
that this exists in one jurisdiction

00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:53,580
means it exists essentially for all

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,370
global projects and if you touch the US

00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:58,380
at all then if you touch any country you

00:33:56,370 --> 00:34:00,660
can become subject to their regimes that

00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:04,100
is a overly broad answer I am NOT a

00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:04,100
lawyer please go talk to a lawyer

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:19,200
wait wait wait is a pushy for approving

00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:23,129
several patents in Europe son years ago

00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:26,609
we have a fight we want I think many

00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:30,929
many propellers my baby by the mineral

00:34:26,609 --> 00:34:33,210
but I am Not sure that the the the big

00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:35,849
love is especially from from United his

00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:38,669
company are still pushing and lobbying

00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:41,729
to try again at some point in the future

00:34:38,669 --> 00:34:44,039
forever in the European Union and yes

00:34:41,729 --> 00:34:46,139
another point there are other countries

00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:49,919
also than the United States that they

00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:53,609
have so what patterns do I think may he

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:55,499
go I think Canada and maybe others so it

00:34:53,609 --> 00:35:01,079
could be relevant to it depending the

00:34:55,499 --> 00:35:02,309
market area yes yeah with with WIPO and

00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:04,140
there's something called a maturity

00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:06,059
protocol as well which if you get a

00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:07,950
patent granted somewhere you can sort of

00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:09,900
get it ported and applied in other

00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:11,519
countries as well so even if one

00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,559
particular jurisdiction doesn't let you

00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:16,019
register it you might be able to get it

00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:17,819
in so the point is that we should all no

00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:19,259
matter where we live and no matter where

00:35:17,819 --> 00:35:20,910
our projects are based is we should all

00:35:19,259 --> 00:35:24,150
care about software patents globally

00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:26,670
because it all affects us anyway

00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:29,400
so I know I'm definitely out of time and

00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:31,520
I'm getting some looks so thank you very

00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:36,699
much everyone

00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,699
