00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:26,340
been working with pee for quite some

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:28,890
time now I think yeah every time I can't

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:33,390
detect a little bit older it's been like

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:36,450
over 10 years now I started working on

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:41,369
applications actually my first project

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:44,220
was later for students then I started

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:46,680
working on an ID and then started

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,470
working on lots of things when I got

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:53,899
hired by resistors I am still working

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:56,190
for and there I do have a tea somewhere

00:01:53,899 --> 00:02:02,070
but some other things that we will be

00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:04,250
about over here so actually when we're

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,620
talking about na s we're talking about

00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:12,090
what we wanted to do

00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:14,960
thank you very well know Lal it's the

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:17,910
first time a little different of cement

00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:22,200
home librivox on and we're thinking a

00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:27,450
lot about but want to go and wild of

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:34,320
tested works appeared a lot of times in

00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:37,500
part our vision Passaic because well our

00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,330
bidding my feeling was our American

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,950
Center that what we actually care about

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:47,460
this one that's how I showed people use

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:51,660
computers and and what I would like to

00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:57,470
talk about today just today but but oh

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:57,470
hi and how are we taking on the moment

00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,370
well thank you very well know

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:13,760
specifically Kozma have been looking the

00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:13,760
whole mobile phone

00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:46,830
and that's because one of the first

00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,810
changes that use that with the Alliance

00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:51,540
that nobody need to have a shelter

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,910
worries on parsing their friends are

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,670
giving you 4 different hard but it's

00:03:53,910 --> 00:04:00,060
basically that we will make you start to

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:04,910
create a ton of different new

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:08,170
applications there's set of duplicated

00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:10,790
we decide to like the only hero who

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:15,700
detached from tables which we have cut

00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:18,770
or a while and not dogs for example but

00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:24,320
that can't start using it while watching

00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:26,420
TV or when you are on the phone in this

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,900
case when we hang on the pocket and

00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:32,330
you're running late - that tastes and

00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:35,990
you come it's an actual application

00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:38,630
right it's not something that we have or

00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:41,900
we do actually have knocking application

00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:44,000
for desktop but the kind of use cases

00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:48,130
that you need and how you're going to

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:57,640
update them on a phone is is different

00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:57,640
no it's mostly about thinking people

00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:06,110
with a new scenario and drive with the

00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:08,660
device anymore that you can have a

00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:13,430
keyboard you know you have to shoot that

00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:15,920
they don't have a first print I guess

00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm saying these things but I think that

00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:22,750
this is important that we remember

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:29,330
ourselves that these are the kind of

00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:31,730
we're seeing it now in KD we try to take

00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:34,190
on big projects but with people we know

00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:37,640
that it's done from the community and by

00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:41,390
the community and actually well we don't

00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:43,690
have like the army of people that Google

00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:47,750
or Apple might have to take of these

00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:53,900
problems we've also done have their

00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:56,690
money back so with the strategy around

00:05:53,900 --> 00:06:03,910
the idea of making server and and creepy

00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:03,910
now that we aspire they will be used

00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:14,990
with a different set of values that we

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,889
have nowadays but that today well the

00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,110
amount of

00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:20,560
you're gonna have around our but leave

00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:23,139
it to what the community is quiet

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:27,379
we want to be communities that we have

00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:28,849
suffered world on the end use of this

00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:33,830
upper world but then on the other hand

00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:35,659
it's it's very humble thousands and

00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,180
millions of people who actually go there

00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:44,840
today because of their work or their

00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:45,590
passions and well this number is is what

00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,830
you're talking about

00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:52,300
right when for us today it would be a

00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:55,009
success with three thousand of people

00:06:52,300 --> 00:07:01,250
started to use last month their mobile

00:06:55,009 --> 00:07:03,979
phones this is the number Google the

00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:06,349
number of Android devices that I think

00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:13,039
are coming around the world right we're

00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:16,909
talking about people who in their pocket

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:21,139
in their TV on their target our friends

00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:23,569
operating system and from as many

00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:26,029
perspectives actually be even kind of

00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:42,969
mean to say no no we're gonna create a

00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:48,439
new platform platform with our software

00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:56,270
and quality has been around for a long

00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:57,500
while advantages is pretty clear about

00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:02,810
and they have they have been pushing

00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:06,649
from the beginning actually QT framework

00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:10,669
that be good to pay the beginning that

00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:15,610
for gone on Windows and linens and an

00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:17,730
event a mark and then actually it was

00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:23,820
[Music]

00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:27,020
Oh Matias started developing pity on top

00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:33,000
of it and this money became this offer

00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:40,650
but when the Beau Biden sucks being a

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:44,100
thing they Android and iOS and that's

00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:47,580
why I created up here all of our

00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:50,220
software theoretically is properly being

00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,830
if you don't leave it on the thing

00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,690
they're gonna work on the different

00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:58,560
operating systems we didn't end up

00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:04,580
having this week because of the digital

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:11,010
problems but we had these yesterday by

00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:15,570
Rita and if you do at his post you'll

00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:19,410
see that this message was kind of weird

00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:21,270
flourishing because we're on on the

00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,510
Windows Store they have a very

00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:39,210
compelling story of all public ticket

00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:42,170
free software our our trains by creating

00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:44,280
the application to work on Windows and

00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:48,000
and maybe other platforms as well

00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:49,890
putting Linux but it's not it's and

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,360
actually they're everything living out

00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:55,610
of it which is not something that I'm

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:59,840
gonna claim over here but I'm gonna

00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,840
number again because I think it's

00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:17,270
actually one of my most participating

00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,270
experiences when

00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,429
[Music]

00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:56,230
actually in a way exactly like a check

00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:56,230
and this word actually

00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:11,420
well you support these library is really

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,860
but buzzes what's the problem with that

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,730
well the problem with that is at the

00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:20,840
moment and we're paper than which you

00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:23,470
will be nominee especially in the

00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,470
situation we are

00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:30,970
hi and Judaism fix it without giving up

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:36,100
our boat that people just use that and

00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:39,920
enjoy your free summer mobility library

00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:59,060
because of that we started created the

00:12:39,920 --> 00:13:01,520
Big Brother which is on the but also iOS

00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:04,070
so at the moment but we're not gonna

00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,500
claim that our vacations are the gambia

00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:10,280
deviation is perfectly integrated on

00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:13,010
desktop and Android and iOS

00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:17,450
definitely for example not much of a

00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:24,530
vacation but you can use it successfully

00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:29,600
and heavily on an Android device and so

00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:48,640
like for me the goal is to not end up I

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:54,230
don't know perfect right thanks a

00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:57,050
vacation why don't you try to run it on

00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:58,850
Android and and and see how it feels

00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:01,430
why don't you try to like put it on

00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:04,730
Google Play maybe and have people who

00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:16,730
are suffering from the lack of freedom

00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:18,290
is 100 well it's some freedom so what we

00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,810
started doing what I started doing back

00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:25,480
and I started with algebra actually this

00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:25,480
application has on the

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:38,440
[Music]

00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:38,440
and then the n9 and yeah but actually

00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:46,640
they were didn't sitting right like the

00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:50,180
applications were death but well I do

00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:55,400
that just by aggregation over there spam

00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:57,440
and evening afternoon we to say let's

00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,630
make my application work on this device

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,400
ported to the different API is that were

00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:04,400
completely different from what were

00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:18,170
using Dan and actually what we are using

00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:26,030
right now you people are nowadays will

00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:29,990
be working on or linens deny step right

00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:32,030
not on the same fish will say this even

00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:35,090
nowadays while they use Q then we should

00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:39,230
be happy about it is well they use these

00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:41,870
version of gift from of the past and we

00:15:39,230 --> 00:16:05,300
don't only need to adopt our UX into

00:15:41,870 --> 00:16:07,880
there eventually hundred as soon as fit

00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,920
for was available on on trade and I

00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,320
already knew about this concept off

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:19,090
everything is one I think that you put

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:21,650
it inside all of our education site and

00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:25,010
what he did and the work actually

00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:30,310
ultimately well start thinking about a

00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:32,190
good one these replication work on

00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:34,949
device

00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:38,610
your pocket are there different new

00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:41,629
skins and I didn't have to wait for some

00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:45,600
of these you start developing what

00:16:41,629 --> 00:16:47,339
operating system for my pocket to be

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,709
able to decide what the application is

00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:52,860
blue like it feels already actually

00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:59,129
start having users feedback developing

00:16:52,860 --> 00:17:01,949
improving and then today's mobile is a

00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:04,709
reality a reality I mean it's something

00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:06,689
I can tell but my mom just using

00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:12,839
everything inside using what may put

00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:25,650
your son is pretty thing I think that we

00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:29,610
need to hear about maybe application has

00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:33,530
been around it E and we suffer for a

00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:36,059
decade as well and they also have this

00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:38,520
idea of start importing the application

00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:41,429
from several platforms they even had

00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:45,900
some UNIX that was take it was for forty

00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:49,130
nine hundred that was specific for going

00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:52,049
with your bike is something that as

00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:54,059
developer of linens today we cannot

00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:56,220
think about right unless you are

00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:59,880
strapping your laptop to your your bike

00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:06,559
you need to well what ways and for them

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:13,470
this was hundred is that certification

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:17,100
the potato man because it's actually

00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:20,880
pretty interesting it's called the inner

00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:24,390
and it's about every time you buy a bike

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,510
and we're all trained actually it works

00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:33,260
with concert tickets and this kind of

00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:33,260
stuff to get and these

00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:44,150
nowadays we have to tell people you when

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:47,790
you travel you in is Mary

00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:49,440
so that you can't go through security on

00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:53,190
the airport right this is going to be

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,500
and but obviously all of the people who

00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:57,810
are mostly concerned about mobile and

00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,520
happen upon the hour today and making

00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:02,100
sure that the address book works making

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:13,020
sure that the polling application works

00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:16,560
but so we need to have this colonization

00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:22,470
of different visions and for people to

00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:25,350
embrace one is all in free software in

00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:27,590
technologies that are computed with the

00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,670
vision of how we think that the

00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:32,970
operating system should it should be

00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:37,680
working how people should be using IT in

00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:39,480
general but this is an IRC client which

00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:43,350
is something for me still guide you

00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:46,170
where to use wanna wanna dome at some

00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:51,090
point I decide that we really have to

00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:53,750
make we have to make much easier to a

00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:56,420
lot of applications for Android

00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:58,740
beginning when I started doing was

00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:12,840
framing the different dependencies we

00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:23,180
have because are so and let's see what

00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:26,010
vacations that we use on a daily basis

00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:28,500
well what they're going to do they're

00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:31,410
moving and stuff I compile it for

00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,750
Android and this is a word actually what

00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:36,000
writing looks like crap but it's not the

00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:39,320
point the point is that if you're

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,320
somebody must say

00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,869
[Music]

00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,299
[Music]

00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:49,700
because and what and

00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,479
[Music]

00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:36,030
[Laughter]

00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,900
actually

00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:54,079
[Music]

00:25:42,460 --> 00:26:33,820
you say this drove nice drove from

00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:35,660
flatbeds now it might change vision

00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:37,850
destroy fine by us

00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:39,410
there's not support there is not support

00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:43,790
walking this power which is a soccer

00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:45,740
center so if you pass then go for

00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:48,790
Android we have we're using information

00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,790
from the petrol

00:26:53,530 --> 00:28:44,720
so the similarities the assets are to

00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:46,820
saying I can start the same but it makes

00:28:44,720 --> 00:29:01,870
sense to explore things from from the

00:28:46,820 --> 00:29:06,580
top your for photography there were we

00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:07,929
to get things done so that people can

00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:10,600
start working on the part of their

00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:19,150
applications on the calculator you can

00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:23,669
work on your application Meza has all of

00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:23,669
the things on there perfectly

00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:41,610
[Applause]

00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:47,030
[Music]

00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:47,030
[Applause]

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,809
it was hard and actually the hard part

00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:19,990
was but I wanted to make it easy for you

00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:23,320
to buy so what we're doing one all of

00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:25,419
these applications or at least 99% of

00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,249
the cases is that you shouldn't mean or

00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:30,190
you shouldn't have to modify your cine

00:30:27,249 --> 00:30:31,749
scripts or anything things just work and

00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:38,350
if it doesn't it probably means that

00:30:31,749 --> 00:30:41,940
there but if you use to make is you

00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:46,269
wouldn't have this this disadvantage if

00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:49,690
you allow our Altos things that should

00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:50,889
be the case I don't try it and tell me

00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:55,090
if you're happy if you're happy that

00:30:50,889 --> 00:31:02,420
means that you're not happy then takes

00:30:55,090 --> 00:31:02,810
it thank you all very much

00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,930
[Applause]

00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:05,930
