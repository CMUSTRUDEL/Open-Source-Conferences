my name is Hannah and I'm Kati

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:10,380
contributor for nearly ten years now

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:12,030
when I first started developing C++ on

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,280
Windows it was horrible to get any

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,770
dependencies say there is no

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,710
distribution you just can't run up get

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,140
something don't work and so you were

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,930
spending hours of hours to just gather

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,750
your dependencies say back then I

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,220
stumbled by out KN windows KT and

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,309
Windows has a go to bring carry

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,440
applications to Windows so I think it's

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:38,730
a good idea as not everyone has a

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:41,489
possibility to use Linux at work but the

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:44,219
applications are still amazing say it's

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:50,670
nice to have them and there are a lot of

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:53,399
users out there say yeah back then there

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:56,280
was to be used and it developed over the

00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:00,420
years and become bit more capable of

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:04,699
doing things say if you can't going to

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,699
install it it's pretty easy

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,580
it will use a pre-compiled cash nowadays

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:18,060
say you can either build from source or

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,070
directly use the cash we support

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,799
multiple compilers and the good thing is

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:27,840
we not only available on Windows we also

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:30,240
support Mac nowadays so it's not that

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:35,700
well defined there as it is on Windows

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:38,790
but it does work and in the end you are

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,490
able to not only build your application

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:45,840
of Windows you can also package it say

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:50,149
we have back-end for creating classical

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,149
windows installers but also support for

00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:57,479
the windows the Microsoft Store say

00:01:54,470 --> 00:02:00,119
since two months at Academy I talked

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:03,509
about it now it's possible we have Kate

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:08,880
in the Windows Store and not only Kate

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:12,090
also some other applications and we're

00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,100
quite successful in terms of KT for

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:17,519
Windows at least say we have a few

00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,530
applications on this door and since kate

00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:22,440
is in there for two months now and we

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:25,470
got ten thousand acquisitions in two

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,680
months say that's a lot and I mean your

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:31,230
applications probably also amazing and

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,450
just saying I don't care for this other

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:36,329
platform is a bad idea you should try to

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:41,790
to make it available there so we have

00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:43,350
basically all the Penzias of you need

00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,630
for cute applications or for KT

00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:49,320
applications I have no idea what the

00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:50,850
current state of gnome on Windows is it

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:55,049
would be amazing to have those

00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:59,400
applications there - yeah it's easy to

00:02:55,049 --> 00:03:07,519
use and open source man yeah just take

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:07,519
some time to set up say yeah that's it

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,099
