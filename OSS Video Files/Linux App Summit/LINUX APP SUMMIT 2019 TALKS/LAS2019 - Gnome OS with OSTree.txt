okay I will talk about the Phenom OS so

00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:10,200
just to die for what numerous is a the

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:12,300
release team of Noma along when they

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,210
make a release they also in some time

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,480
build the run tempo for flat pack but

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:21,750
they also build a bootable image know

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,550
that we call yomo s this bootable image

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,400
is very useful for doing integration

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,289
testing for the release it's also useful

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,840
for making new screenshots things that

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:33,120
you cannot do by waiting for the

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,350
distribution to actually have your

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,969
release because you need to do the

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:41,760
release before the distribution which is

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:44,969
on the problem was so you might ask what

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,829
is this bootable image based on it's not

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:49,829
based on a distribution it's based on

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:54,239
the free desktop SDK like the runtime of

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:56,329
flat pack so it's a same build but that

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,460
means that this image didn't have any

00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:05,670
package management so it's not quite a

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,930
bowl so that means that if you if you

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,760
set up an image with the configuration

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,470
for doing your test that means that you

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,610
will lose the test voice on you release

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:17,189
because you cannot just update so I made

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,890
some changes for that so it's not yet on

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:22,130
the on the long build meta but it will

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,409
be soon

00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:28,680
that adds support for OS 3 what is OS 3

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:32,400
OS 3 is like get but for operating

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:35,640
systems and that allow us to do atomic

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,619
updates of the operating system so now I

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:44,250
will launch up Nomo s in the virtual

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:52,950
machine so not that we put with systemd

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:55,020
boot on efi we have the most splash so

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,840
this is just experimental for the month

00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:02,280
s these things normally in this image

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,439
the first boot you will have the some

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:10,220
first boot configuration but i already

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:13,920
booted this machine to to go faster so

00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:17,250
what we didn't see maybe in this is a

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:21,780
so we use Primus system these systemd

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:26,900
boots and rackets and also OS 3 that we

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:29,220
shall soon I will go with gnome software

00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:32,780
but by the way this is flat up you can

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:36,780
install pad back on this genome OS

00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:40,860
update we look for an update so behind

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:45,630
that this uses eus updater so this is

00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:47,730
from endless OS to manage the update for

00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,650
RS 3 so it has an integration with new

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:55,140
bloom software so soon we will see that

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:58,980
there is an update that is ready there

00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,630
is some bugs obvious bloom master yes so

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:04,890
we will download it it will be very

00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:06,360
quick the militia is notification when

00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:10,140
there is an update that will tell you oh

00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,390
you have enough that but here I'm not

00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:16,320
going to wait like an hour to get wait

00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:18,269
for the notification so soon is there so

00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,450
this update is very small that I've done

00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:26,579
here if you remember in the splash the

00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:28,799
bloom logo was horizontal logo and I

00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:30,390
will switch it to a vertical logo so

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,329
when I will restart first it would be

00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,920
the splash for the the the shutting down

00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:36,630
that means that this is all logo and

00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:42,000
when we restart we will see the new logo

00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:44,310
and and of course this updates even the

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,709
any trauma fests and everything so if

00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:52,250
you see now this is a vertical logo

00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:52,250
anyway that's it

00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:59,150
