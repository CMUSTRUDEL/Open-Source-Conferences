hello everyone so yes let's talk about

00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:09,000
writing an email graphical interface

00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:12,210
Russell so this morning you had to talk

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,730
about tough economics and I heard users

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:18,449
should receive the value of what you're

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:20,490
doing so if you're gonna write a if you

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:23,910
could report something to us the users

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:26,849
will perceive no no no value that

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,640
doesn't sound very good also holding

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:32,610
something to us it's called oxidation in

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,590
other words burning things yeah also

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,230
doesn't sound very popular so what am i

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,600
doing well that's what there are other

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,670
motivations than money in this case in

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,180
scratching my itch or just having a bit

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,219
of fun

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:49,800
I wrote a email client out of an example

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,570
for was to keep fighting generator the

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,489
was provided we generated as a project

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,899
of mine to let you write real

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:57,210
applications

00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:00,000
graphical user application requests and

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,190
cute and I've had a long interest in was

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,330
I really like the language so I wanted

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:13,950
to yeah write some code in there so oh

00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:16,530
yeah I'm home I click up to get some

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,590
attention for my for my binding

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,060
generator I was writing blog posts and

00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:23,640
the first one was just introducing the

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,759
the framework the second one was a very

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,299
simple example rust and qml a timely

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:32,820
example in which i show how to write a

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,799
 with picking hand that's kind of a

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,250
tradition in KDE it's a hello the

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,670
graphical hello world of KD is a clock

00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:46,380
and the second one was how to do to-do

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:49,049
list in rust here and was just a list of

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,600
items so it's still fairly simple user

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,280
interface and I wanted to really show

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,460
the power of what you can do with you so

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,770
I thought more elaborate user interface

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,719
well that's a three year ages and web

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:04,680
application typically has a three rigid

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,390
while my face of the email client so why

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,550
not just write a small note client

00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,190
purely for writing and illustrating a

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,599
blog

00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,710
cameo is my inspiration is my daily

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,950
email client

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:19,110
and here's a screenshot of Kano and near

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,610
the screenshot of what I have ended up

00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,990
with so far

00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:37,260
so you can see it's fairly similar and

00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:38,850
that's all for wedding so if you want to

00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,950
write an email client a trust there are

00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:43,230
many crates you can just reuse so great

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,900
into system and as of this week there's

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,930
even a email working group in rust so

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:53,160
it's gonna be even better and rust

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:56,460
itself is a pleasantly and language the

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,560
program is called a male model it's you

00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,770
can build up the cargo you can find it

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,780
on the on the crate repository you if

00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,990
there's a port to it which is

00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,700
independent of acute that's actually 90%

00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:12,090
of the throat is just how to deal with

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:16,080
email and then the qml UI on top of it

00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:20,220
and it's very well possible to add for

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,500
example a gtk UI or convert on applique

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:28,980
these or other user interfaces that work

00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:32,280
with red rust on topical you can browse

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,950
a meal directory you can browse a map it

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,110
shows text and HTML it does equip ssin

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,240
what you can't really do is get your

00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,010
email a pop and you can't send you know

00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,860
yet that's the next big feature I

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:46,410
already have to user interface for it so

00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,300
far I'm just reading emails and I feel

00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:52,410
like I'm being silenced

00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:54,660
okay so yeah what are the results from

00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,100
this tiny experiment to me it was an

00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,110
awesome development experience I think

00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,120
was just a great language and the

00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,170
bindings okay I wrote in myself but that

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,330
pretty cool as well

00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:08,160
the performance is extreme and that's

00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:11,460
something I'm gonna demo quickly so you

00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,430
just came in and I'm gonna open the

00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:25,410
folder with the KD frameworks nails and

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:26,750
that has sixty thousand emails in it now

00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:30,680
this is loaded from

00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:33,710
cash so Katy cash is all this to make it

00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:38,110
faster but it's counting BAM well I went

00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:42,290
it was like five seconds okay now

00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:43,640
there's no application let me briefly

00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:47,510
check if I'm actually running it in

00:04:43,640 --> 00:05:04,160
release mode if I'm running it in debug

00:04:47,510 --> 00:05:12,410
mode it would be a bit slow demo coming

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:16,790
up then we're coming up okay

00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:20,169
ah okay well to see the demo just come

00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,169
to my laptop it goes like this

00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:29,680
