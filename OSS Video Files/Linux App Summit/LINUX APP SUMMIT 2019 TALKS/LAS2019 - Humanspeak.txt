Dart I don't really think a super useful

00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,830
conversation but just finding a model

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:10,110
and sort of putting it to practice kind

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,110
of works pretty well so I'm gonna talk

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,660
about one that one specific model I

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,960
think is pretty simple and effective

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,630
it's a Charles Pierce's triatic semiotic

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,099
model so in this model there are

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,300
basically three elements to any sort of

00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:30,830
communication that might might happen it

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:35,329
can be a stop sign it can be you know

00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:40,559
signage on the street really anything so

00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:43,440
there's a representation that is the

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,059
symbol or the form that you're you're

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,719
creating or sending to the user this can

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:52,610
be an icon this can be a picture or

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:55,170
photo and the example I showed before

00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,610
there's different symbols for bananas

00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,710
there is purple they're different

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:02,989
symbols for poses banana there was the

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,989
word I should go back

00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,910
anvil stands for so that is sort of

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:14,720
is this and that that's actually where

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:18,480
the user lives and the context is and so

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:21,330
things can change a lot based on the

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,910
user's understanding or experiences so

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,350
you may want a symbol to represent you

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:29,700
know this particular thing and you might

00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:31,890
want to you know communicate to them you

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,690
know a phone but they might look at it

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,970
and say well that to me is just a banana

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:40,200
because I've never seen anybody talk to

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:43,280
a banana and me no phone so that is

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,620
where it becomes very important to

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,630
understand who your users are what are

00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,840
their contexts what are the contexts

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:54,030
that they're going to be coming across

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,580
your software and what is their base set

00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:01,110
of experiences in which they understand

00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:03,000
things so I really think a lot of what

00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,980
I'm going through this process of this

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,870
particular part of the triangle the

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,780
interpret the interpreting or the

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,100
signified this is the context this is

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,260
the user this is their understanding

00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:17,120
this is sort of the world in which

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:20,760
they're operating in that this that your

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:26,459
your experience is going to be perceived

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:29,269
in so yeah understanding users context

00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:29,269
and experience is

00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:40,340
countered a phone at one point there

00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,810
I guess Muppets from Mars and they were

00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,700
struggling for a while to figure out

00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:47,150
like what this thing actually is so

00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:49,130
they've cycled through cat and cow and

00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:52,340
then it rained and they're like oh yeah

00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:54,290
it's a phone so that's a really good

00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,880
video you can click on it later if you

00:03:54,290 --> 00:04:00,200
want to I'm not gonna try because it'll

00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:02,540
probably break okay so now we're gonna

00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:06,590
refocus again to how all of this relates

00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:08,120
to software I like to break down the

00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:12,110
ways that we communicate with our users

00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:15,350
to four main areas there's probably more

00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:18,709
other other designers break them out

00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:21,829
more and differently but this seems to

00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:25,300
work so the four main areas I see are

00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:27,919
engaging how do we engage our users to

00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:31,310
kind of like move through our software

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:33,680
experiences to click on calls to action

00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:37,250
and to be inspired to continue to use

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,390
your software then there's informing so

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,750
what are the different language

00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:43,760
breadcrumbs that we can use to leave the

00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,550
users through the experience and avoid

00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,500
confusion or let them know like what is

00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:51,410
the status of things or what exactly is

00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,540
going on another important one that I

00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:56,270
think is always challenging and often

00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:58,190
overlooked is how do we gather feedback

00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:01,610
from the user

00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:05,030
communication as we know at its best is

00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:07,090
a two-way street and so without that

00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:10,400
feedback from the user it's sort of just

00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:13,280
one-way communication so I think that

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,260
this is always a really important thing

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,350
to think about when we're building

00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:24,919
software experience and then the fourth

00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:27,260
one is when happens like fail and

00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:29,630
we want to think about how we can build

00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:35,000
checks and balances into our software so

00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:36,800
that we can and avoid pain in it for our

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,020
users and help get them back on track

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,440
more quickly

00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:44,479
so I'm gonna so now I'm gonna dive in a

00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,580
little bit to each of the four areas and

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,700
kind of give really simple case studies

00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,740
for each I think that

00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,870
you know the case studies can be but you

00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,890
know it can be broken down a lot further

00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:59,380
but I don't you ever help a lot of time

00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:01,990
so in the first area engagement it's

00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,400
kind of like you know the maybe the

00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:06,460
first and the most important because we

00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,770
want people to get to your experience

00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:10,450
and be really excited to use it and once

00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:12,550
they use it you know keep going through

00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,440
the flows and continue to use it you

00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:17,890
know and if you you lose them through

00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:20,230
the sort of out of the box or first run

00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:24,040
then you know you've you failed in the

00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:25,960
engagement experience so a big part of

00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,000
this is how do you indicate who use

00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:31,930
actions that are available to them and

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,970
encourage them to interact this think

00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,980
here is it's actually something I saw

00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:38,490
when I was just walking around this

00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:41,830
neighborhood it's a door knocker and

00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:46,570
what I really liked about it is it's

00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:48,730
this object that it maps to what its

00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,650
purpose is and it like it's how it lets

00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:52,030
you know like this is for knocking on

00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,330
the door and here you can knock on the

00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:58,120
door this and it invites you to knock on

00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:00,790
the door which I was curious too but I

00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,420
didn't because I didn't know who was

00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:07,690
there

00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:11,200
I don't speak Catalan so I skipped it so

00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:14,470
how does this apply to software so a

00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:17,160
good idea for a user engagement is maybe

00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:19,360
greeting your users directly and

00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,810
suggesting things that they can do in

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,070
the interface so in facebook they

00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:26,410
suggest you like hey how's it going like

00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:29,080
what's on your mind and people will

00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:30,880
literally tell the world everything

00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,690
that's on their mind whether you want to

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,930
know or not but it's it's effective and

00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:39,400
then in the case of forms and fields

00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:42,220
it's also really good to provide a

00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,960
specific examples of the types of things

00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:47,440
that you're you're you're looking for

00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:52,780
them to input Siri is another really

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:56,130
good example as you're it she leads you

00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:58,240
through the process she will suggest you

00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:00,820
different things that you can ask her

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,680
different things that you can you can do

00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:05,139
to interact with it

00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,250
so that's always really helpful because

00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:08,259
if you're getting used to that

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,960
experience and not quite comfortable

00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:12,940
with engaging it it kind of like leaves

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:18,070
you in and sort of introduces you to

00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:19,780
that experience okay here's a bad idea

00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:22,870
so this is something you don't want to

00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:25,210
do to engage your users shaming your

00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:29,050
users into choosing your desired action

00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:30,880
flow is probably a bad idea or shaming

00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:34,240
them to opt into your product or service

00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,070
is probably a bad idea so this one it's

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,959
like shaming people for not joining

00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,180
their health app like it's kind of a

00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:44,800
bummer like no thanks I like to not make

00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:47,399
bad choices another one is get the

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,620
latest travel news flight fields and

00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:53,529
there's like luck my exclusive content

00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,790
or no thanks I'm a homebody like that's

00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:56,410
that doesn't feel too good

00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,959
so there's probably better ways to

00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:03,190
engage your users into trying out your

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:05,440
service or opting into your content okay

00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,000
we're going to talk about informing kind

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,260
of being really brief in each of these

00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,740
areas so how do you keep your users

00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:16,900
apprised of important system States

00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:19,300
contacts changes progress or status

00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:23,650
without spamming them unnecessarily or

00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:28,110
creating anxiety or fear with by sort of

00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:31,420
all of the excess information this was

00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:34,029
something I saw I was seeing these signs

00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,220
all over London last week a danger of

00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:38,140
death and they were kind of like

00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,670
scattered all throughout the city and I

00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,070
guess it was kind of nice information to

00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:45,310
know because I don't want to die but it

00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:47,560
looks very extreme and I'm I'm really

00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:49,540
curious in all of those areas if the

00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,029
dead like if there was serious danger of

00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:54,160
death this one if it was particularly

00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:56,560
interesting because in addition to the

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,230
actual sign there's also barbed wire

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,870
which I think probably has a functional

00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:05,079
purpose but it also is an effective

00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:07,120
symbol for like you don't when you

00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:10,300
probably shouldn't cross here and it's a

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:13,600
bad idea and kind of go away so it's

00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:17,680
kind of like a layering of people's

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:20,139
so how do we apply this to software so a

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,350
good idea that's generally good is

00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:26,740
revealing how far along they are in a

00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:30,550
workflow or how far along a process has

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:33,069
to go that uploads or downloads so you

00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:36,180
know if you're gonna have to wait a long

00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:39,009
time for a video to upload or a video to

00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:41,589
decode then you know it's nice to see a

00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:44,130
progress bar or in the case of Vimeo

00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:47,860
they kind of even had kind of a clever

00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:50,199
like perfectly it feel a little more

00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:52,930
personable like your video will start

00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:54,940
converting soon if you have other things

00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:58,660
to do besides stare at the screen you

00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:00,040
can leave I mean I don't know different

00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:03,550
people have different opinions about

00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,709
making like cheeky commentary like that

00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:07,899
in microcopy

00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:10,660
I'll talk briefly a little bit later

00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:12,490
about tone and kind of like when it's

00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,019
really when it's when it's right to be

00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:16,120
cheeky and when you should be just so

00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:18,579
straightforward and serious but I think

00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,620
in this instance it works pretty well

00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:22,750
I think another area that this is really

00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,730
important is sort of steps in a flow

00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:27,310
that sort of lead to something like

00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,079
purchasing you know a user wants to know

00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,120
like okay how much more information do I

00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:32,680
need to give and at what point am I

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,569
actually going to be charged for

00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:41,500
something you know it's it's a little

00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:43,779
bit under an online field so kind of

00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,579
knowing when like okay like this is

00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:47,829
where I give you my home address info

00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:50,829
and now is where I'm giving you my

00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:52,660
credit card info and now you know I'm

00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:56,350
going to be charged so I think that

00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:58,449
having markers that indicate that flow

00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:01,500
is really helpful and I mean I think

00:11:58,449 --> 00:12:04,750
also it's helpful anytime there's a

00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:07,810
complicated multi-step process in a flow

00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:10,170
to keep users are prize to how much more

00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,620
they have to go

00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:14,230
[Music]

00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,090
well this one I just this is another

00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,490
good idea I didn't give a bad idea for

00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:20,590
this one I think that it's a really good

00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:23,350
idea to have useful empty states

00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:26,260
especially when the useful empty states

00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:29,410
can help onboard your users into core

00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:32,470
functionality and actions so I like the

00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:35,680
one up above where it says hmm that's

00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:37,330
like it's empty you have no projects but

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,530
it's actually pointing you to the button

00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,600
that you need to click in order to

00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:42,970
create a product project so I think

00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,730
that's pretty cool because it's like you

00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:48,700
know even the character is kind of

00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:51,610
pointing you up there and then in this

00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,860
case of this app called drafts like

00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:56,410
there's these cute little empty states

00:12:53,860 --> 00:13:03,190
and it I mean there's a button that's

00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:03,970
pretty clear what you need to do let's

00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,040
see okay

00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:08,200
gathering feedback I think that this is

00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,690
a really interesting one it's probably

00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:14,320
one of the hardest for a lot of ways I

00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:17,610
think that you know in terms of privacy

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,830
in terms of sort of having like two-way

00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:22,450
communications from your users in from a

00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:25,300
technical standpoint from a metric

00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:28,510
standpoint it's always a little bit more

00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:31,150
challenging to gather feedback from the

00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:33,520
users but it can be really helpful in

00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:37,750
order to continue to improve your

00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:39,520
software experiences and I think that

00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,100
it's really important to find ways to

00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:44,830
gain insights from your users in ways

00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:47,170
that are lightweight and encourages

00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:49,150
users to communicate in the right

00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,790
moments without interrupting their

00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:55,540
workflow err I like bogging them down

00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:59,110
and kind of slowing slowing slowing

00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:02,470
their work down unnecessarily so this is

00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:05,050
this example here is like a kiosk that

00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:07,030
I've seen at airports kind of all over

00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:09,820
the world I think I've been seeing them

00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:12,700
at a lot of different places and I

00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:14,890
actually saw one here in Barcelona

00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,360
coming in and I wish I was I wish I

00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:18,970
check I wish she was able to take a

00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,290
video of of this site and use that as

00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,350
the case study but that probably

00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:25,509
wouldn't have been nice but

00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:27,579
there's a guy who is clearly displeased

00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:30,370
with the what at whatever experience he

00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:32,649
had and he was just pounding the unhappy

00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:35,529
button over and over and over again so I

00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:37,360
think that this that actually served a

00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:39,009
couple of purposes I think that maybe

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,690
you know it was giving some good

00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:42,639
feedback to the airports that they

00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,709
weren't doing the best job but I think

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,589
that it also helped him feel like he was

00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:50,529
heard in some ways and provided a little

00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:52,569
bit of catharsis for an unpleasant

00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:56,920
experience so he was clearly getting

00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:58,839
some satisfaction so you know like like

00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:02,500
silver linings or something like that I

00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:06,190
don't know so you know user feedback can

00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:10,290
be you know a emotive catharsis for

00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:10,290
people I mean if you just look at Yelp

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,839
this is a lady that most people won't

00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:18,970
provide Yelp reviews unless they have

00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:21,990
had a bad experience but they'll you

00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:28,510
know have lots of great experiences and

00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:30,670
not review them so let's see okay so

00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:34,029
gathering feedback a good idea this is

00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:36,130
one of my favorite case studies I really

00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:40,569
like what lyft is doing to gather

00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:43,060
feedback from users about rides and in

00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:45,370
this case this good ideas encouraging

00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:48,220
specific feedback through very simple

00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:51,550
prompts and the key word here is simple

00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:53,889
or in the queue your specific feedback

00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:56,829
with simple prompts and in the right

00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:58,810
context and then also reverting the

00:15:56,829 --> 00:16:00,940
users feedback through delightful

00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:03,100
interactions so there's a couple things

00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:05,260
that are going on here one of them is

00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,779
you know lyft is it's you know it's a

00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,579
ride share app so like obviously finding

00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:11,260
the right moment to ask for feedback is

00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:13,000
really important because if you ask for

00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,990
it at the wrong time then you know

00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,389
people are sort of like shuffling

00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:18,579
luggage or running across the street or

00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:21,970
doing other things that are probably

00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:25,089
more polka more important than providing

00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:26,889
feedback to an app so if they're really

00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:28,959
good about asking for feedback when

00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:30,759
you're just sitting there in the car

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:34,300
probably doing nothing or checking

00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:35,560
Twitter or whatever else so they'll ask

00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,089
you like

00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,360
some very specific things like sometimes

00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:42,550
it's how is the pickup or how is your

00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,290
route you know and that's a big one when

00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:46,300
you do like the rideshare thing like

00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:49,089
sometimes the routes are really good and

00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,889
sometimes the route - really bad so in

00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:53,439
this case you know this they were asking

00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:54,999
me about how it's a pickup and there's

00:16:53,439 --> 00:16:57,069
three options so I don't have to like

00:16:54,999 --> 00:16:58,449
think too hard about like you know I

00:16:57,069 --> 00:16:59,589
don't have to write an essay about it

00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:01,839
like okay

00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:04,179
in this case like it was alright like it

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,579
wasn't any you know it wasn't great and

00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:08,470
it's like it gave me some simple options

00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:11,260
about okay like what wasn't great about

00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:13,510
it and again I don't have to like write

00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,549
it in or think too hard I'm just you

00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:18,429
know there's there's a couple of general

00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:18,970
options and I told them okay it's the

00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:21,339
wrong spot

00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:25,209
I had to like walk and find the driver

00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:27,220
and then you know I wasn't really upset

00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:30,010
like I guess I wasn't in a huge rush and

00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:32,159
like it wasn't terrible but there was

00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:36,940
this cute little animation with like

00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:39,159
turtles and bunnies hopping that kind of

00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,720
like made any irritation that I had

00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:44,520
about the pickup just kind of like float

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:47,380
away because you know it's pretty cute

00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:51,100
they apologized and I accepted their

00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,870
apology was great and I felt heard which

00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,360
is also great so you know don't make

00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:58,600
your users work too hard in order to

00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:01,809
give you feedback solicit very specific

00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:04,870
feedback because you'll you'll probably

00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:07,840
get game better insights but your users

00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:11,100
won't have as much cognitive folks if in

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,179
terms of like thinking of what to write

00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:17,789
okay here's the VIS ones a really

00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:21,240
important ones bad idea I think is I

00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:24,460
think asking for sensitive information

00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:28,059
without kind of providing like

00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:29,980
reasonable purposes for it is usually a

00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:31,480
bad idea you want if you want to ask for

00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,309
sensitive information you want to tell

00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,500
them like okay like what are you going

00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:37,480
to do with my information and that's

00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,980
pretty clear but also you know some of

00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,140
this sensitive information is very

00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:45,390
personal and and if you're going to ask

00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,390
like you need to provide ink

00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:15,779
best and you know they're usually pretty

00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:17,640
bad these aren't real error states but

00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:20,039
this is what happens when Daily Show

00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,720
writers discover UX writing and they

00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:24,480
sort of like made up these air States

00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,789
for Disney and it's pretty funny

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:33,240
I don't think that they're good for kids

00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:35,700
but so good ideas for air States let's

00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,740
help our users fail gently and ease the

00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:40,500
frustration of software error errors by

00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:44,370
providing useful and maybe even

00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:47,279
delightful errors and 404s but in the

00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:50,520
best worlds errors should address three

00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:52,770
main points what was the problem why is

00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,750
it why did it happen and how do you

00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:56,220
solve it how do you move forward you

00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,990
know and so in both of these cases like

00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,429
MailChimp is really great about a lot of

00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,950
this stuff like if there's something

00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:04,260
wrong in the entry form they're really

00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:06,750
specific about was it your user name was

00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:10,500
it you know something else and they give

00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:14,399
you a prompt to help you around that in

00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:16,860
the case of this Lego website it gives

00:20:14,399 --> 00:20:18,419
you a suggestion to go back to the lego

00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,850
home page instead of just like sitting

00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:25,770
there looking at a 404 and it's a you

00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:28,740
know pretty cute illustration bad ideas

00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:31,830
for air States I mean there's as many

00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:34,140
bad ideas as there are errors so and I'm

00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:36,870
sure we're all very familiar with them

00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:39,990
but I think you know among the the top

00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:41,610
40 s of them are providing insufficient

00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:45,059
or intelligible air state information

00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:49,110
that puts you into infinite loops of of

00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:51,419
sadness in the case of forms providing

00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:54,510
in some intimate insufficient formatting

00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:57,419
hints that cause errors are missing info

00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:58,740
so you know if it's like kind of you

00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:02,100
need if you need to type in your phone

00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:03,870
number and they want it just so but the

00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:06,000
sort of formatting fields that help you

00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:07,620
along to do that and then you just sit

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,409
there having like errors over and over

00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:13,919
again trying to fill in a form that's

00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:16,289
pretty annoying okay so what makes good

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,020
microcopy now we talked about it good

00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:21,510
microcopy is clear concise and

00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:24,429
ultimately useful good microcopy

00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:25,960
accounts for context and

00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:26,410
it's really good to know when to be

00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,490
funny

00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:32,650
friendly cheeky serious you know you

00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:35,980
don't want your bank to be like making

00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:37,780
jokes with you but you know I mean like

00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,669
MailChimp some of these others they you

00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:41,799
know they're big they kind of build a

00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:43,690
rapport with you users and I think it

00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:48,429
can be nice and you have to know when

00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:50,350
and you kind of be careful there this is

00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:52,660
just the tip of the iceberg in terms of

00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:55,720
my group coffee and painting with your

00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:57,100
users I encourage everybody as they sort

00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,710
of like move through the world and

00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:02,110
experience various products and software

00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:04,030
to sort of take note of what are some

00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:06,220
great experiences and when you're

00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:07,960
communicating with your software or the

00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:10,120
software is communicating with you and

00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,730
also what is some bad experiences and

00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,799
try to understand a little bit about why

00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:17,380
because then you can kind of apply those

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,480
learnings to the software experiences

00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:21,659
that you yourself are creating and we

00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:28,510
can hopefully make the world a happier

00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:32,020
