[Applause]

00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:10,710
thank you I was unsure when I submitted

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:15,030
my paper to this conference whether it

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:17,880
really belongs here but then again good

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,670
officer this integral part of good

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:26,180
desktop experience and it will probably

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:29,609
stay that way for long time to come I

00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:32,040
usually like my next slide is my vanity

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,870
slide but I made an exception today and

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,840
I would like to use this opportunity to

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,940
thank the organizers of this conference

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,640
to making this conference very diverse

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:46,530
and not only very gender diverse but

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,090
also very colorful so I spilled the

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,309
beans already I'm a Libra office

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,399
developer I'm one of the people who

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:56,460
brought the KDE plasma integration to

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,910
you but no way I want to make an

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:03,290
impression that I'm the only one all

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:08,479
those folks contributed either code or

00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:10,470
testing or endless effort to triage bugs

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,869
unfortunately none of them is here today

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,450
but maybe they're watching online so

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:20,240
maybe we can give them some small round

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,240
of applause thank you

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:29,460
yes LibreOffice on Kady plasma

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:32,909
I mean so some things I will be saying

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:35,850
here or in fact most of the things are

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,270
are not specific to libreoffice service

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:41,369
if you have any cross-platform

00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:43,680
application that already works on I

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:45,930
don't know Windows and Mac and you want

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,240
to bring it to the Linux platform you

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,990
will probably have to go through many of

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,670
the steps I'm outlining here not all the

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,930
steps some of them are specific to

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,729
libreoffice but many of them aren't so

00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:03,570
first of all we will look what does it

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:04,950
mean in fact when we say if the software

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,950
is multi-platform

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,899
what basic functionality we have to

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,930
implement when we want to integrate it

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,860
to the other platform then not so basic

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:21,570
functional

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:24,270
tea some nice-to-haves and so I presume

00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:26,870
everybody now spoke labor offices

00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:31,050
there's nobody who who would not know Oh

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:34,590
what service is the best free and open

00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:37,260
source of a suit out there and the

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,570
foundation that sustains and supports

00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,780
labor office is called the document

00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:44,700
foundation that libre office is not the

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,959
only project under the roof of the

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,080
document foundation

00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:53,070
the other one is document liberation

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:56,550
project which brings the set of filters

00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:59,220
to the users that enable them to to

00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:02,070
import the documents from many legacy

00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:07,560
formats and save them in the open

00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:11,790
formats so when did it all start it all

00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:14,730
started in 1984 when abroad dude named

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:17,520
Marco berries created a word processor

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:20,790
for his 8-bit computer this word

00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:24,120
processor was called star writer and he

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:26,220
later built a successful company around

00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,320
this word processor then added a

00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,780
spreadsheet application and presentation

00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,930
application to the fourth portfolio and

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,510
the company was so successful that in

00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:39,959
1999 it got acquired by Sun Microsystems

00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:42,420
and urban legend has it that for Sun

00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,510
Microsystems it was cheaper to buy the

00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:49,350
company than to buy Microsoft Office

00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:52,590
licenses for everybody after the

00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:54,600
acquisition Sun Microsystems open

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,769
sourced the product that was called star

00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:00,680
office and renamed it to OpenOffice and

00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:05,519
released his first version OpenOffice

00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:07,620
1.0 in 2002 and then the life was nice

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,640
and then the in the LibreOffice landfill

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:15,269
for the couple of years until Oracle

00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:19,440
bought Sun Microsystems and eventually

00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:21,690
in 2011 Oracle disconnected opens office

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,990
and donated the source code to the

00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:27,660
Apache foundation and light of all the

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:31,440
developers and contributors that were

00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:34,830
employed by sun microsystems but before

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,920
all of this happened in 2010 a group of

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:42,870
concerned community contributors said

00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:44,820
enough is enough and kind of stood up

00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:48,030
against what they perceived as the

00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:52,460
corporate overlords and fork the project

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:55,860
and renamed it to libre office nowadays

00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:58,680
OpenOffice somehow struggles to get even

00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:02,040
elementary security bugs fix while

00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:06,030
LibreOffice has a very vibrant very

00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:08,580
lively contributed community and user

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:11,550
community several companies that provide

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,980
commercial support and it's used by

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:17,340
organizations and companies worldwide

00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:20,550
and then to complete the efforts of the

00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:23,130
fork in 2012 the document foundation

00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:29,070
that supports LibreOffice the nonprofit

00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:31,500
entity was established so LibreOffice is

00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:34,620
a multi-platform software but what does

00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:38,720
that mean well that it runs on multiple

00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:41,550
platforms multiple operating systems and

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,830
the operating systems officially

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,270
supported by the document foundation are

00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,780
three its Linux

00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:51,600
that's Windows and that's Mac what does

00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:54,540
this mean is that document foundation

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,590
ships the binaries and packages for

00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:02,910
those three platforms daily and provides

00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:05,220
official releases twice a year then

00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:07,260
there's also of course plethora of Linux

00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:10,620
distributions that take the source code

00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:13,680
and package and improve it on their own

00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,660
terms and there's a couple of non

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,660
official platforms maintained by

00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:24,930
volunteers mostly on unix-like operating

00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:27,590
systems such as FreeBSD and haiku so

00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:31,530
since we are on Linux application summit

00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:36,710
how does it look on Linux does it look

00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:36,710
like this one front end to rule them all

00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,990
unfortunately or maybe luckily it

00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,900
doesn't

00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:47,010
because we can have both or maybe all

00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:49,000
three of them so on linux platform

00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:53,800
libreoffice comes with three different

00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,930
contents the one of them is very legacy

00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,840
very old and very ugly and it looks like

00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:03,010
Windows 95

00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:06,130
hardly anybody uses it today then we

00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:08,680
have the gtk based integration into

00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:11,820
gnome desktop environment and then the

00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,830
cute based integrations into KDE desktop

00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:18,580
environment techno mint aggression was

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:22,150
started like on GT k2 by Michael mix

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:26,140
later ported to GT k3 and brought to

00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:28,870
perfection by kweilyn mcnamara cute

00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:32,530
katie integrations started about the

00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:37,690
same time by Yunho leash off ski was

00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:39,540
later ported to KDE 4 unfortunately and

00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:44,260
I will talk about it later

00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:47,860
we couldn't simply take the KDE 4 code

00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:50,440
and ported to KF 5 it was not possible

00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:53,380
so we had to write it from scratch and

00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:57,700
the intermediate step happened in

00:07:53,380 --> 00:08:02,260
LibreOffice 6 1 in 2017 when we still

00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:04,480
had the GDK user interface and over that

00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:08,350
like some elementary integration of

00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:12,880
plasma file picker done by million wolf

00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:15,640
and later into the at the end of 2017

00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:20,860
first cute base proof of concept was

00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:22,780
developed by an America of scheme so if

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:26,170
we have a multi-platform code as it

00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:29,980
usually look like this like do we have

00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:32,020
like loads of if thefts and and do

00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:34,990
we need to like really be proficient to

00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:38,160
write the code that's specific on for

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:41,200
for all the platforms we have to support

00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:44,200
unfortunately not we have like high

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,410
level api's so if I want to write the

00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,960
word processor code I can just say yes I

00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:53,710
can write a generic code it's like opens

00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,690
a dialogue or opens the file picker and

00:08:53,710 --> 00:09:00,370
like sets the filter on the file picker

00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:03,790
to show me only text files and then what

00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:06,100
happens on the on the right side of the

00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:11,320
screen that like this is some high level

00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:13,660
API system abstraction and it gets rated

00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:17,459
in this code specific for that platform

00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:20,800
so on Windows it's some windows API on

00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:23,170
the gtk front end that's this with gtk

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,300
and yes of course like the new cute

00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:30,700
front end does it with using the leap

00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:32,709
cute yeah this is just like another I I

00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,870
called the lady like in the Opera I

00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:37,450
called her Sally instance but it's

00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:39,220
something like Siri so if you write a

00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,680
generic code you just say like because

00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,750
like the class is called Sal instance in

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,370
LibreOffice so I so you can say selling

00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:49,180
instance please open the window for me

00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:51,760
or please create a file picker and Sally

00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:57,190
instance either does this or delegates

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:59,589
to do somebody who can do it so and if I

00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,750
talk about platform dependent bits if I

00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:06,910
talk about platform integration what do

00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:09,580
I mean well basically like I divided

00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:13,000
those like set of functionalities into

00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:15,160
two categories basic which like we can't

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,920
do without it this is an absolute must

00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:21,400
must be done and some extended

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:26,950
functionality that is nice to have so we

00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:28,870
should be able to open windows we should

00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,839
be able to put some content into the

00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:34,240
windows and it should have the platform

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,310
specifically can feel so on windows it

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,600
should look like well-behaved decent

00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:41,020
windows application

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,750
similarly on KDE the front-end should

00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:47,980
fit the environment and look like

00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:50,050
well-behaved caddy application of course

00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,690
office suit is like lot about opening

00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:55,540
file saving them so it would be also

00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:57,160
nice to have some KD file picker or I

00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:00,160
don't know windows file picker when

00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,290
we're on Windows well and after all this

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,320
is done then comes the extended

00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:09,340
functionality so usually want to

00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:12,250
copy paste text from stackoverflow they

00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:13,930
want to grab files from the file manager

00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:18,190
and drag and drop it into the

00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:21,850
application this is kind of labor of a

00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:24,310
specific bit which we see in action now

00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:27,160
I have dual screens it's kind of like

00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:29,650
subset of the window manager windows

00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,990
functionality I have a dual screen now

00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:33,880
so because I need to present on both

00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:39,010
screens so I need support for that as

00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:42,940
well yes and then there's much more it's

00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:45,130
quite a lot of work is it so Aaron this

00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:49,570
was my reaction when I when I realized

00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:51,400
like how much work that's released so

00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:55,690
how do we start with a basic

00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:58,960
functionality first step is to put some

00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:01,780
windows on screen why not we need to be

00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:06,490
able to open and close them set their

00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:08,500
size maximize minimize them windows can

00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:11,200
be of many different kinds it can be

00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:14,140
modal dialog it can be motorized

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,470
dialogue it can be the main window it

00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:21,010
can be some kind of floating toolbar it

00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:24,130
can be a tool window it can be a docking

00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:28,680
window so we need to somehow support all

00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:31,660
those family some kinds of windows and

00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:35,620
yes so since we are on view based

00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:38,110
platform we implement those windows and

00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:43,210
dialogues in terms of key windows and

00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:45,910
cue widgets and once done now we have

00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:48,460
tonight.if q windows and q dialogues so

00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:52,060
it means that they receive the native

00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:56,380
cute events such as user move the mouse

00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:58,990
user clicked here user press the key so

00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:02,170
all we have to do is like to take those

00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:06,270
cute events and somehow map them to

00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:06,270
libreoffice internal events

00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:17,930
and so now we have the windows the

00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:22,460
windows respond to the events and it's

00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:25,580
time that we put some content in so

00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:27,770
there are like somehow two ways this can

00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:31,040
be done we have a native window so we

00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:33,830
can put native widgets in but that's

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,860
quite lots of work and writing lots of

00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:40,630
code so we went a simple way and we use

00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:44,240
the cue painter cue style and with this

00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:47,720
painter we kind of draw a bitmap of a

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,960
button of checkbox or any other visit

00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:53,630
and then we simply take it and paste it

00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:56,510
into the into the canvas that represents

00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:59,060
the window and then we repeat this for

00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:02,000
every single widget that's kind of in

00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:06,770
the dialogue or in the window to obtain

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,720
the end result and there are some other

00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:10,940
side effects that we have the native

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,450
windows now one of them is for example

00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:17,510
that the native menus are possible and

00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:21,320
it's too similar to the events once the

00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:24,530
window can support the native menus all

00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,840
we can do is all we have to do is that

00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:31,630
we take the libreoffice menu structure

00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:31,630
and map it to the cute menu structure

00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:39,230
also that was one of the annoying bugs

00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:41,630
that we had with tooltips that were not

00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:44,660
night if it was always major pain in the

00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:47,240
rear to position them correctly and to

00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:51,080
size them correctly with native windows

00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:53,690
the tool kit does this for us so couple

00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,700
of screen shot this is a global menu

00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:58,910
support we which we get with those

00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:01,430
native menus kind of for free its

00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:04,430
feature known I think it first came on

00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:07,220
Mac that the menu is in some kind of

00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:13,630
global menu and it's not embedded in the

00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:17,690
window and this is a bit of work of art

00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:19,550
so this is some old this is a new ribbon

00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,570
like LibreOffice interface is called

00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:23,150
Nobu pie

00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:27,160
but if you notice this tab bar still

00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:30,380
looks like very ugly like Windows 95 and

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:35,750
this is how we did it much better with

00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:39,140
with the cute styling yes so office suit

00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:42,020
is lot of about opening files working on

00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:46,790
them and eventually saving them and for

00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:49,820
that we need a good file picker the so

00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:52,460
well we take the file picker from the

00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:56,170
platform for the KDE plasma platform and

00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:59,270
integrate it into the application I

00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:02,180
mentioned this already the intermediate

00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:04,910
step to this result happened in

00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:09,140
LibreOffice 6-1 where we still had the

00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:11,990
GDK tree user interface and plasma file

00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:14,960
picker as a separate application it was

00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:18,470
a bit of a hack they communicated over

00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:22,160
standard input and standard output but

00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:25,340
the code was there so it was it was done

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:34,760
easy to take this code and move it

00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:38,510
completely to to kf5 content yes you

00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:41,360
hear like similar picture than me then

00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:44,570
we have already seen cell instance that

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:50,300
asked the Jo Jo K file picker to open a

00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:52,970
file picker so yes so what do we do with

00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,580
the file picker well of course open it

00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:57,560
close it when we don't need it anymore

00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:59,270
distinguish the file file picker to open

00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,480
a file looks slightly different than the

00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:05,000
file picker to save a file switch to

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,850
folder set filter like both files do we

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,450
want to see and what we also this is a

00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:14,810
new feature we integrated some access to

00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:19,970
their files on on the remote chairs that

00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:21,650
was previously not possible and yes so

00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,210
there are some features that you some

00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:25,100
things you can do with the file picker

00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:28,000
that are only possible with LibreOffice

00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:32,000
and nothing else and one of them is to

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,720
save the file with the passport or save

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,310
the file

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,120
like encrypt the file with

00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:41,030
jpg' key and for that we have those we

00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:45,170
have those fancy checkboxes or

00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:47,600
eventually list boxes so we have to be

00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:49,910
able to kind of integrate those check

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,640
boxes all these boxes that provide this

00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:54,440
extra functionality to the file picker

00:17:52,640 --> 00:18:01,220
and we need to be able to get and set

00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:05,690
their value yeah so a lot of work is

00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:13,580
done can kind of put the feet up and

00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:15,440
relax right since there is basic

00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,960
functionality got merged into

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,210
LibreOffice master and usually started

00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,390
to download the daily builds and report

00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:26,210
backs so literally one of the first box

00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:31,370
that we got reported I can't copy and

00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:33,410
paste the second back was well I'm

00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:35,750
trying to I'm trying to grab the picture

00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:38,690
from the gallery but I can't drag and

00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:40,940
drop it into the into the applications

00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:44,270
and the news is to like all kinds of

00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,370
things with LibreOffice a LibreOffice

00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:49,610
provides users with the possibility to

00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:52,100
develop extensions we have the

00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:55,190
presentation applications so the users

00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:57,170
create slideshows they put all kinds of

00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:02,360
content into their slideshow such as

00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:05,660
videos animated gives some OpenGL slide

00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:08,150
transitions and what was also missing in

00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:11,390
the in the old what was what is a new

00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:15,020
feature is the accessibility so now the

00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:20,780
the new q25 based interface is is fully

00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:22,850
exposed to the screen readers so yes

00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:25,340
copy and paste

00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:29,000
well there's internal and external copy

00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:32,600
and paste within one application or like

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,990
two from external applications to

00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:39,380
LibreOffice to make things more

00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:42,280
complicated you can paste many kinds of

00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:47,030
data you can paste image pictures well

00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:48,200
text HTML and to make things even more

00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:50,110
complex there

00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:54,139
something like a selection keyboard on

00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:56,330
clipboard on x11 to kind of put the

00:19:54,139 --> 00:20:02,960
highlighted text or highlighted image

00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:05,059
into the into the clipboard yes sir so

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,409
this is how how it was implemented

00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:13,580
internally we use QQ clipboard

00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:15,740
abstraction and and the mime data to to

00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,870
get the content like from one liver of

00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,789
this application to the other but also

00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:23,630
from external applications to

00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:27,470
libreoffice and similar story with

00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:30,289
drag-and-drop began like drag drag and

00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:32,570
drop stuff with in libreoffice but also

00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:35,840
like from externally from the file

00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:37,760
manager or some other text editor and is

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,700
similar to clipboard here we also have

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,889
to keep in mind that the data types we

00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:50,029
drag and drop or copy and paste can be

00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:53,899
of different kind so similarly to copy

00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:59,659
and paste used q mime data abstraction

00:20:53,899 --> 00:21:01,399
and to implement this one of the and

00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:04,279
this is this is kind of libreoffice

00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:06,940
specific bit what libreoffice does is

00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:11,740
that it provides users with the platform

00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:15,919
tools to implement their own extensions

00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:19,240
that means some extra functionality that

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:22,909
doesn't or doesn't belong to the core

00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:25,159
that user can install it like similarly

00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:28,010
to firefox as some kind of additional

00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:30,289
package so if you I don't know want to

00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:33,139
develop an elaborate template management

00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:35,840
system for your organization it makes

00:21:33,139 --> 00:21:38,330
little sense to kind of strive to merge

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,370
it into labor of its core but it makes a

00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:43,159
lot of sense to develop it as your own

00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:46,460
extensions and what extensions typically

00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:50,360
do well what the libreoffice core does

00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:52,639
so need to open and save data or you

00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:55,490
need to open your own user interface or

00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:58,990
you want to ask libreoffice code to open

00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:01,820
some user interface on your behalf so

00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:05,090
yes they access the user interface

00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:07,460
and the problem with cute is that every

00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:10,730
single operation with the user interface

00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:13,670
has to happen in the main threat this

00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:17,450
was a problem we did not think about so

00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:20,360
when this was disposed we did not take

00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:22,040
this into account in our design and then

00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,710
the users were getting all kinds of

00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:29,180
deadlocks and all kinds of weird crashes

00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:35,210
so we had to identify some sticky sticky

00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:39,140
points in the API and and somehow force

00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:42,080
all those operations that access UI that

00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:48,110
operate with you I put them into the

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:51,290
main threat another level of this

00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:56,000
specific bit is yes what I'm doing right

00:22:51,290 --> 00:23:00,370
now is the slide show that can sometimes

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,370
run on multiple screens like right now

00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,280
there can be multimedia content in the

00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:10,130
slideshows which is what we handled like

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,770
through embedded key windows and also

00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:16,490
there can be open GL content in the

00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:19,370
slides and also Open GL can be used to

00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:22,130
implement beautiful slide transitions so

00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:28,160
yes we had to implement some elementary

00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:31,790
OpenGL support as well oh yes and then

00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:33,140
after all this was done came like 1000

00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:37,400
different paper cuts

00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:39,800
lots of rendering glitches to fix lots

00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:45,700
of things that have to be made behave

00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:48,620
but well some users use some external

00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:51,440
input methods if they write in Chinese

00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,980
Japanese Korean languages so we need to

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,200
add support for for that as well and

00:23:53,980 --> 00:24:00,110
also as I mentioned like we use the cue

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,810
accessibility interface to implement

00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:05,990
some elementary accessibility so every

00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:08,330
single LibreOffice window and with with

00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:11,000
cute front-end is exposed to the screen

00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:15,880
radius correctly and of course remove

00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,880
many crashes and polish many rough edges

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:23,120
so you may think okay this is this is

00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:26,980
great are you scary I want to try this

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:29,929
out where can i where can I get the coat

00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:33,169
well the code is in labor of his master

00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:37,730
if you build liver office yourself you

00:24:33,169 --> 00:24:40,130
need to switch on q25 and kf5 every

00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:42,860
single every single daily build that

00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:45,530
document foundation ships that you can

00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:49,880
install has this on so you can download

00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:52,789
the daily build it's already shipped

00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:57,710
with LibreOffice six - that came out in

00:24:52,789 --> 00:25:03,169
February this year so it means every

00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:05,780
major Linux distribution has it yes so

00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:08,870
but like this this version it's it's

00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:10,190
okay but some of the nice things are not

00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:13,250
there yet

00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:16,190
labor office six three that came out in

00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:22,549
August this year is much better off and

00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:25,669
is by now relatively back three so yes

00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:27,980
like we we received one back last week

00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:30,260
but it was like officer I don't know one

00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:38,350
month one month break when nobody was

00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:43,809
reporting anything so any questions or

00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:43,809
comments or constructive criticism

00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:54,119
[Applause]

00:25:56,050 --> 00:26:02,000
timo yeah I had the demo on my I don't

00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:04,520
know if it was this is your laptop

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,370
I had a demo on violet but like it

00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:10,390
wouldn't work with this project

00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:10,390
unfortunately it's a hardware problem

00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:27,720
what

00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,360
mm-hmm

00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:41,730
so there's some automated desktop

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,320
detection if you have KDE desktop so

00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:46,380
this is this is what you get by default

00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,390
if you have if you have known the stop

00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:50,900
you have to set some environment

00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,900
variable

00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:17,529
Thank You Katrina there's the good

00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:17,529
