[Music]

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:23,570
okay see this works so I'm here to talk

00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,279
about curb cuts accessibility features

00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,740
you're just features my name is Cassidy

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,289
James I'm Cassidy James blady I'm

00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:33,140
involved as co-founder in CX o at

00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:34,760
elementary Inc and in case you don't

00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,190
know what we make we make elementary OS

00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,480
it's a Linux based OS I think you all

00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:42,260
probably know about it so I'm gonna skip

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:46,070
it for time but yeah it's a platform and

00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:48,010
that's some of our stack it's a lot of

00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:51,020
overlap with gnome technologies

00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:54,320
I'm from gnome and collaborate upstream

00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:56,690
with them quite a bit I want to preface

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,059
this by saying I'm not an expert in

00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,260
accessibility by any means I've been

00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:03,140
working with elementary for about a

00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,670
decade now but not I'm not formally

00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,430
trained in accessibility

00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,600
if a accessibility researcher or

00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,619
somebody who's been in the industry for

00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,880
a long time tells you something

00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:14,210
different than me probably listen to

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,220
them instead of me but I do want to talk

00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,990
about how we can change our mindset a

00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,210
little bit in software and especially at

00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:22,040
free and open source software when it

00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,750
comes to accessibility and how we

00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,979
implement these features in our in our

00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:29,479
products so who knows what a curb cut is

00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:31,070
and I think if you read the abstract of

00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:33,320
the talk I may be spoiled it there but

00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,909
raise of hands anybody know what a curb

00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,540
cut is or is familiar with that term oh

00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:40,670
cool so I could explain something it's

00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,290
where a sidewalk meets the road it's

00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,240
simple you've seen it probably in every

00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:46,130
major city pretty much around the world

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,799
at this point for the last 60 years or

00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:51,619
so it was originally designed for

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,810
wheelchairs so curb cuts were an

00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:55,880
accessibility feature that you know

00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,290
before 60 years ago these weren't a

00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,579
thing you had a sidewalk it met a road

00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,049
there was a curb and you just jumped off

00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:02,750
the curb or jumped up the curb or

00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:04,759
whatever and it was fine except for when

00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,290
there were wheelchairs involved and

00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:08,060
you'd have to have somebody literally

00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,989
lift you up and put you down on the

00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,010
sidewalk and that's not a good

00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:15,170
experience that's kind of crappy so

00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:16,670
there's a good background of curb cuts

00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,020
and kind of their origin and when they

00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,490
started become popular

00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:23,780
if you're into podcasts and there's an

00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:25,790
article there at 99p org but they're

00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:28,670
also really useful for people who might

00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:30,680
not have mobility issues somebody like

00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,930
pushing a two-wheel cart with packages

00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,940
on it or somebody pulling a wagon behind

00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:38,660
them or like a skateboard or scooter or

00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:41,750
something so they're really useful and I

00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,890
can zoom in here it's that thing they're

00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,480
really useful for a wide variety of

00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,100
people but they're also critical for

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,180
accessibility and they're kind of

00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:51,950
they're everywhere so these what I

00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,630
consider curb cuts in you I would say

00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:56,150
you know meet these three criteria it's

00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:58,190
ubiquitous ubiquitous default it's

00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:02,080
everywhere handy for a wide variety

00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,080
people but critical for accessibility so

00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,010
before I get into free software

00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:08,600
specifically or elementary OS

00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,830
specifically I want to look at some

00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,950
examples that you're probably familiar

00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:17,390
with across other platforms such as like

00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:21,020
mobile on-screen keyboards are curb cut

00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:22,910
these started as a desktop accessibility

00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,770
feature for people who might not have

00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:27,380
the motor control or strength to use a

00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:29,210
standard keyboard and they but they

00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,910
might have had motor control to control

00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:33,380
a cursor on a screen but now they're

00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:35,480
ubiquitous and touch screens because of

00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:38,420
the form factor mostly but they're

00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,550
actually it's really useful now in like

00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,450
platforms like Mac OS or not Mac OS

00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:45,620
because they don't have touchscreens but

00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:47,690
Windows the iPad chrome OS Android these

00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,890
platforms have on-screen keyboards which

00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,570
are really really nice for their touch

00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:56,480
screen form factors but they're also

00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:57,980
really nice for accessibility reasons so

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,080
they're it's the ubiquitous default most

00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,310
platforms support it by default it's

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,110
just a feature of the OS you don't have

00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:06,350
to go install an on-screen keyboard on

00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:07,550
Windows it's just part of the OS it's

00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,290
handy for a variety of people whether

00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:12,680
that's motor impairments or whether

00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,850
that's touchscreens and it's critical

00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,630
for people who couldn't otherwise use

00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:20,660
the device speech input is another one

00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:23,120
this is a big one we've seen with like

00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,400
smart phones and smart home devices and

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,560
you know hey Siri hey Google Alexa

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,700
what's the weather I promised myself I

00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,800
wouldn't do that but if your device goes

00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:34,910
awesome I'm sorry I guess Mycroft this

00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,770
is an accessibility feature on the

00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,530
desktop for dictation and controlling

00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:43,310
your software but it's become ubiquitous

00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:44,690
we have voice input everywhere and we

00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,310
control random light bulbs and things

00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:50,450
with it and we you know ask the weather

00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:52,250
and and my mother-in-law who has a smart

00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:54,169
phone like when she texts a long text

00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,760
she will start typing it and she'll just

00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,350
be like I'm just gonna hit the button

00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,479
and talk to it because that's easier and

00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:03,229
simpler for me to understand so it's

00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:06,290
again it's uh-oh and it's here I don't

00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:08,090
know if you can see it's just a default

00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,650
feature on keyboards on this on iOS and

00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,600
on Android it's just there's just a

00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:14,000
button to do speech input it's just a

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,790
feature it's not a special accessibility

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,710
feature you have to go toggle on so

00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,540
again ubiquitous default it's just there

00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,010
handy for a wide variety of people

00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,660
whether they have certain impairments or

00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,790
just prefer a certain way of using the

00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,860
device and it serves a critical need for

00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:31,540
people who might not have the fine motor

00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,540
control required for a small touchscreen

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,330
closed captions is another really

00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,000
interesting one this is less about a

00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:40,850
specific platform and more kind of

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,100
widely culturally accepted phenomenon in

00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,440
the 1970s closed captions where I guess

00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,900
invented for television broadcasts and

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,610
in the u.s. at least we mandated by law

00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:53,390
that they had to be on any broadcast

00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:56,090
material that was in the US and them

00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:59,180
very soon after closed captions came out

00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:01,340
the majority of users of closed captions

00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:04,010
were not the hearing impaired which is

00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:06,890
what the law was designed to help for

00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:09,020
accessibility there was a survey that

00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:11,570
said I think it was over 70 percent of

00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,740
people who were using closed captions on

00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,020
a regular basis we're not hearing

00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,700
impaired the largest group of that was

00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,220
people who were learning a second

00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,140
language so they might be English as a

00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,669
Second Language Learners and turn on the

00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,990
TV and they can kind of hear what's

00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:25,340
going on but when they can read it it's

00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,450
much easier to understand for them and

00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:30,229
helps them learn the language better

00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:31,850
both visually and through hearing and

00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:33,950
it's also frequently used in public

00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,210
spaces for things like reducing noise

00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,500
pollution or you should have a lot of

00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,030
TVs and want to have a lot of things

00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,469
going at once and let people choose what

00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:43,280
they're looking at we see closed

00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:44,240
captions Netflix has like closed

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,699
captions on built

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,560
it's just like a button push away and we

00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:51,319
see platforms like YouTube now even like

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,680
auto-generating captions for again it

00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:56,810
helps with accessibility but if you're

00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,669
like on a train and can't really turn up

00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,870
your volume but there you're trying to

00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,550
gather some information that's in a

00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:05,300
video format that's really useful for

00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:07,220
you and we're even seeing crazy features

00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,410
now in OSS this isn't a new feature in

00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,810
Android wear anywhere on your whole

00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,910
device it will use crazy magic machine

00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,819
learning on device ai stuff and

00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:18,470
transcribe in real time what's going on

00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:21,860
in your phone or even what's around you

00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:23,210
and it's like again accessibility is

00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,150
really cool but like there's so many

00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,460
utilities for this outside of just

00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,289
accessibility so by providing this

00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,740
really handy accessibility feature it's

00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:35,720
also useful for a wide variety of people

00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,250
so again ubiquitous default closed

00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,630
captions are a standard feature it's one

00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:42,159
click away on YouTube one click away on

00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:44,900
Netflix tanyon multitude of variety of

00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:47,690
environments and it serves a critical

00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:50,509
need for those who do have who are hard

00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:52,219
of hearing so I don't look at some

00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:53,650
examples in elementary OS specifically

00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:55,460
we started an initiative we call

00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:57,759
accessibility features or just features

00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:02,210
recently you can track it on the github

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:04,880
tracker they're one of the first major

00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:06,590
efforts was we moved a lot of our

00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:10,940
universal access settings or

00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:12,770
accessibility settings out of this kind

00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,060
of tucked away corner that was hidden in

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:17,419
the OS wasn't really hidden it's just

00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,819
nobody went there we graduated them into

00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:22,009
proper standard tested features of the

00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:23,389
desktop so we're put them where you

00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:25,330
would expect them in the software with

00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:29,479
related controls that weren't just

00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:31,969
accessibility related there's kind of

00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:35,360
ironic we called it a universal access

00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:36,950
when we heard from users that not very

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,419
many of them used it because they didn't

00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,370
think it was for that they thought well

00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:44,240
I'm not disabled I don't have a handicap

00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:47,420
and it turns out that these features are

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,459
useful for a lot of people and if we

00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,470
expect it to be usable in a non broken

00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:53,690
way we should be confident enough to

00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:57,050
expose it to all users through the

00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,010
regular settings so here's an example of

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,440
it if you can see

00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:01,970
from there but we introduced this

00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,680
appearance settings for our desktop

00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:05,960
which includes things like text scaling

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,000
this used to be just an accessibility

00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,100
feature that said well you know if

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,020
you're you have poor eyesight maybe you

00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,400
want to turn up the text size there's no

00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,160
reason that this isn't useful for a wide

00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,780
variety of users as well we hear from a

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,790
lot of users of certain hardware

00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,020
resolutions and size combinations that

00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,700
they want to bump up the text size a

00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:25,850
little bit and so we just support it as

00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:27,530
a standard feature things like reducing

00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:30,080
animations and translucency are also

00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:33,710
helpful for a wide variety of people so

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,540
they're here as well we also in our

00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,460
keyboard settings we have repeat delay

00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,900
and cursor blink speeds these are kind

00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,490
of traditional accessibility settings

00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,900
but their keyboard settings really

00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,890
they're just they're related to keyboard

00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,070
input so we put them with the keyboard

00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,070
settings

00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,580
same with Mouse and touchpad controls

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,640
there's things like double click speed

00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:54,410
long press secondary click that one's

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,090
really useful for accessibility if you

00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,800
have trouble double clicking you don't

00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:59,330
have that motor control but it's also

00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,150
really helpful on touch screens where

00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:03,410
you press and hold to get a menu and we

00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:05,120
actually had users of touchscreens

00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,880
asking if there was a way we could

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,590
implement this throughout the OS and the

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,570
it's already there it's already part of

00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:13,220
the standard stack but they were having

00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:18,470
a hard time finding it so it's it's just

00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:20,750
a standard feature and mouse pointing

00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,950
settings as well revealing the pointer

00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,540
when you hit control you know if you

00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,730
have a hard time spotting the little

00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:28,040
mouse cursor that can help you find it

00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:29,240
but it's also nice for like screencasts

00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,430
and presentations if you have a mouse

00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,430
cursor on the screen in front of an

00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:36,050
audience like this controlling the

00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:37,760
pointer at the keypad again a standard

00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,470
an accessibility feature that has been

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:44,060
turned into a standard feature here and

00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:46,130
it's well supported in sound setting

00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:50,230
this one is interesting because I've

00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:52,700
actually needed this personally we have

00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:54,710
when there's an event alert so something

00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:58,100
like your backspacing in an empty text

00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:59,810
field and goes like boom boom boom we

00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,270
there's a setting there was a setting

00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:04,160
accessibility to turn that into a screen

00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:05,840
flash and then there was a setting in

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,580
the sound settings to turn that sound on

00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,750
or off we combined these settings into

00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,779
one place because they made sense that

00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:14,540
grouped together and that way you can

00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:17,089
you know do sound or flash or neither or

00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,649
both and this addresses accessibility

00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:20,990
needs like if you can't hear then a

00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:22,430
sound is not helpful to you but it's

00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:26,269
also useful in like live audio

00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:27,829
production which I've done and you might

00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:30,259
not want your machine making any extra

00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:31,759
noises besides what you're playing

00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:35,199
through through the speakers and so you

00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,199
turn it into a screen flash instead

00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:40,339
another way we've done this in

00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,689
elementary OS is better system better

00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:44,720
contrast across the entire system

00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:47,569
through the system stylesheet so the web

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,300
content accessibility guidelines or

00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:53,300
abbreviated W CAG or however you want to

00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:55,069
pronounce that they have this rating

00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,259
system of a double-a or triple-a

00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:58,999
contrast and it deals with how how

00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:01,189
contrast II the foreground text is

00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:02,839
against the background in elementary OS

00:12:01,189 --> 00:12:06,980
we strive for double a or better

00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:08,329
contrast if we will oftentimes we meet

00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,319
the Triple A contrast guidelines and

00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:12,680
we're striving to meet it in more

00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:14,749
situations and this is according to

00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:17,569
those guidelines if you have Triple A

00:12:14,749 --> 00:12:20,449
contrast and somebody still can't read

00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:22,790
your text properly they're already

00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:24,290
almost certainly using further

00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:26,689
accessibility features like

00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:28,879
magnification or screen readers so by

00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:30,649
making the entire stylesheet Double A or

00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,149
triple a contrast compliant you're

00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:34,189
really helping a lot of users who would

00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:35,600
otherwise switch into a like a separate

00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:37,490
high contrast mode so this has reduced

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,459
the need for a completely separate

00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:41,839
experience for these users it's also

00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:44,000
just nice when you're on a projector

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,980
like this and your foreground text and

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,180
background texts you know the projector

00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,889
doesn't have the best contrast in the

00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,569
world so by having better contrast

00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:56,480
through the whole system it's easier to

00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:58,040
read for everybody another initiative

00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,569
we've done with this is introducing

00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,500
color schemes into some of our core apps

00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:05,300
like the terminal and code editor and

00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,709
they're accessible by default color

00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,050
scheme choices instead of you know

00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:10,459
saying here's a million different colors

00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,199
you choose what color works for you

00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:14,600
which you can still do under the hood if

00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:18,079
you know how it all works we offer three

00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:20,660
like bespoke pre-designed accessible by

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,240
default color schemes a dark a light and

00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:25,370
a high contrast light and these are

00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,610
great I've heard from people who use the

00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,769
high

00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:30,050
contrast light theme for things like

00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:31,190
their programming outside and the

00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,480
sunlight is hitting their screen and

00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,500
like they have the brightness all the

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,450
way up and they can't see their screen

00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,709
but with this high contrast mode they're

00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,420
getting at the maximum brightness they

00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:40,130
can and it's just a standard feature

00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:43,550
that anybody can use you know in that

00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:44,870
situation you might not think I I need

00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,010
an accessibility feature I'm gonna go

00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,360
find it in the settings turn on a

00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,769
system-wide accessibility setting you

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,510
just are trying to code or something and

00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:53,540
so it's really handy to have this quick

00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:55,459
access as a standard feature and for a

00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,690
dark and light style it says this helps

00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,890
people with you know if they have

00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:01,010
migraines or working in a dark

00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:02,899
environment this kind of echoes some of

00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:05,209
the talks we've had about a system-wide

00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:06,529
dark preference it's just more

00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:10,970
accessible and it's just a standard

00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:13,790
feature that's well supported so these

00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:16,310
are all really cool features but I think

00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:19,610
what's really important the big takeaway

00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:21,410
is they're not really features it's it's

00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:24,230
more about the mindset that you have

00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:25,430
when designing your software I hope that

00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,079
as designers and developers of

00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:29,240
especially open source software we can

00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:31,579
adopt this mindset of curb cuts in

00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,430
making our software accessible to people

00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:39,019
by default and more useful to more

00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:41,510
people and again better design oh yeah

00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:42,410
if you if you implement curb cuts

00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,930
throughout your software I believe

00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:46,730
you'll have better design it'll be more

00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:48,320
useful to more people and it'll be

00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,510
better tested for those accessibility

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,640
features since they're not just a

00:14:50,510 --> 00:15:00,680
separate feature thank you

00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:02,760
[Applause]

00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:06,710
and do we have time for questions

00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,710
cool that was pretty short

00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:24,310
I appreciate what you did because in my

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,370
experience the accessibility features

00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:29,800
are the first one to fall victim to

00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:33,850
other cuts in particular the budget cuts

00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:37,149
and my actual question then is those

00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:40,750
those color schemes any consideration

00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:43,690
towards the color blind users like any

00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:46,480
color scheme specific like so that they

00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:49,209
can distinguish like the I don't know

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,760
the the contrast like contrast of colors

00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:54,459
with focus on those who can't

00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,779
distinguish the colors yeah so this is

00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:57,790
another kind of accessible by default

00:15:55,779 --> 00:16:00,940
thing we're doing throughout the design

00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:03,490
of elementary OS we try not to ever rely

00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:07,720
only on color for meaning so we always

00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:12,070
try to have a symbol or shades not just

00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:13,450
a strict colors there's I don't I guess

00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,820
there's not a separate separate

00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:19,240
colorblind accessibility mode than I'm

00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:22,360
aware of but again by using symbols and

00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,100
and common metaphors I'm not relying on

00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,480
color so and this also helps for like

00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,640
we've seen on other platforms they have

00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,089
like grayscale modes for like reducing

00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:32,589
the amount of distraction that you get

00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:34,480
and I found like on my phone that that's

00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:35,980
really important to be if it's only

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,290
using color to distinguish things then

00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,459
even for me who's not combined when I'm

00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,779
using certain modes or in certain

00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:43,390
environments with dim lighting or

00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:48,120
whatever it's more accessible to me as

00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:48,120
well thank you good question

00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:57,790
so I really like the idea of

00:16:52,680 --> 00:17:00,279
accessibility by default and um how

00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:04,510
could we make that as an experience just

00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:06,250
like a cross app ecosystem as I mean do

00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:09,429
you have it do you have you thought

00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:12,010
about that ideas across you know just

00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:15,569
all of our desktop projects it seems

00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:18,880
like a great distinguishing feature

00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:20,919
especially in this small segment that

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,339
sometimes often forgotten when we write

00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:25,900
build and write apps right so I think a

00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:28,360
big part of that is it's up to the

00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,429
platforms platforms should have

00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,970
accessible style sheets by default so

00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:33,280
I'd wait

00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:36,330
and the elementary stylesheet and what

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:39,580
Katie use it by default should be

00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:41,770
accessible in high contrast but also

00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:43,780
human interface human interface

00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,400
guidelines for those platforms have a

00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,990
role to play there as well if saying hey

00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,640
accessibility is important here's how

00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,110
you can make sure you have high contrast

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,980
make sure you use symbols in these

00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:55,600
contexts not just color and establishing

00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,820
those conventions in first party apps as

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,110
well so I think all know maps and all

00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,750
elementary apps should strive to have

00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:05,020
very very good accessibility by default

00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:06,970
without resorting to separate modes and

00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,620
that's not to say separate modes are

00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:10,240
unimportant and you should also test

00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,150
everything in separate modes as well but

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,830
I think when that happens those are the

00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,390
most likely instances where you have

00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:18,130
broken apps is when you're using it in a

00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:21,490
theme you've never tested against for

00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:23,590
example so yeah I think setting setting

00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:25,270
the standards by the platform's

00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:29,820
themselves is probably the most

00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:29,820
effective way sorry

00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:41,770
so I'm just night mode really interfere

00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:46,210
with since it changes the temperature of

00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:47,530
the screen does decide yes so that so

00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,030
you're saying like a night shift night

00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,929
mode where it's or night light I guess

00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:53,980
where it's shifting red over the day I

00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:56,830
don't think it really interferes I think

00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,450
that's yet another example of it could

00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:01,390
be considered accessibility it's trying

00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:03,040
to make your device easier for you to

00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,120
use or your the device easier for

00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,210
certain people to use in certain

00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:09,400
circumstances I think again that goes

00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:11,980
back to color and color blind testing

00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,970
and using symbols if if you assume your

00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:15,490
screen is gonna look a certain way and

00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:17,860
it's actually way more red certain

00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:20,230
colors can get lost but that's also true

00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,910
of just hardware in general like certain

00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:24,370
displays are a lot lower quality again

00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:26,710
like projectors or just older desktop

00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:28,360
displays or whatever so I think these

00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:30,780
are pretty universal principles for

00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,780
design

00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:38,980
yeah I oughta like the idea to have

00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:40,840
access accessibility by default I'm a

00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:45,510
journalist and I'm actually writing

00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:49,870
about nautical ah dexterity on Linux and

00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:52,660
I gathered some feedback and what we

00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:55,080
should keep in mind is said that

00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:58,060
accessibility is not accessibility so

00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:02,560
different people have different needs

00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:04,710
for example I asked a guy who had

00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:08,020
problems with seeing and he said

00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:10,450
high-contrast is from him a problem the

00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:13,690
windows are jumping for him and so he

00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:15,700
put it to make it a total different and

00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:19,420
make it low contrast which is more

00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,980
acceptable to him so but of course to

00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,830
have it by default and for the most

00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:25,870
people and then to have it to set up the

00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:29,820
possibility to set it up for special

00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:36,460
needs this good thing and I also make

00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:38,500
some people from I showed them just to

00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:42,750
Boone too and they didn't know Linode

00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:44,800
before and they tested Alexis okay some

00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,420
accessibility features I need to set up

00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,020
in the accessibility settings some

00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,240
others

00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,800
I'm aspects jump back to the mouse

00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:55,240
settings and so on

00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:57,660
this was also confusing so and when we

00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,420
think about for example on-screen

00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:03,220
keyboard

00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:04,810
maybe I'm not correct but I thought it'd

00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:08,320
come more from not from accessibility

00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:12,550
more from yeah like have touchscreen

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:14,740
devices and we want to have so it's a on

00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:16,360
screen keyboard in chrome is isn't it

00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,140
what it is from this approach to have a

00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:22,540
chrome tablet or something or I'm wrong

00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:24,760
yes so in I guess I'll go in order there

00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:27,130
there was talking about low contrast and

00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,200
differing needs for different people for

00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:31,300
that we've talked about by having a high

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,770
contrast style by default it's actually

00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,890
a lot easier to do things like a low

00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:37,120
contrast shader in the window manager

00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:38,980
it's a lot harder to get good quality

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,230
results in like increasing the contrast

00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:43,450
in a shader without really blowing stuff

00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:45,490
out but it's a lot easier to reduce the

00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:48,040
contrast for certain users so I think by

00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:48,400
having a more accessible default for a

00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,900
lot of

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,280
people you can also do more interesting

00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,710
things in software that makes it more

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,210
useful for other people as well and I

00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:58,650
know we talked a little bit about that

00:21:55,210 --> 00:22:01,780
at kwatak last year or earlier this year

00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:03,040
as far as the separation of settings you

00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,540
know having separate accessibility

00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,890
settings versus integrated into the

00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:08,830
settings that's a conversation we had a

00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:10,360
lot I haven't heard I guess any like

00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:14,650
expert opinions on it I'd be curious to

00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:16,420
hear that I think the goal unless I hear

00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:19,150
a strong a compelling case otherwise the

00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:20,590
goal would be to have all of these

00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:22,930
settings in there more natural places

00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:25,360
throughout the system so they're more

00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:26,590
more widely used and just easier to find

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,270
when you're looking for them I think

00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:31,690
having a separate accessibility section

00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:32,830
may be a relic of a time when we just

00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:36,190
kind of shoved everything in the corner

00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,630
and didn't ever test it but I'm not sure

00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,400
if I hear otherwise I think there's

00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,720
interesting things we can do something

00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,460
we do in elementary OS is we actually

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,780
have system-wide search so if you're

00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,190
searching for certain types of settings

00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:48,100
it's really easy to expose where they

00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:49,330
are in the in the settings app itself so

00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,910
I think there's probably more

00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:55,660
interesting things we can do around that

00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:57,880
and the third thing was keyboard yeah so

00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:59,830
I'm not I am fairly certain in gnome

00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,840
shell it was designed for touch but I

00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:03,340
think the feature as far as desktop goes

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,960
like it predates touchscreens on

00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,750
computers like having an onscreen

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,550
keyboard that feature because there's

00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,230
certain users who maybe can't use their

00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,640
hands but are using the the pointer

00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:16,090
stick on their head and motion tracking

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:21,220
and that's a way they can type without

00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:23,170
using using their hands or fingers so

00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:24,970
that that sort of a feature originally

00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:27,100
was an accessibility feature and then

00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:29,200
now has become a widespread like

00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,270
hardware compatibility feature or form

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,320
factor feature but it also still is

00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:34,320
really useful for accessibility

00:23:38,029 --> 00:23:45,329
for example the on-screen keyboard on

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:48,599
genome it don't has tap or some keys you

00:23:45,329 --> 00:23:53,429
you need for example if you so and the

00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:55,409
problem of the the problem of thinking

00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:57,089
like accessibility features are features

00:23:55,409 --> 00:23:58,289
for everybody I like the idea but what

00:23:57,089 --> 00:24:00,329
we keep in mind of

00:23:58,289 --> 00:24:02,729
we shouldn't then forget accessibility

00:24:00,329 --> 00:24:04,879
needs yeah so right if I say okay so I

00:24:02,729 --> 00:24:08,789
just want a fancy on-screen keyboard

00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:10,559
first nice yeah so and if I want to I

00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:12,299
never use a terminal with the on-screen

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:15,899
keyboard but some people need it too

00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:19,019
so we shouldn't forget the testing on

00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:20,159
accessibility yeah yeah I think Karen

00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:24,089
goes back to there's varying needs for

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,559
varying people yeah yeah I'm not super

00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:28,109
familiar with the gnome shell keyboard

00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:29,369
specifically and what features it has we

00:24:28,109 --> 00:24:32,489
don't we don't use no Michelle in

00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:36,059
elementary OS so yeah I think it is

00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:38,569
important to remember that any more

00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:38,569
questions

00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:48,740
thank you

00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:48,740
