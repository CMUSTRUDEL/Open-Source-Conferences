00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,259
hey thanks so much thanks for making out

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,750
this morning as well it's it's quite a

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:14,639
keen start so I I gave a presentation at

00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:17,330
Braddock about the idea of using the

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,650
free desktop using genome as a way for

00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,960
teaching programming the idea that we

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,680
could finds a particular target markets

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,330
that we feel is not well served by

00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,980
software and the tech industry at

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,390
present and then deliver something

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,830
better than what they could get in other

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,320
places so kind of find people find

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,850
contributors find people who build

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,160
technology and we want to give them

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,850
control of technology and then bring

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,290
them in to free software and two people

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,719
came to me actually after my talk and

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,520
and raised the same concern she one of

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,260
them work was nobec and he was saying

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,579
well you know you have these things in

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,860
endless this is great you're teaching

00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,960
people how to code but are you teaching

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,129
them how to code free software are you

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,620
teaching them these tools and these

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:00,180
languages and there's like well actually

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,920
first we have some things which are

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,530
teaching Java scripts ok maybe you could

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,670
do some web development in these things

00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,490
we have some things which are teaching

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,020
unity right you can go to games

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,360
developments and these are skills which

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,130
if you learn them you can then go to

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,630
have a career and you can you can earn

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,439
money and you know make your millions

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,210
and with these technologies what about

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,500
us what about the free desktop what

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:27,270
about free software we the other people

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,490
who came to me actually was stellar and

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,520
and sagu who work on on advocating you

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,799
know in Kenya and they saw the same

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,740
problem why they have interns and they

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,990
run code camps they have google Summer

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,540
of Code projects where people are

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,799
learning how to hack on open source

00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,909
software they're learning alright good

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,790
stuff all of our tools things like

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,070
Nissan and then ok great what do I do

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,149
now how do I get a job well you learn

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,350
something else and you go and work for

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,799
someone else who's not using these

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:59,219
things so we have a problem of capturing

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,380
value within our ecosystem so you know

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,659
free software is a great training camp

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,920
for all of these amazing skills which

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,899
once you've shown them there on your

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,610
github profile and then Google hires you

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,520
and you disappear or Facebook hires you

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,959
and you disappear so how do we close

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,110
that loop right what do we actually need

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,569
to build to improve that

00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,519
and the gold of endless is actually to

00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:23,069
give people that to give people control

00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:25,140
of their technology to give people the

00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:27,030
opportunity to actually participate in

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,310
you know what I would call this digital

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:32,640
economy we talk about this concept of

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:35,069
digital agency and I think building an

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,530
app store and actually having a kind of

00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:40,799
a closed system a kind of an ecosystem

00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,660
and an economy around free and open

00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:44,579
source software is absolutely essential

00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,200
for us to succeed at this goal right we

00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:47,730
want everyone to be sitting at a free

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,590
software system that they can get the

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,030
source code and they can control we care

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,470
about that because that means they have

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,019
control of their computer they have

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,430
control of their information but that

00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:59,160
has to work for them why that has to

00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,540
make make economic sense for them that

00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:06,660
has to pay their bills and put a roof

00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:07,769
over their heads so app stores why do we

00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,780
need an app store why do we care about

00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:11,459
this might we have distros there are you

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,690
know 20,000 packages in fedora

00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,090
whatever you know all of them are fonts

00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,829
but no and there there are great things

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,239
that are already existed in the world

00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,769
why do we need to go and build something

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,870
different and change it and introduce

00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:23,220
this you know this evil money right no

00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,630
big struck through profit on his

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:30,299
presentation so we you won't need to

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:33,060
change that and this is markets law

00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:35,519
right the idea here is curve appeal so

00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:38,099
we the free desktop community are trying

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,419
to welcome people in to free software

00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:41,340
we're trying to put something in front

00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,630
of them that is appealing we want them

00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,209
to put their phone down to put their

00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:47,250
iPad down and to sit down at their Linux

00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:50,700
desktop and spend their time and energy

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:52,139
within our system so it has to work for

00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,209
them it has to be appealing has to look

00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:55,380
nice it has to have the tools that they

00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:57,870
need to get their job done

00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,819
so they need to come in and do something

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,169
that's they wanted to get them right

00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:02,970
they need to have an app that meets

00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:04,859
their specific use case they might be a

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,629
carpet fitter right the carpet fitting

00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:08,220
applications that that measure the

00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:10,709
carpet unit I had a friend who works on

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,410
this no free-software carpet fitting

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,669
application right but then if that guy

00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,049
doesn't have a carpet fitting

00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:18,030
application he can't do his job so he's

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:19,949
not going to use our system so there are

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,239
a million applications like this that

00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:23,400
you know we need someone to care about

00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,530
it it needs to exist otherwise when that

00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,419
person gets their new endless laptop out

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:29,729
of a box for maysa the first thing they

00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:31,440
do is like I can't do my stuff and then

00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:33,150
they delete endless and that's what's

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,039
happening at the moment right so we we

00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,840
are building all of these systems to get

00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:40,099
people in to get people contributing to

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,270
get people using and then we lose them

00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:45,240
the other thing that for me is

00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:48,419
incredibly important about the idea of a

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,430
kind of an economy sustaining free and

00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:53,490
open source software is this idea of

00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,960
inclusivity right there is a a certain

00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,849
selection process and there's a certain

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,610
bias and a certain prerequisite that you

00:04:56,849 --> 00:05:01,530
need to have the rights and to have the

00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,390
ability to take part in free software

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:05,159
projects you need to have electricity

00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:07,229
you need to have a computer you need to

00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:08,729
have free time know you need to have you

00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:10,289
know you your kids are in bed or someone

00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:12,990
else looks after them and then you can

00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:14,490
spend all night hacking or or doing

00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,260
whatever it is that you're doing to

00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,440
support your free software communities

00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,940
so this is a this is a diversity problem

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,030
this is a inclusivity problem that

00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,780
prevents people from getting into our

00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:28,289
development process and into our

00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:30,030
community so we need to to actually give

00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:32,280
additional motivations and additional

00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:34,530
reasons for people to to be able to take

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,180
those journeys right why is it worth me

00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,610
spending my time writing software for

00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,469
you if I actually have to go and work or

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,450
I have to feed my family and whatever so

00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:44,460
we cut a whole bunch of people out just

00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:47,250
because we have a system that you know

00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,020
relies solely on altruism but then

00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,370
there's a requirement for people to also

00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:54,840
look after themselves and their family

00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:57,360
so there's a tension here and ultimately

00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,909
it speaks to this sustainability right

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,150
so we bring people into the system we

00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:05,159
teach them how to use it and then they

00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,779
become contributors but in order to earn

00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:08,479
money then they go somewhere else right

00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:10,349
so we have this stairway to nowhere and

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,000
potentially quite obviously there are

00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:13,800
people here who are lucky myself

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,159
included to be paid to work in free

00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,440
software but that is a minority of paid

00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:21,389
software jobs in the world

00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,190
so if we want free software to be the

00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:24,360
thing that people use it has to be the

00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,250
thing that people make money with as

00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:31,709
well the system needs to be a closed

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:33,000
loop that can can can grow so I guess

00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:35,580
I'm speaking here in enormous new

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,060
capacities and this is is hoping to help

00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,630
build this and but I don't want it to be

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,190
friendless

00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,450
I want it to be for

00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:45,830
I want it to be something that's larger

00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,830
something it's for the free desktop

00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:52,170
whatever we build is out software

00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:54,030
freedom that's the first thing I said we

00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:56,550
we're not trying to make a trade of

00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,560
freedom against money you know if we

00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,670
don't build something through through

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,150
the community through the gloaming

00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:04,980
foundation then we we can't make a trade

00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,480
off of freedom for money we could okay

00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,710
sell your apps and then actually we'll

00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,240
just forget the principles that we're

00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,160
founded on and those things that we'll

00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,630
hear to actually support no we this

00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,260
needs to be additive if we can't trade

00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,260
one thing for another

00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,420
hopefully we all agree with this

00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,510
hopefully we're all here for the same

00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:25,140
reason make the app king/queen other

00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:27,180
monarchs are available and we you know

00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,920
computing on the desktop is turning into

00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,020
this kind of miserable web thing where

00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,880
you need 64 gigabytes of RAM just so

00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,770
that chromium can keep 12 slack tabs

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,020
open oh it's terrible right it's a

00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,820
terrible experience in terms of giving

00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,340
people control of their data in terms of

00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,870
giving people good power performance you

00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,400
know we have solar-powered computers

00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,720
with endless wear you know you load

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,040
slack and boom that's it you know you

00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,960
could have been using a computer for six

00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:54,360
days but now it like the source code to

00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,650
those web apps and things so the idea

00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,510
that you actually want people on a

00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,160
desktop computer to be using native apps

00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,900
which have been made with love and care

00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,669
and they have a good experience and they

00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,590
actually do better work for you and they

00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:06,030
do a better job for the user that's

00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:11,250
really important right so we want to put

00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:14,850
to promote that concept pay what you

00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:16,410
want so fix one accessibility and

00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,990
inclusivity problem by switching it for

00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,669
another we can't say oh well you know if

00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,900
you can't afford to write free software

00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:23,040
then we're going to pay you but now if

00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,640
you can't afford to buy it then you

00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:28,919
can't have it right so this idea that we

00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,960
can encourage people and try to build a

00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:33,120
kind of sharing economy where people are

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,160
actually motivated or nudged or you know

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,440
a little bit of arm-twisting but we have

00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,710
to make it possible for people to still

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,240
take part in our ecosystem as users

00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:46,080
without placing barriers in a different

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,750
place and vendor-neutral

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,880
right you know I'm for Memphis I want

00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:53,010
this to happen in you know so we can at

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,990
least say that this isn't just renders

00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,310
user ultimately if it

00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,350
has built this for everyone else and

00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,390
millions of people use it outside of

00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,920
endless then that's a success for me

00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,480
that's a success for endless because we

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,060
are trying to promote this concept of

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,520
software freedom everywhere so we don't

00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,770
want a disincentive for participation

00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,120
from particular vendors by tying it into

00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:14,180
one system into one technology or

00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,740
something that that's that's going to

00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,790
make a would-be competitor a situation

00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:22,260
or I'm not going to put that thing

00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:23,700
because it's theirs right and yeah

00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,649
platform neutral right so there are many

00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,899
different Linux systems around people

00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:30,300
acquire Linux through different vendors

00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:31,860
through different distributors their

00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,070
technology has to work in as many places

00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,000
as possible because otherwise we're not

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,339
closing this loop to bring as many

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,660
people in and and helping a system that

00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:45,300
kind of builds and propels itself and

00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,950
ultimately sustainability right so this

00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,390
has to pay for itself to what it to

00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,070
certain extent you know we can we can

00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:52,380
rely on sponsors to some extent but we

00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:58,230
have to be able to fund what we're doing

00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:59,490
and keep funding what we're doing so in

00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,130
terms of building blocks that we're

00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:05,850
looking at and what we have today I mean

00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:07,020
the the game-changer here that actually

00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:10,529
enables us to even have this

00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:12,720
presentation is it's flat back and thank

00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:13,980
you Alex and and the decades of other

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,770
people who've also put work into

00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,450
containers and d-bus and all of the

00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:22,470
magic stuff that actually means that

00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:25,980
that that can exist today and you know

00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:28,140
we some people have criticized in Linux

00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,120
desktop for fragmentation right that you

00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,950
know I've got a Debian here and a

00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,810
scissor here and an Ubuntu here in a Red

00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,579
Hat here and I can't just write a Linux

00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:38,010
app and have it work that doesn't work

00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:40,950
all right and so we've been chasing

00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:43,170
after 2% of market share and then we've

00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,640
split it into a million pieces and then

00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,800
if someone's thinking about writing an

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,480
app then like well great I can write

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,339
this and I can test it on one version of

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,230
Ubuntu and then it's not going to work

00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:53,940
on the next version doesn't work on when

00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,980
how actually nevermind screw it all

00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,660
right so we we've just built this huge

00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,480
disincentive for anyone to participate

00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:03,570
in the development cycle of joining in

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,370
to the Linux desktop and the other thing

00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:07,110
that Miguel also kind of comments about

00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,150
you know he had a big kind of blog post

00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,390
where he

00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:13,250
explains his you know his his sad feels

00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:15,650
about the nukes desktop that you know we

00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,720
are all kind of idealists tech idealists

00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:19,250
to some to some extent we want to make

00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,839
the API better will make the bill system

00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,670
better wouldn't be perfect so we break

00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:24,170
everything all the damn time even when

00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,370
we say we're not going to we still kind

00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,230
of break it a little bit but it's okay

00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:30,500
because you know as both my friends and

00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:32,540
it's fine actually flat-pack solves both

00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,550
of these things right you have flat pack

00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,740
that can run across a whole bunch of

00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:39,230
different Linux systems and you have a

00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:42,980
runtime that your app chooses you test

00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:45,170
and develop it and you run it so you

00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,270
nail down the interfaces to the desktop

00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:49,040
and you know the actual binaries you're

00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:53,029
running against and we've solved both of

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,529
these problems my flat hub right it's

00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:57,350
always before web who ever knows what it

00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:59,779
is and so we have this yeah dass water

00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:03,410
bubbling foundation and ripples and

00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:05,779
distributions exams we're about hundred

00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:08,420
fifty apps you know student growth into

00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:12,589
the fight majority free and open source

00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:14,860
and we have a tool that alex is written

00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:18,380
which I think talk about later but

00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:21,440
what's be at the repository but so

00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:23,870
manages the flat-pack repository and

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,730
it's a web service that we can use to to

00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:31,550
update the repository and understand

00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:36,290
what's in it so here's the big idea we

00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:39,920
want to do turn flat hub into a pay what

00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:41,779
you like App Store so the idea is that

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,700
we can use the gnome foundation as the

00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:45,650
kind of fiscal sponsor entity and so

00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,600
they can from the legal entity the legal

00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:49,459
responsibility for the payments and the

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,400
liability about you doing money changing

00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:54,350
happen lawyers follow we will target

00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,120
only free software application so I mean

00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:58,820
there are four fire traps a flower but

00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,730
they cannot put a price on there we can

00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:03,770
we we have been charged for and bills

00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:06,620
and distribution of open-source

00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:10,100
applications only we're going to do it

00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,420
pay what you like model so we don't want

00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,770
to create that disincentive we want to

00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,600
encourage people to pay you know I'm

00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:16,400
thinking go if anyone remembers the

00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,200
original version of wheel player where

00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,579
it would be like a page of like will pay

00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,200
a plus it's amazing like do this

00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:22,080
whatever and then it'd be a tiny link at

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,120
the bottom I could know

00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,760
we hate freedom so we really want to

00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,530
encourage people to to make

00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,270
contributions and support the ecosystem

00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:33,330
they take part in but we don't have

00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:36,840
prevent them from being able to to use

00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:38,700
it and we need to implant a payment

00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,710
system so these exist already a stripe

00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,560
for example has a marketplace system

00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:45,570
that actually connects the purchaser

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,220
directly with the vendor and you

00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,710
couldn't sort of extract a fee as the

00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,930
marketplace so you know they handle

00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,760
taking the money from the payments to

00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:55,830
the publisher and then you can take a

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,900
cut so that's the sustainability point

00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:59,880
we can take some fees towards the you

00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:03,290
know they take a cut towards the fees

00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,290
and the infrastructure to support this

00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:09,030
flat hub has established best practices

00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,620
around establishing the owner of an app

00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,940
you know we check where the apps come

00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,830
from like whether it actually comes from

00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,030
the right place who's actually behind it

00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:17,700
you know are they the upstream you

00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:19,800
should they have access to it and I've

00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,840
been working together with Neil the

00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,700
Grinnell Foundation to put some legal

00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,990
agreements together for fab we need to

00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,910
Terms of Use for the end-user

00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:29,610
and we need a kind of contribution

00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:35,790
agreements that establishes that hubs

00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:37,830
right to distribute the software to make

00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:39,360
this work we need to have a way for

00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:42,870
people who are publishing apps to

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,840
control what they're doing so suggested

00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:49,610
donation may be a minimum maybe not

00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:53,370
let's see how it goes probably not

00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:54,960
we need to give support to the runtimes

00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:58,530
in the platform's right so application

00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:00,000
developers rely on the platforms and

00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:02,280
runtimes that they're building upon so

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,300
the tools in the libraries they use so

00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:07,110
my idea there which I'm open to to

00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,750
discussion on this but this is my

00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:11,910
proposal and is that we suggest the app

00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:15,990
developers will donate a portion of what

00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:17,280
they get towards these platforms so you

00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,600
know if you're using it over one time

00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,130
then you have a little slider that says

00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,840
okay give 5% to Clem

00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,730
it doesn't need to be a lot right

00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,230
because the idea is that ultimately

00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,270
we're trying to empower and enable the

00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:29,730
app developer and if we do that then

00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:31,790
we'll get you know enough to work you

00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:34,020
know even by taking a small amount and

00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:35,790
then build that functionality over time

00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,500
well you know we want stats we were

00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,470
grass we want pie charts we want a

00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,000
spinny counter with number of dollars

00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:44,580
the ability to control where your apps

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,600
go I mean I haven't actually designed

00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:49,410
this I'm just kind of making up

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,180
requirements on the fly we've actually

00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:54,180
started some of the kind of enabling

00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:57,420
work preconditions for this so we we

00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:59,370
prototypes endless system for

00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:03,300
controlling whether you could download

00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:05,400
an app based on getting a token and the

00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,170
the the good thing about this is that we

00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,150
can can separate the the perchick

00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:10,430
process so whether it's an API whether

00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:13,020
it's a web app that gives you a token

00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:14,700
from the download process so this is

00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,130
very much how could have game systems

00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,570
like Steamworks you know you you go

00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:20,280
through the same store you get a token

00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:25,290
then download server that you can

00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:26,580
download so we invented this in flat

00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:30,540
manager where we started with Alex

00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:33,960
finished it and this we actually control

00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:36,150
access to a couple of objects in the OS

00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:38,490
tree repo so there's a committee object

00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:40,170
and a alternatively a Delta super block

00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,700
object but you essentially if you're

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:43,140
downloading an app you need to get one

00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,660
or other of these things in order to

00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:47,430
know the rest of what you're downloading

00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:49,350
this isn't like super secure mandatory

00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:52,350
access control thing because this is

00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:54,390
ultimately not a secure system right you

00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:55,740
can slide load the app and you can move

00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:57,240
it yeah oh it's tree has peer-to-peer

00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,100
supports you can put on the USB stick

00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,180
and move it somewhere else so we're not

00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,300
trying to kind of lock this down

00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,260
completely but you know we're trying to

00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,820
come up with something that at least

00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,920
requires you to go through the website

00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:10,950
to see the screen before you go and

00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:13,550
download the stuff the good thing about

00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:15,780
not sort of access controlling and

00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:19,380
influencing how the majority of the

00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:22,200
objects are accessed and it's very CDN

00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:25,350
friendly right so our s3 has a content

00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,930
addressed structure and so those objects

00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:30,000
can be cached and available for everyone

00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:32,190
and when you access a commit object or

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,590
super block objects we can direct that

00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:35,940
to a different endpoints so we can have

00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,710
an instance of flat manager that can

00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,030
verify the token and then you can carry

00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,460
on everything else can come from the

00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:43,260
cache and can come from the CDN and

00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:45,600
obviously we can scale up very easily so

00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,800
you know IDs lambdas or whatever we can

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,390
put a flat managers wherever they need

00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,260
to be in the world to verify those

00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,640
tokens

00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,960
so this is not gonna slow down the

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,549
downloads for flat hub we can have as

00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:59,429
many flat managers wherever we need them

00:17:53,549 --> 00:18:03,840
to do the verification on the client

00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:06,929
side we've adding metadata hints into

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,299
the repository so to make a suggestion

00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:11,640
or tell the clients when the purchase or

00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:13,290
donation is necessary so that the right

00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:17,309
UI can be presented the right flow could

00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:19,340
be kicked off at the API level when

00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:21,210
flat-pack determines that the particular

00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,830
transaction or particular operation

00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,590
requires a token there's a callback

00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:30,210
getting your token but in it uses that

00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:32,429
for for the rest of the flow we have a

00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,110
kind of sketch of a d-bus api with a

00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:37,470
kind of web api to go with it the idea

00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:39,690
being that flat-pack can then talk over

00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:41,160
d-bus to an Authenticator thing that

00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,140
talks over the web to actually get the

00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,299
token and that we can configure you know

00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:48,809
for this we Poe talk to this Web Store

00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:50,549
and kind of pair that up maybe we'll

00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:53,370
write one for flat hub and we'll like

00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:55,169
one generic one because the the way that

00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:57,059
you get the tokens which tokens you need

00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:58,860
and sort of what they mean to the other

00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:01,290
end is specific to your particular

00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,730
repository so I think we'll have a

00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,840
reference implantation but it needs to

00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:07,290
be pluggable so that you can our

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,179
different ones how this actually ends up

00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:11,490
looking the API depends a little bit

00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:13,350
about how the flow works how the

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,790
purchasing flow and the end to end

00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:16,260
experience for the user so there's a

00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:18,870
little bit of design work here in terms

00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:21,150
of the interaction design and then the

00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:26,669
API and kind of you know what we plug

00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:30,179
into which module follows after that so

00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:31,740
what we do next the design I'd be very

00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:35,480
happy to talk to anyone here about the

00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:38,760
design and this has one designer and

00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:41,309
twenty-something engineers so Robin is

00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,690
very very busy we would love to be able

00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:44,970
to make progress with some of the

00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:46,860
technical stuff with a good design in

00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:48,780
hand so anyone who wants to talk to me

00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,210
about a design of this I would love to

00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,440
talk to you

00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:58,049
we're hoping to actually start work on

00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:59,490
that web app and that this so we have we

00:19:58,049 --> 00:20:01,140
have time to start working on that

00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,909
purchasing side of so that we can go

00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,830
through a checkout process

00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:08,159
and to provide some basic controls for

00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:09,450
publishing apps and then once we have

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,009
that we need to integrate it into app

00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,720
centers so an endless we use Graham

00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:15,570
software so it's where we'll send our

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,090
patches first and then basically keep

00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:19,289
working with the ground foundation to

00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,599
actually put in place those can

00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:22,889
preconditions the kind of legal

00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:24,539
contracts and you know signing up the

00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:29,070
vendors for payment processing and all

00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:32,720
that good stuff so that's me thank you

00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:40,650
very much and button any questions

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:40,650
[Applause]

00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:58,830
so awesome I'm super excited

00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:00,720
I have a question one thing that we've

00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:04,020
discovered with the pay what you model

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,600
is that users often perceive it as a

00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,830
trial experience and they say okay well

00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,410
I can pay what I want so I'm gonna

00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:12,360
download for free right now and then

00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:17,340
maybe I'll come back and pay later

00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:19,560
so have you thought about any ID sure

00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:21,720
those users because that's something

00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:24,600
that we're really struggling with is how

00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,820
to get them to come back later and say

00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,550
okay I've received value from this and

00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:33,330
and now that I have another chance to to

00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:35,790
make that decision again yes so we fool

00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:39,060
the particular implementation for flat

00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:40,500
hub we're planning to use JSON web

00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:43,080
tokens so JWT

00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,810
so we actually have and can separate

00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:48,030
list of verbs and a separate list of you

00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:50,730
know so I want to install these apps or

00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:52,920
upgrade these apps so we can because the

00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:55,770
the client will always bounce through

00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:58,740
the sort of token process whatever that

00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:00,810
is so we can define the flow there to be

00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,340
whatever we want and so we could keep an

00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:03,630
accounts and we know if someone has

00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,820
downloaded the app already and if it's

00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,960
an upgrade and then we can decide to

00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,990
show them a different screen or

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,580
something at that point or you know so

00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,140
basically nag them every time or we can

00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,510
have a grace period or something so

00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,700
we've got the kind of the the

00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:19,530
implementation allows us to do that so

00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,890
it's a matter of kind of designer intent

00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:24,660
but I I think it would be that's a good

00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:27,390
lesson that we should take onboard and

00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:31,700
feel free to you know help us get that

00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:31,700
out because we can we can fill that in

00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:48,000
hi I love what you're doing with this I

00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:50,640
have a question about the pricing for

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,140
apps you mentioned that only open source

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,910
and free software apps will be allowed

00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,400
to have a price on the store and not

00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:57,870
proprietary ones and why is that and

00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,550
based upon you answer I may have a

00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:04,260
follow-up question um well I actually

00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,280
have two answers that question and one

00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,420
of them is because thicken and

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,730
foundation is not gonna make a

00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:10,500
marketplace for proprietary software I

00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:13,920
I mean I'm gonna be looking operation

00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,750
out for it against it the other one is

00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,330
we're planning to build all of this as

00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:20,100
free open-source software the idea that

00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,600
anyone could run it you know my employer

00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,130
endless may also be interested in

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,440
running our own copy of it with our own

00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:29,429
endless stuff and that may have

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,740
different sensitivities so you can you

00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:33,300
know you can run your own and hopefully

00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,860
we can come up with some kind of login

00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,990
and passport and stuff we don't both

00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:40,350
whatever it's a some some extent to

00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:42,000
solve problem but I I don't feel it's

00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,679
consistent with the globe foundation for

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,780
us to set up a place that you can buy

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,179
proprietary software that's it for me it

00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:53,100
feels like one step too far

00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:55,920
final question was I understand Isaac

00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,390
Lee and in terms of alignment of

00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:00,990
Audiology it's not a good idea to have

00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:03,800
paid uprightly apps but if they're

00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:06,720
already gonna be on people systems

00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:09,630
because services around them require

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,760
them to exist and if if there is a way

00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:14,460
for us to points to to have a different

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,770
cut for them like say fifty percent of

00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,330
that goes to open source software it

00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:20,520
seemed like a way we could leverage

00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:24,270
their existence to further our needs

00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:26,790
which is I think great I think we could

00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:29,460
if that aligns with our Yogi's we could

00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:30,870
do do you think that's something that

00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:35,370
could be done do you think it's a good

00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:36,870
idea any idea yeah potentially yes I

00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,640
mean this is this kind of slippery slope

00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:40,290
consequentialist arguments kind of thing

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,820
I mean you know some people would say

00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:43,350
what's the right amount of proprietary

00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,750
software that you can accept using it's

00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:48,030
like it's none if we use at any then we

00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,620
sacrificed the entire universe and I

00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:51,420
sort of understands the line of

00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,020
arguments I'm a little bit more of a

00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,220
pragmatist

00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:56,520
but then

00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:58,140
I'm trying to be less controversial here

00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,060
to build consensus around what we have

00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,010
you know flab was just you know we had a

00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:03,660
DK hackfest we took a day to start

00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:08,070
talking about flat packs and we just

00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:09,570
like did a web service so it's it's

00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,920
incremental it's iterative so I think

00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:13,440
it's a conversation that would be

00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:16,920
interesting to have you know maybe on

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,920
discourse and you know we can we can

00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:21,060
think about that and I personally as a

00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,620
good home director it makes me

00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:24,180
uncomfortable because I think where

00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,710
we're sort of enabling and supporting

00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:28,470
then something that that's you know

00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:30,660
specifically opposed to to what we're

00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:33,360
trying to do and but you know it is the

00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:35,220
is it is one app less important than

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,750
getting views on the desktop that's the

00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,670
question right and it's not one that I

00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,930
personally can answer sort of on on the

00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:42,000
community's behalf it's something that

00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:45,920
we need to sort of you know have an

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,920
emergent consensus thank you

00:25:52,290 --> 00:26:01,290
great talk thank you you mentioned two

00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:04,230
subjects one was making this accessible

00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:06,660
for people who are in maybe developing

00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:09,960
nations and also you talked about

00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:12,720
minimum pricing will you have localized

00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:15,690
minimum pricing so that there you know

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,740
one dollar in San Francisco is very

00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:21,390
different to one US dollar in Mumbai

00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:24,330
that's a very good question I I don't

00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:25,740
have an answer to it different apps

00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:28,500
those two different things some of them

00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:30,510
just do a kind of I'm just going to

00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:33,750
convert you're like three dollars into

00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:36,270
you know two pounds and 47 pence and

00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:38,250
some of them apply some kind of rounding

00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:40,230
and kind of you know is your pricing

00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:41,280
like small medium or large kind of thing

00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:46,140
and then that actually has different

00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:47,850
local meanings there are kind of lookup

00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,530
tables right the IMF whatever gives you

00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:51,600
a chart of you know this is how much a

00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:52,919
dollar is worth kind of a purchasing

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,020
power equivalent in different countries

00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:58,710
and so it's something that you could you

00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:59,940
know apply a computer to I'm open to

00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:02,460
suggestions I don't have an artist at

00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,990
the moment and I think actually the

00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,000
bigger problem is not pricing but it's

00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,990
actually payments and right so as you

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,830
roll out through a number of different

00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:13,500
countries and okay stripe great US you

00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:16,140
know Western Europe fine and then India

00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:18,150
oh yeah sorry or whatever right so I

00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,880
think we're going to have more struggle

00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:23,690
kind of getting an inclusive system for

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,309
actually transacting and then we are

00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:27,809
pricing so pricing will be a nice

00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:29,250
problem to have but this is probably the

00:27:27,809 --> 00:27:30,900
bigger hurdle is to actually get the

00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,240
things set up in the first place so a

00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:36,450
follow-on question from that and do you

00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:40,010
consider crypto as being an option for

00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:42,780
taking money from people rather than via

00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:46,470
personally I hate it but that's just a

00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:47,940
personal opinion and so do i but I feel

00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:50,130
like people just doing the planet and

00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:52,919
you know buy destroy who don't have vast

00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:55,130
amounts of fear but have crypto

00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:57,809
they may want to use that I don't know

00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:59,370
maybe make it easy for them to give us

00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:01,559
real money instead and if there's some

00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:02,970
kind of other service that turns it into

00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:05,580
real money and then pays I don't know

00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:06,050
it's a bet if it if it's available in a

00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:09,200
sister

00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:10,700
that that we end up using then we're not

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,350
going to turn off but I wouldn't

00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:15,200
necessarily make it a high priority to

00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:16,820
guard and implement that and yeah I mean

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,530
it wait when you buy food in the store

00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,530
they don't usually take bitcoins so

00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:31,300
great thank so much

00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:31,300
