hello everyone so this slot we're gonna

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,950
have a panel to discuss the future of

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,530
Linux applications so my name is Heather

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,859
Ellsworth I am going to moderate the

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:19,710
panel so ask a bunch of questions and

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,260
then we'll have a special portion at the

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:26,010
end for the last 10 minutes or so where

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:29,010
I can communicate your audience

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,929
questions to the panel as well so as

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,640
we're doing this you can think of any

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:34,590
questions that you have put them in the

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,600
telegram channel for the loss

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:42,000
20:19 and just to make it easier if you

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,710
tagged a question with just hashtag

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,040
question why should I get anything

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,260
really

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,329
then it'll highlight it in telegram with

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,780
different color easier for me to find so

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,760
when I'm browsing the questions yeah

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,460
make sure that it'll have a hashtag

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,859
question

00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,760
so yeah let's let's just get started we

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,289
have a bunch of different people

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,040
representing a bunch of different

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:06,840
awesome things so I would like each one

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,140
of you to kind of just go down the line

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,869
and say what your name is what's your

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,909
project or affiliation is where you're

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:19,259
based and one adjective that defines you

00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:24,659
and then we'll get going with some

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:26,939
questions so I'll leave the adjective

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,570
thing for the end because I don't really

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,079
see it

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:35,100
my name is Alice Paul I am from

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,670
Barcelona and I am the KTV president

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,549
right now

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:46,770
I'm also a software developer in KDE my

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:48,869
adjective is going to be sleepy hi my

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,490
name is Rob McQueen I'm the current

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:53,070
president of the Graham foundation

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:57,119
border crisis and also work for Anders

00:01:53,070 --> 00:02:02,640
and I live in Cambridge in English and I

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:06,000
think my attitude would be optimist so

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,280
my name is Alex I work at Red Hat but

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,959
also do chrome stuff for my spare time

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,200
and I've been for doing that for a long

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,650
time but like the last four years or so

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,390
my

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,650
work has been on flat pack and flat

00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:21,900
table and the ecosystem around that I

00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:29,250
live in Stockholm Sweden I work from

00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:33,390
home and my adjective is like old I'm

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:37,140
Alan I work for canonical on Ubuntu and

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,939
snap Kraft been a community member in

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,159
the military community for years and

00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:44,189
years it's about 2006 and then I joined

00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:47,670
the company in 2011 I live in the UK

00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:49,319
with my family and my two cats if you

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,780
follow me on twitter you'll see me posts

00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:56,549
lots of cat pictures so I guess my

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:58,439
adjective is cat lover my name is Daniel

00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:59,790
for a I'm gonna have trouble remembering

00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:04,139
what all the questions were so my

00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:06,359
adjective is forgetful I'm the founder

00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:09,540
and CEO of elementary Inc we produce

00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:11,040
elementary OS and we use a ton of open

00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,370
source software we make a ton of open

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,680
source software I am based out of

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:20,790
Sacramento California but the company is

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:23,160
distributed but were us-based what what

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:26,750
question is that I miss I get them all

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,750
yes not forgetful

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,640
[Applause]

00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,050
[Music]

00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,960
okay so that's your microphone this my

00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:40,550
mic cut

00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:44,060
alright so I think a really good

00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:49,130
question you all can hear me right yeah

00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:50,360
okay cool so this Linux app summit is

00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:53,810
the first time that it's been joint

00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:57,260
hosted with genome and KDE so targeted

00:03:53,810 --> 00:04:00,190
to genome and KDE why did you decide to

00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:03,680
come together to host loss this year and

00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:06,380
is this a partnership that we can expect

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,800
in the future and how will it affect the

00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:13,850
app ecosystem can answer any all so

00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:20,480
maybe a lush and Rob you can kind of

00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:22,880
take to answer the I think the the main

00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,230
thing is that the I think in the media

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,540
and maybe in the wider community it

00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,280
there's this portrayal that KDE and

00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,340
Gnome should always be like at each

00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,300
other's throats and like you know like

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,950
fighting against each other and things

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,750
but the reality is that actually

00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,400
everyone in KDE and Evan Engram is

00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,650
motivated by the same thing right we're

00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,480
all actually lovers of free software

00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,160
lovers of the free desktop and we want

00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,220
to go out and encourage more people to

00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,660
use free software and to make the world

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,880
new to make an impact on the world in

00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,320
that way and so looking at apps

00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,210
particularly I think both of our

00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,070
communities have identified this is this

00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,870
is a bottleneck to how we can engage

00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,910
people into the Linux desktop and how we

00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,100
can get people in and grow what it is

00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,210
that we're doing and so to me and in the

00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,070
board of command it made perfect sense

00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,780
that we would kind of look for something

00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,310
bigger than our particular desktop

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,990
platforms and things and actually pull

00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,180
together and say what can we do together

00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,770
for Linux on the desktop so me make

00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,410
great sense and I hope to continue this

00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:17,810
cooperation but the reality is there's a

00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,790
lot of it that goes on you know on very

00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:21,680
technical and design and marketing

00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:23,510
things levels where the communities work

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:29,450
together because we are working on this

00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:32,480
bigger picture together my my answer is

00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:35,060
going to be much more egoistical which

00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,560
is I have been always very frustrated

00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:40,460
about how hard it is to get my

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:43,370
applications to the Linux users and the

00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,700
most the more involved have become with

00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,670
well higher levels

00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:50,100
my organization and well more involved

00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:52,050
with other working with more people I've

00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,770
seen that they're also frustrating this

00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:58,110
way and and for me personally well I was

00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:01,380
gonna tell us that Nam was doing the lis

00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:03,540
over her well before and what I joined

00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,610
them and it looked like we we could work

00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,060
together and what I think that we were

00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,520
making

00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:11,420
overall something that is a bigger and

00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:14,880
that it could become bigger over time

00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:16,410
because what in in the end I think that

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,760
what mattered for us that when people

00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:22,350
are sitting down with Linux device they

00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,630
need to be able to do everything they

00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:26,640
want to do and the way to do that is to

00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:29,340
make sure that there's not queries and

00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:32,940
little details that will stop them

00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:35,010
technically from while reaching where

00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,500
they want to go they just can do it

00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,300
because we're doing kind of the same and

00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,400
in the spaces where we're not doing the

00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,870
same we need to just like knowledge that

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,600
is it's something different it's some

00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:48,420
kind of diversity that we have and

00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:51,060
embrace it however we can and I

00:06:48,420 --> 00:07:00,960
definitely see this going along in the

00:06:51,060 --> 00:07:03,570
future provided logistics happen yeah so

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,560
all of you have been in the communities

00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:10,020
for a long time and I'm sure you've all

00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,980
recognized that we need to improve upon

00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:17,070
divert diversity so if you could each

00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:20,460
kind of brief briefly there are infinite

00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:23,150
time right speak to how you think that

00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:26,990
we could improve diversity

00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:30,330
this is geological it's across you know

00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:33,240
genders and you know colors and

00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:37,230
everything all kinds of thirsty so if

00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:40,430
you could briefly like just what could

00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:43,230
we do as a community and the Linux app

00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:45,710
community to increase the diversity

00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,710
there

00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:56,780
so one of the there's a two-fold problem

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,000
here this one is getting more people

00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,260
from minority groups and people who are

00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,470
under representative getting those

00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:05,300
people in which i think is a is a

00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:06,860
struggle and something you know we need

00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,140
to work hard at and I'm not necessarily

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,910
qualified to be the best person to as a

00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,220
straight white male I'm not the best

00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:16,370
qualified person to do that but the

00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:20,450
thing I do notice is the flip side which

00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:23,000
is making it welcoming so that we don't

00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:25,640
turn those people away so that we have

00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,820
in place whether it's a code of conduct

00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:32,330
or policies on ways we want our

00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:35,270
communities to behave online and offline

00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:38,810
whether it's like in meetings like this

00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:41,960
or on IRC or in forums and just

00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:45,080
encouraging people not to like judge

00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:47,690
people by their gender or background or

00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,790
you know I think diversity or whatever

00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,770
it might be but making it a more

00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,510
welcoming place I think it's there's

00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:56,450
there's two parts to it and having those

00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:58,400
code of conducts in force is also an

00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,500
important thing I think one of the

00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,100
problems we've seen over the years is we

00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:06,800
don't enforce those code of conducts

00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:09,710
strongly enough and we let we let things

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,450
slide to the point where people who we

00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:15,110
really want to be in our community

00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:17,720
get frustrated get upset get offended

00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:20,540
and just walk away and we lose people

00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,450
that way so I think there's two sides to

00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:25,790
it welcoming new people and making sure

00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:28,310
that once they're in they don't get

00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:30,560
pushed back out again by other like

00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:35,660
mean-spirited or ill-behaved to people

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:37,040
in our communities so I I agree with all

00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,830
that and I think our behavior is

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,260
important but I also think another thing

00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:46,130
is important that we have not really

00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:48,740
looked very much into in that people who

00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:50,840
are not you know you repeat that have a

00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:53,240
lot of money in spare time vacations

00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,700
might not be able to work on free

00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,580
software unless there's a monetary gain

00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:01,280
from it right you have to somehow

00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:03,350
support your families or yourself so I

00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:07,220
think having a way

00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:09,620
to make money somehow your work and uh

00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,600
passwords is important and I think we

00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:14,300
kind of have ignored that even some

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,890
people think it's evil or whatever to

00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,270
make money of free software I don't

00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:19,160
think that is even at all I think it's

00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:26,480
very important for a large fraction of

00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:28,910
the world's population yeah I think one

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,280
of the problems that we face is just

00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:34,310
looking at this panel right now is that

00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:37,570
our leadership isn't very diverse and so

00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:41,510
we need to do a better job at not only

00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:43,880
trying to get more people involved and

00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:45,650
like an internship level but we really

00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,810
need to make sure that we lift people up

00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:50,600
into leadership positions because we

00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:53,510
know just in like from a product design

00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,730
perspective that if we don't have people

00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:57,830
in leadership positions that have

00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:00,110
diverse stakes that we get products that

00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:02,270
only serve a very small set of people so

00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,830
and it's kind of a feedback loop right

00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:05,420
if our products are designed in a way

00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,860
that they only serve a certain number of

00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,930
people then we don't bring those new

00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,520
people in and then if those people don't

00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,170
get pushed up into the leadership and

00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,670
the products stay the same and and it

00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:16,640
kind of stagnate so I think we really

00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:19,010
need to like hack away at our

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,440
institutions and say you know what how

00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:24,530
do we how do we change the status quo

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,880
and get people in a place of power that

00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:29,530
are gonna make things different than

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,530
they are and bring up different concerns

00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:36,830
yeah it's the the the glen board has

00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:39,230
made this diversity and inclusion a huge

00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:41,420
priority for for this reason basically

00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,160
that we we need to not only kind of

00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,840
reach outside of our kind of normal

00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,970
communities and try and bring people in

00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,470
so we're trying to move the guada

00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,760
conference around the world so that we

00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,350
actually can interact with different

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,030
communities that actually find people

00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,470
from different places and speak to them

00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:56,000
and understand their problems with

00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:58,490
computing and what do they need to

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,780
achieve but then also to Allen's point

00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,680
of like once you go through these

00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,660
different efforts you know their

00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,730
initiatives to improve diversity and to

00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,900
bring in different minorities and then

00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,430
you have this really kind of crappy

00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,960
atmosphere and people just don't like it

00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:10,580
and believe all of that effort you've

00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,200
spent has just been wasted and it could

00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,610
be you know one comment so it could be a

00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,430
story about what happens at a conference

00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:18,920
and so the code of conduct thing

00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:22,279
put this in place for events and online

00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:24,680
spaces and it's it's taken us like

00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:26,000
decades to belong but it's at incredible

00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,100
Portland piece of this puzzle that we

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,899
can actually have bringing those diverse

00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,370
voices factor them into our communities

00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:34,550
make sure that we're putting the effort

00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:36,680
into getting diverse voices in and then

00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:39,110
respecting and hearing those and not

00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,550
kind of not creating these kind of

00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:45,310
microaggressions and these things that

00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:47,510
push people out well I agree on

00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:50,510
everything that has been said I think

00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:52,910
that to sum up a bit the conversation

00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:54,050
from my perspective is that where

00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:56,690
there's lost ideas

00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:59,930
there's not really a single solution for

00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,820
the problem and well whoever has good

00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,709
solutions is very welcome to work

00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:06,760
together with any of us and I'm sure

00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:12,830
that there's ways we can improve for all

00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:15,529
yes okay thanks so Alex just mentioned

00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:18,890
Manas monetization and I know Rob

00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:20,900
mentioned it yesterday so and then I

00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:27,380
also know the Elementary is shipping a

00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:29,330
pay what you want App Store so what does

00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:33,400
the economic model look like for apps

00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:33,400
moving forward do you all think

00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:42,990
yeah I think that it's interesting

00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:44,820
because it's been pointed out that some

00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,710
people have this perspective that making

00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,380
money in this spaces is somehow

00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:51,810
unethical and so it's been kind of an

00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:55,080
uphill battle within our own community

00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:56,550
to build a consensus that like making

00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,880
money is something that we should be

00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:01,830
trying to do but I think that we're

00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,920
coming around to that point where that's

00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:07,290
no longer such an unpopular idea and now

00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:10,140
we're thinking about okay making money

00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:12,150
isn't necessarily a bad thing so how do

00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:16,350
we do it in an ethical way and I think

00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:17,910
that when we had this discussion that we

00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:20,220
came to that conclusion that pay what

00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,780
you want is a more ethical model because

00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:25,410
we don't want to lock out people who

00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:27,690
maybe can't afford to pay a certain

00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:29,430
number of US dollars and and it sounds

00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,660
like other people are agreeing that they

00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:32,550
pay what you want might be a path

00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,830
forward and I'm interested to see like

00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,720
more innovative models but that's the

00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:38,400
one that I really believe in and I feel

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,870
like has been successful for us as an

00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:45,030
organization and the one that we've

00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:48,210
helped prop up our developers with so

00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:52,320
we've at canonical we've created app

00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:54,630
stores multiple times we had a venturi

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,200
Software Center which around the era of

00:14:54,630 --> 00:15:00,540
urban to 12 or for or thereabouts and

00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:03,390
users could so developers could publish

00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,800
applications in that store and charge

00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:07,890
for it but there were a number of

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,780
problems with that the minimum cost you

00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:12,330
to our payment provider was far too high

00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:14,970
it was like $4 50 or something was a

00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:16,680
minimum price and you had to package

00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,610
everything as a dead so you had to

00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:22,380
become a Debian package even as a

00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:24,870
developer of a game or something or a

00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,850
developer of a simple that utility you

00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:32,190
had to get over that hurdle of becoming

00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:37,290
a a Debian developer so then future we

00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:40,320
had a bunch of phone our IP which also

00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:42,480
had a pay model store so you could

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,760
publish click packages in the store and

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,920
we learnt a lot from both of those

00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,110
experiences of having paid app stores

00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,570
which meant that right now

00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:55,650
in the snap store we haven't yet

00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:58,440
implemented payments partly because of

00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:02,880
the lessons we've learned so far because

00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:05,180
we want to do it right and partly it's

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,410
it's there's a different model now

00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:10,200
whereas in the past you used to go into

00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:12,750
a store and buy a box that had disks in

00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,190
it and you know you go to a person and

00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:17,520
you pay for it and you walk out with the

00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:19,080
Box nowadays people don't so much pay

00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,870
for software as they pay for services

00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,580
right people don't pay for Spotify the

00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:25,590
app they pay for the subscription

00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:28,520
service to listen to the music you don't

00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:31,740
pay for slack the app you pay for

00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:36,270
history in your your slack channels and

00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:38,130
so it I think it's something interesting

00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:40,890
and something we certainly need to

00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:42,570
support but we need to look at how

00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:45,630
people are actually paying for software

00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:47,790
and at the moment it people aren't

00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:50,400
there's a big exception to this which is

00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:53,550
games people pay for games you buy a

00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:57,000
game for a fixed price they may be DLC

00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:58,470
but I think because of all of this we've

00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,240
been quite hesitant to implement

00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:02,640
payments in the snap store but having

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,250
conversations here this week last night

00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,770
and today we're certainly going to look

00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:11,310
again at it over the coming year but

00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:12,540
it's it's a tricky tricky thing to

00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:17,570
implement given we've tried twice

00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:17,570
already so we have some experience there

00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,240
that there's a reason that we've been

00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:24,330
kind of treading with some hesitation

00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,800
here because they as Alex said before

00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:27,150
they're just removing that kind of

00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,830
assumption of privilege that you have

00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,180
your spare time and you can write free

00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:32,340
software and just give it away and

00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,450
that's fine and that cuts the number of

00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,730
people in the world who can actually do

00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,840
this down to a tiny fraction so there

00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,640
needs to be an economy that supports

00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,490
this you know everyone needs somewhere

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,850
to live and food for their families so

00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:46,470
we it's important to me to see that that

00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:47,670
genome is as part of you know this wider

00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:50,610
movement to actually put together

00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:52,290
solutions to this and it's not

00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:54,300
antagonistic to software freedom you

00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:55,530
know every free software license you can

00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,880
take the binary and you can set it or

00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,500
charge of distribution or whatever and

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,480
then the source code that's not a

00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,980
problem for us and so just kind of

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,890
separating those ideas in people's heads

00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,110
that we can be with

00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:07,570
full unethical with freedoms and access

00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:09,670
to computing and also have an economic

00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:11,260
model I mean there are so many different

00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:13,210
models around you know free and open

00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,770
source software that make money we

00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:16,870
shouldn't just cut out developers out

00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:18,490
from that so just making sure that we

00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,809
build a system that works and doesn't

00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:25,330
kind of cross any of those red lines is

00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:30,490
very important yeah okay that sounds

00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:33,370
great all make sense so switching to

00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:36,880
kind of packaging you know in the last

00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:40,240
hmm not too long right relative to Linux

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:44,940
we've seen the creation of snap and flat

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:48,490
pack and app image can you talk about

00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:54,850
what prompted the creation of that and

00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:56,799
then what the impact has been so I've

00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:59,350
long had it interested in the technical

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:03,760
side of containerization or like app

00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:06,340
stuff but I also have III think the core

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,799
is driven from this disconnect I see

00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:11,470
between developers of application and

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:16,570
users where the distro gets in the

00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:20,710
middle and basically prolongs the cycle

00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:22,929
of releases and increases the distance

00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:29,049
between app developer and their users

00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:32,140
and my work is mostly really targeted

00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:34,960
against app developers or obviously

00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:38,950
users gets to take advantage of it but

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,929
like the point is if app developers can

00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:44,559
easily produce their apps and ship them

00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:48,000
to their customers or users and get

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:50,890
feedback and we can like improve this

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,350
iterative loop where feedback from users

00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:54,640
get into the developers hands and then

00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,350
they can fix stuff and they immediately

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,000
gets into the hands of the users and we

00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:00,910
can like we can just improve the

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,510
development model a lot and you know

00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:06,130
make more a better software I think

00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:09,640
that's the basic for all my work of that

00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:12,000
back o plus I like the technical aspects

00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,000
of a tube

00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:18,019
so snaps were an evolution of the click

00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:20,750
packages we made on the phone and they

00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:23,299
were originally not designed for the

00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:25,070
desktop use case snaps were originally

00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:27,529
designed to solve a specific problem

00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:31,460
where you may have seen news articles

00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:34,909
where a baby monitor or a Rooter or

00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:37,909
router is not getting software updates

00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:40,549
and someone finds a backdoor and is able

00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:43,580
to access millions of moochers across

00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:45,799
the world and compromises systems and so

00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:49,370
snaps and double-entry core were

00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:51,380
designed for devices generally like

00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:54,110
Raspberry Pi small board computer edge

00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,789
computing devices in order to deliver

00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:58,309
over-the-air updates to those machines

00:20:55,789 --> 00:21:02,090
in a timely fashion so they wouldn't be

00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:04,070
left out of date and you know a machine

00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:05,899
that's in the field that needs updating

00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,970
you could do over-the-air nice and

00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:09,500
easily in an atomic fashion and with

00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:11,450
roll backs and all that kind of good

00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:16,669
stuff so it was really designed for that

00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:18,380
originally and so we realized that that

00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:20,210
technology would be useful for us to be

00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:24,500
able to deliver desktop applications as

00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:26,630
well as well as server packages so for

00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,659
example if you snap install next cloud

00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:32,840
you get a next cloud server but equally

00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:35,360
you can snap install node and get the

00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:37,279
node.js environment set up to be able to

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,000
create you know JavaScript based

00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:44,570
applications so snaps origins start from

00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,059
like the tiny little non-graphical non

00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:51,070
user interactive devices out in the

00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:54,019
field and spread to servers and desktops

00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:56,179
but that I think I agree with Alex on

00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:57,830
desktop it's more about empowering

00:21:56,179 --> 00:22:01,480
developers to get their software in the

00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:04,190
hands of users superfast so a user can

00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:07,340
report an issue and the developer can

00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:09,649
fix that and not be constrained by the

00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:11,539
release process of all the distributions

00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:13,159
that the users may be using the

00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:15,549
developer can push an update and the

00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:18,529
user gets it potentially within minutes

00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:21,559
which is a very compelling argument for

00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:23,510
software delivery like I have no idea

00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:25,880
what version of Spotify I have on my

00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:27,679
Android phone and I don't care

00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,049
I just want the latest version of

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,330
Spotify and the same goes for my desktop

00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:34,760
I don't care what I just want the latest

00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:36,620
one and a significant number of users

00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,289
out there one the same thing they just

00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:41,179
want the latest shiny that has all the

00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:42,770
latest bug fixes all the latest security

00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:45,350
updates and they don't want that

00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:51,650
gatekeeper Linux distro holding back

00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:54,049
those updates along the way so we

00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:57,350
haven't been involved in the creation of

00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:59,960
either of these formats but we've been

00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:04,190
like really heavily researching the last

00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:06,590
couple years where we want to go as an

00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:09,740
organization with regards to packaging

00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:12,320
and for us the absolute most important

00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:14,750
aspect of these these new formats that

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:18,650
are emerging is kind of this trust issue

00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:20,840
and and we had this model before where

00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:23,270
we implicitly trust every package that

00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:26,510
we install on our system and we trust

00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:28,190
that someone has maintained this in a

00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,720
way that makes it safe that makes it

00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:34,130
stable that makes it respect your

00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:37,520
privacy and it turns out that we have a

00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:40,159
really big wide world now with lots of

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,470
developers all over the place and some

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:45,289
of them are malicious and some of them

00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:48,200
aren't necessarily malicious but the

00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:50,330
kind of scope of permission that we

00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,880
allow to the packaging is kind of

00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:56,929
dangerous to our users and they've

00:23:52,880 --> 00:24:00,740
encountered issues with how these

00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:04,190
packages function technically so these

00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:05,870
new formats kind of restrict things a

00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:07,820
little bit and they're built more for a

00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:11,120
modern world of applications and they're

00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:13,549
built to kind of enforce that trust

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,010
layer a little better so that when a

00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:18,350
user installs an application they have

00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:20,270
to worry a little bit less it's maybe

00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:22,820
not perfectly secure or purposely

00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:25,460
perfectly privacy respecting but it's a

00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:27,320
little bit more technically enforced

00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:30,220
than the old way and I think that's what

00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,220
makes it compelling for us

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:44,210
all right thanks so kind of going back

00:24:40,639 --> 00:24:46,820
to the whole genome kbe thing I think

00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:49,340
it's it's great again that we have lost

00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:53,059
together but are there other ways that

00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:54,889
we can pool our resources maybe this is

00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:58,129
marketing wise to improve the marketing

00:24:54,889 --> 00:25:00,799
story of Linux like overall but pull our

00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:06,789
resources to mitigate fractionalization

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:14,360
and I guess get more exposure to Linux

00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:16,129
to garner more users as I see it I mean

00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,409
there's definitely always more things we

00:25:16,129 --> 00:25:19,850
can do and there's a lot of problems

00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:22,009
that we can turn into a social problem

00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:23,659
and all of these it's a matter of all

00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:26,210
sitting together and doing things and

00:25:23,659 --> 00:25:28,369
but we've done that several times less

00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:30,799
an example and we will probably continue

00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:34,639
doing it over the years but I think that

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:37,070
here what what matters is that is this

00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:38,990
this this conversation where we're

00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:42,259
actually allowing the developers of

00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:43,999
applications and users have this this

00:25:42,259 --> 00:25:46,639
conversation between both of them and

00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:51,139
what we're trying to achieve at least

00:25:46,639 --> 00:25:52,369
from my perspective is for them to have

00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:54,320
a meaningful conversation this is

00:25:52,369 --> 00:25:56,869
something that they've never had to do

00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:02,480
and this is something that I don't think

00:25:56,869 --> 00:26:05,149
any of us are trying to like break no

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,399
man and Katie and Elementary and all of

00:26:05,149 --> 00:26:09,230
us we need to keep working together and

00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:12,580
we'll continue doing so at so many

00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:16,100
levels like Waylon and and standards and

00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:19,490
well promo even but what matters is that

00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:21,230
when people create things well they can

00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:27,470
read the users in the best of the

00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:30,409
conditions I think the the important

00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:32,720
thing is just recognizing that the the

00:26:30,409 --> 00:26:34,909
the application ecosystem that is this

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,379
precondition of a success for Linux on

00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:38,149
the desktop is isn't bigger than any of

00:26:36,379 --> 00:26:40,039
our respective projects in a sense what

00:26:38,149 --> 00:26:42,860
what Alice was saying is we're all here

00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:44,600
to kind of allowing developers to

00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,930
succeed to give them tools where where

00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,220
they can

00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:48,650
actually produce applications and get

00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:50,270
them to users so this is already a kind

00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:53,060
of very kind of cooperative effort I

00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:54,650
think marketing is probably like a big

00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:56,690
missing piece and I know that the the

00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:58,970
global engagement team is also thinking

00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:01,430
about this of like how do we show kind

00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:02,810
of a bigger opportunity for developers

00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:05,090
to actually reach users how do we

00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:06,590
attract people to the Linux platform

00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:09,320
generally how do we kind of make it

00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:11,300
appealing to to publish there make it

00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,980
easier obviously know the tooling and

00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:15,080
and and they're kind of the friction

00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,820
that we have but then just telling that

00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,530
good story right of you know if you come

00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:20,090
here then we have tools that you can use

00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:22,040
to succeed we have users that you can

00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:23,630
reach due to the different channels and

00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:26,360
distributions and platforms that we have

00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:28,460
so yeah I think there's more cooperation

00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,200
but things like glass and and just

00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:33,260
working together in you know flat pack

00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,490
runtimes and platforms on snap store

00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,960
there there's there's so many different

00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:37,760
technical pieces we're doing but just

00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,850
building that bigger picture and just

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,070
selling it is very important all right

00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:45,290
short detail I think that only the fact

00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:48,290
that we're creating it's to three

00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:49,760
different desktop environments the the

00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:52,430
fact that we're creating very good ones

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,400
and all of the users that these

00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:56,660
brittany's is bringing to the linux

00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,700
ecosystem is already like working

00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:01,130
together in a way like we're allowing

00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:04,010
for very different mentalities to get

00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:05,510
into well this ecosystem that all of the

00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:11,000
application developers are leveraging

00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:12,680
right so from a marketing perspective I

00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,420
would say there's a there's three things

00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:20,870
one is on the learns tester we need to

00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:22,670
have software people warm and it's all

00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,440
very well as reaching out to users and

00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:26,090
saying your potential new users and

00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,690
saying hey there's this great Linux

00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:31,870
desktop you should try it sometime but

00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:35,420
when the question you know can I install

00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:37,940
this application for my light bulbs or

00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:40,040
can I ins build this application to talk

00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:42,020
to my friends or whatever it is we need

00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:44,810
to have those applications there so like

00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:46,250
we reach out to big software vendors and

00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:49,240
try and convince them to put their

00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:53,060
software in the snap store and that's a

00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:55,520
hard process because we all know what

00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:58,120
Linux desktop market share is and trying

00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,490
to convince a software developer to

00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,930
spend engineering effort to publish

00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:04,540
their software and support their

00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:07,090
software for those users is hard it's a

00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:09,160
hard thing to do and so we need to put

00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:12,550
more effort in to get that software into

00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:15,580
these these stores and repositories so

00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:17,110
that users have a compelling array of

00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:20,310
software once they arrive on our

00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:23,140
platform but the other thing I'd say is

00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:26,380
we need to go outside our bubble we need

00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:28,420
to be going where people are not where

00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:31,180
developers are not where users are we go

00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:33,700
where people are and people are places

00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:36,070
like farmers markets there are rock

00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:39,430
concerts there are places where normal

00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:41,740
people go and we need to be talking to

00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:44,350
those people and letting them know about

00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:47,290
the products and the portfolio of things

00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:50,680
that we have to offer them and as an

00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:53,920
example the French Ubuntu community go

00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:56,560
to music festivals and they have a

00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:58,830
pop-up tent with little thing that

00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,330
creates takes photos of you and

00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:03,670
publishes them online as animated gifs

00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:05,530
and it's a it's a little silly thing but

00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:07,780
it's all branded a bun - and you get

00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:09,550
little temporary tattoos and stickers

00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:11,530
and stuff and it's reaching out to

00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:13,060
people where they are it's not expecting

00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:14,710
them to come to us it's going to where

00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:19,080
they are and that's important and the

00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:21,880
final thing is I would speak to because

00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:25,540
most of us as organizations don't have

00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:27,300
giant marketing budgets get the

00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:29,770
community to do the marketing for us

00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:31,570
sometimes reaching out to a popular

00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:33,010
youtuber and saying hey we've got this

00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:34,870
product it's quite interesting might be

00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:37,150
good for your audience and feed them

00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:40,390
information I've given pre-written

00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:41,860
scripts to youtubers before and they

00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:44,800
appreciate that because they don't have

00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:46,630
to write a script and they create a

00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,630
video on our behalf it goes on their

00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:51,160
channel they get the ad revenue they get

00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:53,530
the clicks they get the subscriptions

00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:56,410
and we get the marketing to their

00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:58,360
audience so I think it's a multi-faceted

00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:02,830
approach and it takes a lot of effort

00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:05,740
but I think it's doable I think one of

00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:08,260
the biggest things that we need to do is

00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:10,770
stop calling our diversity fragmentation

00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:14,250
and we're not

00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:17,490
a group of like a fragmented Linux

00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:21,059
desktop that is infighting were a United

00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:22,710
group of diverse options for a lot of

00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:25,440
people and we work together constantly

00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:29,700
and I ping Alan all the time and

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,500
telegram and we like find ways to work

00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:35,370
with each other to make both elementary

00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:37,890
OS and Ubuntu better and I just you know

00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:41,309
emailed someone from KDE the other day

00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:43,169
that LS recommended to me so we can work

00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:45,539
together on something new upcoming and

00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:47,610
like you know I'm pinging Mateus and and

00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:50,340
Alex and and we're always talking to

00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:52,679
each other and we're all like I think at

00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:54,360
this point we're probably more United

00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:57,029
than we've been in a long time like the

00:31:54,360 --> 00:32:01,049
stack is super United right now and it's

00:31:57,029 --> 00:32:02,880
empowering us to build these awesome set

00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:05,610
of options that aren't as this

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,740
homogenous one-size-fits-all option like

00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:09,090
our competitors are trying to push this

00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,429
idea that everybody should use their

00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:13,830
computer the same way and that is our

00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:17,760
biggest strength is that we are diverse

00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:23,850
and it's not fragmented at all it's its

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:26,220
diversity yeah and I agree and I think

00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:28,320
we've actually always been able to work

00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,580
together on you from the earliest date

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,440
of the free desktop stuff we've been

00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:34,260
pretty good at working together on the

00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,630
lowest level stuff that has to work for

00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:39,299
for apps from different desktops and

00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:41,130
projects to work together I think the

00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:43,590
problem is in the wider community

00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:46,620
there's this image of us fighting and we

00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:48,360
have just sort of fight that and I think

00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:52,080
going to things like this where we

00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:53,880
co-host and brand together maybe you

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,230
know shows the community that actually

00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,700
we are working together and we've always

00:32:55,230 --> 00:33:01,049
been and it's just like the fringe

00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:03,000
community people who hate each other and

00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:04,710
kind of a follow on from that I have a

00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,529
good question from the audience

00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:10,799
and that is would it make sense to

00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:13,260
organize a Linux app centric conference

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:18,020
that caters more to the end users end

00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:18,020
users than to the developers

00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:24,280
maybe if somebody had the idea maybe

00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,560
they have a vision and they should voice

00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:29,770
it well in the right forums but in

00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:33,580
general my my feeling is that what

00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:35,320
matters is if an application once or

00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:37,270
application theme application community

00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,730
wants to talk about what they do they

00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:41,950
should be doing that we can talk a lot

00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:44,620
about the different products around

00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:47,820
Linux but we would also never end right

00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:50,940
so sure I don't know talk more maybe

00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:54,190
maybe something where we could have like

00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:55,870
one of the day is dedicated to end users

00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:59,590
or something where we can incorporate it

00:33:55,870 --> 00:34:01,360
in laughs yeah I think it it wouldn't

00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:03,760
necessarily to me it doesn't necessarily

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,410
make sense to say okay let's talk to an

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,000
audience of Linux app users I think it

00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:10,300
makes sense to possibly look at how do

00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,710
we bring together the Daniels point to

00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,330
bring together the the kind of diversity

00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:15,340
that we have so that we can actually

00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:16,930
talk to an audience of Linux users and

00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:19,930
then we could have you know device

00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:21,520
vendors you know OS distributors and app

00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:23,770
developers and you know the different

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,930
platforms and we could all kind of you

00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,850
know show show you show strength

00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:29,290
together and show that that this is

00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:30,880
actually a growing phenomenon that there

00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:31,990
is an increasing user base and demand

00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,670
and there are different channels to

00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:34,960
reach those users and that for app

00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:36,880
developers then there were there's a

00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,230
market to address like oh I can speak to

00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,390
all of these people and then I have

00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,920
something to say to them so I think

00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:44,970
there is some merit in trying to bring

00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:47,290
bring focus together on you know the

00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:48,490
user base but just to show that they

00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:49,750
exist them to show that the different

00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:51,190
ways that they can be successful than

00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,630
you know if you have a big event you

00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:54,970
know you go in the press and you know

00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:56,590
people are aware that Linux is the thing

00:34:54,970 --> 00:35:04,720
I can get it on my computer and it can

00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:07,060
have these great benefits for me so kind

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,410
of you know everybody wants to make

00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:12,480
money so kind of going back to the

00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:17,970
funding model have have some experts in

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:20,230
the funding areas been consulted like

00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:21,790
maybe not necessarily like economists

00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:25,930
but people that have kind of monetized

00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:28,059
things in the past have has anybody that

00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:32,299
you all know of

00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:34,190
experts well first we did have a talk

00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:38,690
about that right on the on the first day

00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:41,119
but what an example we have in in KD is

00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:44,839
crater that well they're not making much

00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:47,720
money in Linux but they actually got

00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:48,920
into the Windows Store and what I hear

00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:52,990
that they're doing pretty well over

00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:55,730
there and well it actually shows how

00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:57,380
being able to deliver the product in

00:35:55,730 --> 00:36:00,140
hand and have this conversation

00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:03,259
one-to-one with with with the users over

00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:05,029
there with their with a difference of of

00:36:03,259 --> 00:36:08,509
mentality that you would get on Windows

00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:10,759
and all things considered it has been

00:36:08,509 --> 00:36:13,190
definitely positive for them if it took

00:36:10,759 --> 00:36:15,049
them about it which you should if you

00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:16,910
don't because they have a very

00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:20,390
compelling story and they are very smart

00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:23,749
people well you will see that it has

00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:25,880
allowed them to create a load of a lot

00:36:23,749 --> 00:36:29,150
of software that otherwise they wouldn't

00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:31,670
have been able to do and I think that

00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:34,369
this is is it's clear that well having

00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:35,630
developers paid makes them well work on

00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:37,369
free software I think that this is

00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:40,609
obvious and it's all about this

00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:47,509
communication after all but I haven't

00:36:40,609 --> 00:36:50,390
talked to economists about it so I

00:36:47,509 --> 00:36:52,460
haven't talked to any economists but a

00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:54,470
lot of people might not know that my

00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:57,019
background hasn't always been software I

00:36:54,470 --> 00:37:02,170
actually I spend a lot of time in

00:36:57,019 --> 00:37:06,049
restaurants and I managed a small

00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:08,930
pizzeria for a while and I worked my way

00:37:06,049 --> 00:37:11,749
up at another restaurant where I was

00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:14,809
working pretty closely with the CEO on

00:37:11,749 --> 00:37:18,140
kind of their branding and marketing and

00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:20,779
strategy and things like that and so I

00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:22,849
kind of I have a background that's not

00:37:20,779 --> 00:37:25,999
just in producing open-source software

00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:28,279
but in kind of looking at things from

00:37:25,999 --> 00:37:31,989
like how do we make a business that's

00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:37,009
successful in self-sustaining and so I

00:37:31,989 --> 00:37:41,270
think that you don't necessarily need to

00:37:37,009 --> 00:37:44,780
look at like scholars or a condom

00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:46,730
or anything to have a little bit more of

00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:49,190
like a practical business sense and just

00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:51,830
getting people that have a different

00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:53,720
perspective of like howdy regular small

00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:56,090
businesses run in the world and let's

00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:59,030
look at our organizations kind of from

00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:01,250
that perspective a little bit more of we

00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:03,160
need to have like a self-sustaining

00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:06,740
business

00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:08,990
so we've I don't know about the

00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:13,580
economics as in speaking to economists

00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:15,710
but I I speak to developers a lot and we

00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:19,040
had a software developer reach out to us

00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:21,950
and say we've got an application

00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,530
we'd like to spread it among the Linux

00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:28,160
community we think the Linux users would

00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:30,410
like it can you help us and so we helped

00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:33,200
them package their application up we put

00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:35,600
it in the snap store and we wrote a blog

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:38,660
post about it we did social media posts

00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:41,630
about it we featured it in the desktop

00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:43,280
app store and that drove users to

00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:44,720
install the application now this

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,490
particular application is a subscription

00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:50,300
service so you get it free for 30 days

00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:52,190
and then if you like it you pay and they

00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:54,200
were really hesitant their leadership

00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:55,940
team were really hesitant about putting

00:38:54,200 --> 00:39:00,050
in the investment to port the

00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:01,550
application to Linux because they

00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:04,070
weren't sure that they would recoup that

00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:06,350
investment and thankfully they have

00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:08,660
partly because we promoted it so much

00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:10,130
and you know we featured it and did

00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:12,770
social posts and all that kind of stuff

00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:14,540
to raise awareness among the user

00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:17,660
community that this thing exists and

00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:20,750
it's good and so they we could leverage

00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:23,090
our you know social media presence and

00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:25,640
the eyeballs that are on our blog in

00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:28,310
order to help that software developer

00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:30,980
they've written medium posts and blog

00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:33,920
posts to talk about how it was a success

00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:35,780
and how it was difficult because the

00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,630
elephant in the room is we don't have a

00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:40,790
huge market share and so as a leche was

00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:43,820
saying you publish an open-source

00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:45,410
application in the Windows Store and if

00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:47,390
it's a good application you're probably

00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:49,880
going to get more installs of that

00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:53,119
application in a few months than you

00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:56,930
will in maybe a few years

00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:59,480
Desktop or maybe ever offers desktop and

00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:01,759
so we need to be mindful of that when

00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,140
we're talking to developers and not over

00:40:01,759 --> 00:40:05,059
promise that they're going to make

00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:07,730
millions selling their desktop

00:40:05,059 --> 00:40:08,569
application to Linux users but if

00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:10,249
they're okay

00:40:08,569 --> 00:40:12,109
spending a percentage of their

00:40:10,249 --> 00:40:14,450
development time and effort porting

00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:16,940
their applications on Linux and we can

00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:18,769
help promote that and push it when it's

00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:25,339
possible it will pay for itself and

00:40:18,769 --> 00:40:29,390
maybe a bit more so if if a user pays

00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:31,220
for an application how can we kind of

00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:32,779
ensure that the user is going to get a

00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:35,680
certain amount of quality because they

00:40:32,779 --> 00:40:38,390
paid for that you know there's always a

00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,430
varying level of quality depending on

00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:43,490
the app you know how maintained is that

00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:45,470
how often are new features introduced so

00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:47,799
how does someone know that this app is

00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:49,730
worth you know five dollars or whatever

00:40:47,799 --> 00:40:52,700
and it's actually a very complicated

00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:55,190
question because use is the act of

00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:57,799
paying changes people's perspective of

00:40:55,190 --> 00:41:00,440
your thing it turns into a product and

00:40:57,799 --> 00:41:01,759
you're suddenly like have requirements

00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:05,140
that you didn't have before when it was

00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:08,720
more of a gift so I think it's all about

00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:10,970
how you sell the fact that that's like

00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,440
you're not buying us used it's still an

00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:13,670
open-source project that it's someone

00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,369
someone is doing in their spare time or

00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:20,739
whatever but it's still worth paying for

00:41:16,369 --> 00:41:22,880
that to make it better but you might not

00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:24,049
be able to have the same kind of

00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,640
requirements that you have on a

00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:29,029
commercial product to have like a

00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:35,390
commercial backing so it's all about how

00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:39,259
you how you phrase like did you call it

00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:43,430
donations you call it payments how do

00:41:39,259 --> 00:41:45,499
you message it basically yeah I mean

00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:46,609
maybe down was think is things anything

00:41:45,499 --> 00:41:50,029
we were talking about this yesterday

00:41:46,609 --> 00:41:51,380
that that some there's if you're not

00:41:50,029 --> 00:41:53,029
requiring your payments then people can

00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:54,289
also try the application then you know

00:41:53,029 --> 00:41:55,519
you need to go back and have a kind of

00:41:54,289 --> 00:41:57,619
second bite at the cherry and if there's

00:41:55,519 --> 00:42:00,319
an upgrade or two weeks later we remind

00:41:57,619 --> 00:42:02,349
people about of payments so the there

00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,400
are different ways to kind of change the

00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:06,170
transaction so that you could either get

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,350
a refund or get a free period and

00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:10,910
later but you know too much people

00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:12,200
towards supporting the applications

00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:13,700
they're using if they keep using them

00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:16,820
and they find a good experience there

00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:18,440
but not to sort of create this kind of

00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:21,290
pressure like well I paid five bucks and

00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,880
this is terrible and you know so this

00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:27,320
would be kind of a balance and we need

00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:33,440
to find that you know something that's

00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:34,970
interesting that you kind of always have

00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,080
to consider the history of things when

00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,070
you're working on things right because

00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,360
somebody else has always solved this

00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:41,240
problem we don't want to solve the same

00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:45,470
problems over and over again and we find

00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:47,270
that like in our regular markets that

00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:49,870
governments have created regulations

00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:52,520
right and we have regulated products and

00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:54,260
we have consumer protections and that's

00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:57,140
kind of how we know that we can go to a

00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:58,280
grocery store and we can buy a piece of

00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,960
fruit and that it's not going to be

00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:03,710
poisoned is because the government has

00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:06,290
has enforced the regulations right so I

00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:09,920
think that's something that we need to

00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:11,840
consider and that elementary kind of has

00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,740
built into the model of our marketplace

00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:17,540
is that we do have a certain human

00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:19,130
review process an automated testing

00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:20,900
process and we have certain guarantees

00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:22,670
that we want to pass to our users and

00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:24,620
they know that when they step into our

00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:26,900
marketplace that there's a value there

00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:30,080
that they're going to get a product that

00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:33,530
is functioning to a certain extent like

00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:35,830
by the by the way that it's enforced in

00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:38,780
the marketplace and I think that that's

00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:40,550
that's a big part of an guaranteeing

00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:44,810
that value is that kind of regulation

00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:46,460
kind of curation concept there's also

00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:49,160
some additional value that the app

00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:51,230
developer gets from Linux users and we

00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:54,740
we have this from the story I previously

00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:57,050
told there the developer published their

00:43:54,740 --> 00:44:00,080
application for Linux and then said to

00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:01,910
us actually publishing for Linux is

00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,950
beneficial to us not just for the

00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:07,820
monetary side but actually the Linux

00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:10,130
users give us better bug reports than

00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:12,920
the Windows and Mac users they're they

00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:15,290
write more articulate more detailed more

00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:17,180
well-structured

00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:19,640
blog reports that are actionable and we

00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:22,070
can actually fix them that will benefit

00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:24,590
the Windows and Mac users as well so

00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:27,680
there are side benefits to this that are

00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:29,990
not just monetary and yes if a linux

00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,840
user reports a bug and it gets fixed and

00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:34,970
benefits a Windows user or benefits like

00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:37,130
100 windows users those my turning to

00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:42,080
paid users and you know it keeps the

00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:43,580
cycle game yeah ok and we're almost out

00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:46,580
of time but there's a question that's

00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:50,120
quite popular in the crowd and so are

00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:51,800
the members of the board here still

00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:55,850
interested in the free desktop or

00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:58,010
project project and if so then can we

00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:59,960
push that harder to create a central

00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:05,030
developer workflow or would we need a

00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:06,710
new platform to do this and I think the

00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:08,150
the free desert project I've been

00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:10,850
through variously involved with over

00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:13,010
many years it has almost a kind of dual

00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:16,880
identity and it actually started from

00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:19,370
this cooperation zone between durman KDE

00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,890
to agree on standards about icons and

00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:24,020
launchers and things and it also then

00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:25,610
became a kind of natural home to host

00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:27,830
infrastructure components that were also

00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:29,930
shared so a lot of the Linux graphics

00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:33,260
stack that X when and me so all of these

00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:34,790
things live in free desktop and in a

00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:36,890
sense because there are more developers

00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:38,750
and more activity there that's sort of

00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:41,690
the the status quo of that organization

00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:43,220
is it it helps those projects so it's

00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:44,960
kind of the folks who are running it and

00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:46,430
I could've choosing what happens on free

00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,860
desktop but those folks who are the

00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:49,820
right those infrastructure pieces I

00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:51,500
don't know if we kind of need to go and

00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:52,850
reboot a little bit and maybe sort of

00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,530
elevate some of the activities that

00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:56,180
we're doing here and say well actually

00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:57,830
we're going to move these you know

00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:59,150
outside of Gromack ad and actually put

00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:01,670
them into free desktop so that's one

00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:03,470
possibility or the other one is that we

00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:05,270
then could have reach above grama KT and

00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:06,650
create a different structure that it's

00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:08,600
talking specifically about this app

00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:10,580
story and they're both possible I mean

00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,780
there's a the first thing was we need to

00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:13,910
go in speak to the people who currently

00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:15,200
run free desktop and then see what they

00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:17,300
think right and they're like well oh I'm

00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:19,190
happy with my here leave me sir and then

00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:21,980
okay well maybe we we don't go there but

00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:25,060
it kind of started doing one thing and

00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:28,070
ended up doing another to some extent I

00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:29,030
think I'm mud is a simpler answer it

00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:31,400
would be

00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:33,860
we did something over there that is a

00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:37,160
shared space it can be free desktop if

00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:40,580
some of you feel well tied to free

00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:43,340
desktop and want to work together better

00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:45,410
than we are doing nowadays come forward

00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:47,870
and we will make free desktop this space

00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:49,820
if we desktop the people involved in

00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:53,470
Podesta today the one it to be this

00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:59,870
space we will do the best of free.org or

00:46:53,470 --> 00:47:03,200
freedom of desktop whatever we need

00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:05,510
something it can be Podesta it really

00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,970
doesn't matter I mean they're very

00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:09,860
friendly people it's just that for us to

00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:11,240
be doing the work there we'd have to

00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,260
just go over there and do it but the

00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:15,380
people are doing the work wherever

00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:19,810
they're sitting so and the very fact

00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:26,780
that we're calling they instead of we is

00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:29,650
well symptomatic right so we're pretty

00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:31,880
agnostic in terms of like desktop

00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:34,670
technologies yes our default desktop is

00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:38,390
you know but our repository contains

00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:41,090
many different desktops and we have many

00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:42,530
users who use Kubuntu and Marte and many

00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:44,510
of those things that leverage stuff

00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:45,890
that's in the free desktop world in

00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:47,900
terms of like the developer

00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:49,880
documentation and developer portal kind

00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:55,010
of things we've tried this in the past

00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:58,880
it's it's really difficult to to to do

00:47:55,010 --> 00:48:01,340
for us because we're is so agnostic

00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,470
about what other technologies people use

00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:06,410
on what desktops people use unlike I'm

00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:09,680
sure that we'll mention they have quite

00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:11,840
a an opinionated strict you know these

00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,580
are our developer guidelines and here's

00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,930
our recommendation we're more relaxed

00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:16,760
we've tried this in the past to do

00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:19,040
develop a documentation that say you

00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:21,320
know use this language use this toolkit

00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,090
here's how you do it but then someone

00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:24,800
comes along and says but I want to do it

00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:27,050
with a different toolkit or I want to do

00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,620
with a different language and then the

00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:32,360
documentation prolific proliferate and

00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:34,280
nobody keeps it up today and it just

00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:35,810
falls by the wayside so we've kind of

00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,970
given up with the idea of creating a

00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:40,190
developer portal of documentation it

00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:41,730
with in Ubuntu but I'd love for us to

00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:43,830
collaborate on something

00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:46,100
we dust up and you know move that fool

00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:48,420
what that would be awesome

00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:52,590
yeah I think like Alan said it's it's

00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:55,740
really challenging to try to agree on

00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:57,690
like a single developer path when we

00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:59,460
have such a diverse set of desktops and

00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:02,850
I don't think that's necessarily a

00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:06,300
realistic goal to have but I think that

00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:08,910
like the ideas of cooperation between

00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:11,820
the desktops is still very much alive

00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:13,890
whether that means it happens on

00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:17,100
freedesktop.org or in a certain

00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:20,010
repository like we're all here today and

00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:23,150
this organization may not know if we are

00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:25,680
free desktop or not but we're here

00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:27,390
collaborating and and we still call

00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:33,030
stuff free desktop all the time

00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:34,950
regardless so all right well that's all

00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:38,520
the time we have thank you all very much

00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:39,900
for your answers to all the great

00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:43,109
questions thanks for the audience for

00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:44,700
all of the great questions yeah thank

00:49:43,109 --> 00:49:47,869
thanks everybody so let's give them a

00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,869
round of applause

00:49:52,640 --> 00:50:02,550
and thank you to Heather for moderating

00:49:55,710 --> 00:50:04,349
