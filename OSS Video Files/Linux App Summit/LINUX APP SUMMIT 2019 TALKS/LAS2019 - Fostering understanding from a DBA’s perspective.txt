hello everyone mostly my conversation is

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:13,139
more or less like a story of my journey

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:15,719
so far I started out as a data from a

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,060
management perspective which was finance

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:21,840
accounting and management and during

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,609
most of my my time I just want to

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,640
explain to you my experience we sought

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,980
fostering understanding so understanding

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,349
first of all for me as a person and then

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:36,450
the users my users mostly we're the

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:38,579
stakeholders so I started off doing

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,010
accounting jobs and as a man and

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,140
management but during our stakeholder

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,559
meetings I noticed there was easier

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,329
issues with lingos the IT team and this

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,910
management they didn't seem to

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,160
understand each other's perspective of

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,260
Fame's in coming together to put a

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,680
product together and that I talked to

00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:01,230
myself ok what if I just try to get to

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,809
understand of IT and then maybe I can

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:08,939
bridge that gap I didn't know what I was

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:11,369
getting myself into and then and then I

00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:13,229
went for training and I saw this what's

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:15,750
in the I thought Excel was crazy and

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:19,200
then I ended up with a command prompt

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,689
and I thought to myself ok this is a

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,700
challenge if I am having this problem

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:25,140
then I can understand where management

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,540
is coming from when we're trying to

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,100
break down the databases and how do you

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,030
are connected and entity relational

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,710
diagrams and then I also had my train

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,890
and I discovered that management when I

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,900
try to explain with that platform I saw

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,700
that management by switching off quite

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,140
quickly and scratching and just trying

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:48,960
to get off can we just finish this

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:51,210
already and then the GUI came thanks to

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,460
Katie and Noam and other platforms or

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:59,280
the graphical user interface it made it

00:01:53,460 --> 00:02:00,719
easier because Mike Mike my my my users

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,210
were not basically people using

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,979
applications it's talking to people to

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,920
make something happen for profit

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:11,280
purposes on average and then when I try

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,410
to explain this database and stop with

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,480
entity diagrams

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,600
understood better they could see things

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,120
they could relate to and even if it's

00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,000
not perfect there was progress with

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,420
regards to management and one thing I

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
can always say is this as much as you

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:33,360
develop stuff do us a favor

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,580
to consider users perspective use the

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,990
graphical interface wherever you can or

00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,580
something that people can relate to

00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,500
there's something about being able to

00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,990
relate to your customers or your users

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,840
if you can try your little best as much

00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:47,760
as you can to push that bit not look at

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,800
things from just your perspective but

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,450
from their perspective you might be able

00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,580
to bridge the gap we're talking about

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:57,390
and reduce the number of problems we

00:02:53,580 --> 00:03:01,320
have you know between the developers and

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:03,510
the end users and for me it's been a

00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:06,540
beautiful experience so far there's

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:09,000
still more to do but so far with GUI

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,320
it's been a lot better and thank you

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:18,259
everyone that's from all for me

00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:18,259
