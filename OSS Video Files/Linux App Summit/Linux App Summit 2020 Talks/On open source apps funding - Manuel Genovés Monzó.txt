Description: 
	On OSS Funding
It's well known: OSS is underfunded. That has a lot of implications in several levels, which I won't discuss here. Just for the sake of completeness, I'm gonna point a few of them:

OSS maintainers need to eat. Since OSS doesn't usually let people make a living out of it, they end with other day jobs. That means OSS projects are always at risk of becoming unmaintained, and increases the bus factor of projects a lot.

While OSS maintainers aren't able to monetize their work, big companies usually do, which is at least problematic.

That also means the culture surrounding Linux is "everything is free", so it's less attractive to new developers which want make a living out of their programming. That means a smaller app ecosystem, with a lot of abandonware.

People are not money-grubbing
The truth is, people want to pay for things! And software is no exception: see how well the AppStore or Steam do in that regard, so what's the issue with OSS? Why people don't throw money at developers?

OSS is a model based in charity
Say donations, say charity. Even if factually donating 5𝑡𝑜𝑆𝑜𝑚𝑒𝐴𝑝𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑏𝑢𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑓𝑜𝑟5 is the same, psychologically those are two very different things

On the perceived value
We live in a capitalist world, and we cannot omit that in our analysis. In capitalism value and perceived value are by no means the same thing, and perceived value scales with the price point put to something, not by their inherent value. Even more important, the price point doesn't necessarily need to match the price the customer ends paying. That's why sales work as a commercial strategy: you put the value with the original price tag, and by making a sale you offer customers the idea that they may get the same value by paying less.

If OSS is offered without a price tag, people just will assume its value is lower than the same product with a price tag, even if you allow to not pay anything at the end.

More on that: even if we hope to value an app by their inherent interest, that valoration will never be accurate. Developers don't know how to predict how many hours of development a task will take, regular people even less. Since things Just Work TM is easy to assume that things were easy to develop. The strategy of putting an "hours invested in this" is widely used in web products, I think we can assume with some success.

Friction and expectations
Even if the user knows the value of the app they want to use, probably they won't donate to it a cent. This is due to two things: friction and expectations. I'll talk first about the latter.

While a donation-based model lowers the fear of loss you may have in a payment-based model, it ups user expectations a lot. Why is that? If we think about other donation-based models they're usually built around the idea of "we're doing a public good and we need your trust and money to keep doing it". Well, trust is a hard thing to give, and you usually want the money you donate to be well employed. Not only that: money given to donations usually is a low-priority, highly constrained part of your typical budget. If in the mental model of someone there is X money for groceries, Y money for non necessary things, and Z money for charity, you're directly competing for a quite constrained budget with some high moral non-profits. Not the best place to be for a text editor.

Then you have friction, and it affects both charity-based and payment-based models. It's easy: given two paths, people will always follow the one of least resistance. And friction plays a huge role on that. If it's easier to pirate than to pay $2, people will pirate.

It suffices to say that having a donation link inside an About dialog which opens a new window and then asks you to input your credit card, your PIN, then check your mobile to confirm the transaction... won't work. Is way easier to just keep using the application. If each time you want to buy an app in Software you need to do about the same, people will avoid selecting paid apps.

The path to a frictionless paid ecosystem
Say we implement payments on GNOME. That needs to be done on a Platform level, for several reasons:

We need the payment system to be trustable
We need it to be a fairly centralized system who offers an API to applications - again, trust
We need it to be frictionless: you put your payment data once, and after that if you want to make a payment you just press a button.
We need to offer incentives for entering the payment data:
In all seriousness this could be a very interesting point for GNOME to offer some services (config backups, secure mail, cloud services for enabling apps to have cloud capabilities such as sync of data, who knows)
And on top of all of that, we need to put a price to our apps even if we go a pay-what-you-want route, and/or showcase how much work goes into making them.

hi good morning

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,640
or evening wherever you are

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:17,920
okay so

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:21,199
i'm manuel genovese

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,840
i'm a racist developer and artist

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,119
i'm going to talk about open source

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,519
funding

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:33,040
today you might know me as i am the

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:37,520
apostrophe maintainer and unknown

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,520
a foundation and foundation member

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,640
but who i am not i'm not a

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,520
non-representative nor a lawyer

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,039
nor an economist this will be an issue

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,039
with my points of view

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,039
so take it with a reign offset

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,039
now before i speak i'm gonna talk about

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,320
app funding

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,879
being that we are you know sub summit

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,119
desktop funding and libraries funding

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,760
are just as important

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,640
the stocks are the base of our the user

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,720
experience

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,479
and libraries are at the core of

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,520
everything but to have

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,560
all these uh missing apps

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,680
we need to we need to fund everything

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,640
you cannot have a sane ecosystem if the

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,479
base is

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,080
not well maintained and sadly libraries

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,200
are not the best well-funded thing in

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,960
the world

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,799
for example we all remember what

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,799
happened with openssl

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,200
open ssl was time

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,799
yet two-thirds of the websites at the

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,040
time depend on it

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,320
heart bleed but the world the whole

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,200
internet in a whole

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,759
but also put the issue of libraries

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,040
funding

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,119
on the spot early library funding is a

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,799
quite complex topic and i won't have

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,880
time to discuss it today

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,880
so let's talk about apps

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,959
now money is the world as we know it

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,160
you want to eat to life to exist you

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,720
need money

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,840
that is you for open source developers

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,400
because as we all know

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,840
open source doesn't give a lot of money

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,319
or better fast

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,680
it doesn't give a lot of money of money

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:26,080
to open source develop

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,080
because companies profit a lot from it

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:33,280
when i say a lot

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:36,959
i mean see the case of netflix

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,000
netflix report a 20 billion usd

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:44,080
dollars revenue and our 2 billion

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,160
on income in 2019.

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,440
netflix is a company that heavily

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,480
depends on python

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:54,160
at this at his core there are lots

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,800
and lots of python yet python only made

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,000
three million dollars in revenue and

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,440
half a million

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,440
i think in the same year

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:08,879
netflix a funds a python

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:12,159
netflix is in the a donor half

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:16,000
of fame of python yet there are

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,080
another companies like spotify or amazon

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,040
who also depend on python yet they don't

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,200
fund it

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,680
or less er not publicly

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,319
that means that people usually end skip

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,120
giving up

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,159
on projects in favor of more profitable

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,959
day jobs

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,040
this is the frequency graph of my commit

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,760
son apostrophe

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,959
this empty song is when i was hired by a

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,360
big company to the

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,200
to work i didn't love to be honest

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,680
believe me i'd rather be

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,120
have been improving apostrophe but i

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,080
needed the money so i

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,560
stopped contributing to the project all

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,560
this time

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,280
let me be clear the rest of the

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,959
presentation i'll be talking on how to

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,519
apply by capitalist rules

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,200
but we must acknowledge that the

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,920
underlying issue

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,400
society functions around the concept of

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,159
extracting profit from perceived value

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,680
and that clashes frontally with

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,079
activities such as

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,959
source development but we are not alone

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,359
in that

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,560
artists for example have been dealing

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,560
with this for a long time

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,840
i have the moral need to point to the

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,560
root tissue and to radical solutions

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,040
here

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,680
take political actions if you want some

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,960
sensible improvements in this problem

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,160
depends on many benefits societies such

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,759
as art

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,759
or science but but is almost exclusively

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,120
fundraised by the means of the people

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,400
who can afford it

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,120
to give it time such as art or science

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,479
in

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,479
another time as a painting portraits

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,800
how does of this arts and science

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,280
a basic science a in construct in

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,320
contrast with applied

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,120
science applies science does seek an

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,000
returning investment usually so private

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,440
companies

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,800
fund applies science but basic science

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,199
the kind of science

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,479
which doesn't seek an immediate return

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,160
of the investment

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,960
is no other is a heavy public fund and a

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,320
key towards

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,639
society's well-being i mean this is

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,639
cern

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,560
it's a lot of money it could be better

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,039
but

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,919
this is a lot of money and this is a lot

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,960
of money

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,440
not direct towards a benefit

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,360
just we know science is important we

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,680
fund it

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,960
an art in the same same

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,919
center in the uh there are

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,120
artistic residencies and there are at

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,560
artistic resident

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,520
the public fund all around the world

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,199
every city has at least one museum with

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,520
publicly acquired art

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,080
that's common we are used to fun

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,319
activities which while not being

00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,520
capitalizable

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,240
benefit society as a whole now

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,560
what about us i think is training we ask

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,280
society to start sponsoring not only big

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,680
open source

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,039
projects but also individuals and small

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,639
applications

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,560
or even better we can ask our

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,600
politicians something like universal

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,479
basic income

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,199
which will solve a lot of these problems

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,919
and it

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,639
might sound like an utopia but right now

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,199
there are

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,280
proposals you can sign to ask that in

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,960
the european parliament

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:52,639
especially after the pandemic

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,520
this is becoming a a common thing to ask

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,479
for

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,919
in fact if you want to sign this there

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,960
is the link

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,960
and a qr

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,000
now we shall explore as well the not so

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,319
obvious path of

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,960
universities universities have been the

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,440
way society allocates public resources

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,000
for arts and science for a long time

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,000
there is a lot of money there and it's a

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,880
good opportunity for developing

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,880
a good open source software

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,440
monetization of open source applications

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,160
is a faceted

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,000
problem today we'll take all three

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,960
aspects of it

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,720
the socialists i've been talking a

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,000
little bit about this one

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,800
the cultural issues which are the

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,840
natural consequences of the first ones

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,759
and

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,120
the psychological issues which are

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,520
entirety or fault

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,400
and also always better if we want to

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,440
change things

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,440
for our community

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,840
the social issue

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,280
i'm not going to explain down how market

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,160
standard capital is

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,800
one easy concept to an unknown grasp is

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,360
that the perceived value

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,479
is the actual value of the product is in

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,479
this difference

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,680
between those two values where profit is

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,840
made in fact

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,599
now a lot of things influence that

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,759
perceived value

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,680
but one of the most important ones is

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:30,080
the price tag we put in it

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,440
but good things don't come cheap and we

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,000
then condition

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,320
our whole life with that premise that's

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,320
why raising the price often raises the

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,519
perceived value of the product it

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,080
reference

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,599
that directly plays in our disadvantage

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,360
since science-free products

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,200
automatically are perceived

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,920
as worse than their commercial

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,920
counterparts

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,000
so that is known as the revlon effect

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,240
and is used

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,440
a lot by companies such as the automatic

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,040
industry

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,000
a well-known example audi and volkswagen

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,920
cars

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,080
and now they may not cost much more than

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,440
their control power to manufacture

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,279
it costs a lot more to the customer

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,360
and just because of that is why more

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,760
these are desirable by the

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,760
public

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,600
interestingly interestingly enough there

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,560
is a situation where the

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,120
world free mobile mobilized hundreds of

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,959
people

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,160
and that's when something that was a

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,959
paid product is of

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,959
for free at some point the price tag

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,600
helps to set the perceived value

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,560
regarded regardlessly of what you buy at

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,320
the end

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,880
that's how these coins work it's a basic

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,880
strategy

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,240
we are not the only ones with this issue

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,399
see spain

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,920
known for one of the best public health

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,720
care programs in the world

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,519
or at least that's what we like to say

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,880
to anyone

00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:01,120
anyone willing to listen it is

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,920
universal and free health care program

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,560
which covers

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,560
almost everything yet precisely

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,800
people underestimates how much costs

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,560
the operation they just have there are

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,279
people who think that we should include

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,680
a deal

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,800
even if at the end of it says everything

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,360
is subsidized

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,959
or so something like that preciously

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,920
because of this

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,480
and this also provokes another problem

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,839
which is

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:33,839
entitlement but i'll be talking that

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,839
later

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,240
there's yet another things that plays in

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,320
our disadvantage

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,519
i'm sure a lot of you know this

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,320
situation

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:50,480
we're very bad at estimating costs

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:54,480
yesterday we had a talk on gtk 4.

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,959
it doubled the the estimation of time it

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,680
will take to develop it

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,680
we all have been faulty at this kind of

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,160
thing

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,880
usually implementing that easy function

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,040
costs us

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,040
four times more than what we thought

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,399
time is deceiving it is for us

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,040
and it is even more for our users clean

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,160
need that seem to be easy to develop

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,640
usually

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,760
are the ones that take longer to develop

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,320
and in a world where

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,360
time is money that means that users will

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:29,839
consistently

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:29,839
underestimate how much a project costs

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,959
on cultural issues

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,680
we've been feeding the idea that

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,320
everything that linux land is in

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,720
and should be free as in money and in

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,880
fact

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,279
that's usually one of the hooks we use

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,440
to attract people to this world

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,600
except that nothing is free and the

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,399
costs of free software are assumed by

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,959
the

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,399
developers as i was telling at the start

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,120
of the talk

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,639
promoting a culture of everything not

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,560
only has consequences

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,040
on the perceived value of what we have

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,880
to opt to offer

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:11,200
see this is a linux summit a

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,160
photo from last year it's a beautiful

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,760
photo

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,959
it shows as well something i like a lot

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:23,200
about this community which is diversity

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:26,560
but diversity is several impact

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:30,480
when we don't offer economic crush

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:34,720
especially for groups of people

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:39,839
we are already

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,839
discriminated by society

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,880
this is a graph it shows male female and

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,480
non-binary people

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:52,480
but polls usually don't take nominal

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:55,839
people into account 22.

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,440
percent of developers are female but in

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,480
open source

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,360
only three percent are female and only

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,399
one percent

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:08,079
are non-binary

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:11,279
same goes for as many minorities

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:15,200
if 34 34 of

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,639
developers are from an ethnic minority

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,880
in open source

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:24,320
only 16 percent are

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,959
by being free we also there are a lot of

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,920
issues here

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,880
uh i i'm not gonna pretend money money

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,920
is the only issue

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,959
but definitely having

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,880
a system with a encourages

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,800
people who have the means of

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:43,360
contributing because they have

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,360
free time or economic question

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,839
contributors though to to this

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:57,680
no on psychological issues

00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:00,880
i'm going to recapitulate a little bit

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,560
a donation based model uh lowers the

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,240
fear of loss you might have

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:09,600
in a payment based model it helps

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,639
their expectations a lot so why is that

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,360
if we think about a other donation based

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,360
models

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,279
they they are usually built around the

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,279
day of we are doing a public good

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,639
and we need your trust and money to keep

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,680
doing it

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,760
well trust is a hard thing to give and

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,079
you usually want the money you donate to

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:33,600
be well employed

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:38,959
uh only that this is a our phone

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:42,079
a typical european a yearly budget

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:45,680
you have housing which amounts for

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:48,880
one quarter of the total income a

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:52,320
full transport this

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:57,120
square that is donations

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,120
the white big square are other things

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:04,160
some things two whatever the red

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,160
square is donations

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:12,240
uh we are competing putting ourselves

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:16,160
in that red square with

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,560
this kind of foundations and nonprofits

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,680
we are comparing a text editor with

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,399
intermonox fan

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,399
for example

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,560
that that is a bad place to be we want

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,759
to compete with

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:35,440
other fun things or

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:40,800
tools or whatever the user is

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:44,000
spending their money not with charities

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,959
also that leads to a user entitlement

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,920
as i was saying before i think everyone

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,120
has experienced

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:55,440
it any developer this was a

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:58,639
an ecu open in non calendar

00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,720
a common issue we want a holidays of our

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:04,000
country as calendar events

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:07,440
but they start to

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,720
make very very entire claims

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:14,240
like even apple does what users ask

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:17,680
for i mean you are telling tattoo

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,600
a person which is devoting their free

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,920
time to give you a product

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,720
and you are still asking things like you

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,720
deserve them

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:36,959
no friction is another issue we have

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,959
which affects both device models and

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:44,560
and pay what you want models or that

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:47,120
but it affects us say someone

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,360
perceived to all value your app and is

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,000
willing to donate some money to it

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,040
or even to comply with the price you set

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,399
in a pi what

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,120
you want model probably it won't donate

00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,800
at the end

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,440
and that's because of the friction of

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,440
the process

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:09,520
see let's see how they donate a

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,959
workflow goes for a regular fragments

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,559
it's arbitrary

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,199
app it's very nice i want to donate to

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,439
it

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:22,000
so i open the menu go to the add

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,000
fragments

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:28,079
item and a pop pop

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,280
opens there is a link to the gitlab

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,679
homepage

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,440
i click it there are a lot of things in

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,160
the gitlab page

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,480
i scroll down there is a button to

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,120
download on flat hub

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,320
we will there and there there it is i

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,440
don't need button

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,320
which takes the deliver a page of

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,080
of the level developer and we still have

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,000
to make an account on liverp

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,120
if we don't have one and we still have

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,360
to enter or

00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:00,480
payment details and go to the phone and

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,679
enter the pin the cascade event

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,720
asks us it's a process with a lot of

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,120
friction and

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,000
as you see us continue using the app

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,280
with

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,679
doing anything given to paths people

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,120
will

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,440
always follow the one of learn

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,480
resistance

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,360
easier to buy pirate than to pay two

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,679
dollars people will pay out

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,280
luckily that goes both ways if we make

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,640
easier to pay

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:31,919
people will pay

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:35,360
i mean those companies are built around

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:38,640
that concept steam or netflix

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:41,600
made easier to enter the payment data

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,400
once and then forget about it

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,039
you have a whole catalog of games or

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,960
movies

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:51,840
uh whatever and people pay because

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,559
it's easier to do that than to be

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,160
searching on

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:59,440
davies forums amazon and paypal

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,320
uh those are companies that profit

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,120
from you paying through their platform

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,320
so they

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:09,039
them they make paying super easy

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,799
you only have to click one button to

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:14,960
make a purchase on amazon

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,960
or to send money with python

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:23,679
we when if we make the the path smooth

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:26,880
people will pay it's as easy as that

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,679
no give me actual solutions

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,919
i i don't have them really said that in

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:35,600
my opinion our best bet comes from

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:37,280
public money in any case let me give you

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,320
a bit of warning before

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,720
giving some tips and tricks of things we

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,720
could do

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:50,000
beware of successes

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:54,240
krita those are great apps everybody

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,559
knows them they are a sustainable

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,720
but the amount of apps which are

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:02,080
sustainable is very very small

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,080
this is like a football

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:10,080
music groups or football

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,799
i mean regular business the percentage

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,039
of people

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,200
who succeed is by no means representing

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:18,880
for the authority of the

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,840
of the businesses or programs or music

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,840
groups

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,600
beware of growth funding for the

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,320
majority of people

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,520
it doesn't work for some thus i'm not

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,679
saying don't try it

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,880
i'm just saying be careful with your

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,240
expectations

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,240
as they can deceive you

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,480
a lot of people even very good

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,200
developers

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,000
which contribute a lot don't make it

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,240
through

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,320
a liberal pie or through patreon

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,880
you were this is a little bit more

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:56,080
serious serious

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:59,360
i don't know if you know dante's source

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,520
it changes hands it happens a lot of

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,799
things with it

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:07,039
it's a platform where you uh where

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,000
there are the issues of projects and you

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,320
pay a

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,720
for a an issue to be solved and the

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,960
developer developer who

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:20,720
solves that that issue is the one who

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:24,080
can claim that money monthly source

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,480
have some problems some public

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,760
backslash but i want to talk

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,679
specifically

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:34,400
about the effect the turn cobra effect

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,280
originated in an alert anecdote that

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,760
describes an

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,720
occurrence during india under british

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,720
rule

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,960
the british government was concerned

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,280
about a number of animals cobras in

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,000
delhi the government therefore

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,919
offered a bounty for every dead cobra

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,720
initially this was a successful

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,000
strategy as large numbers of snakes were

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,720
killed for their

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
for their reward really however

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,039
enterprising people began

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,679
to read cobras for their income

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,159
when the government became aware of this

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,280
their

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:09,360
reward program was shut down causing

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,960
the cobra breeders to set the worthless

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,200
snakes free

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,000
and the while cover population further

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,039
increase

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,320
i similarly copy paste that text from

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,880
wikipedia but

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,840
this story is what it is and it's our

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,000
story and it's

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:29,600
true the thing is if you put a price tag

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,360
on a problem you are encouraging

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:38,159
that problem to exist is a tricky

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:41,760
question and i advise i can exit

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:45,919
so what we need to do what we do

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:48,320
we solve both prices into things even if

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,200
they usually the user ends not paying

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,760
anything or

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,520
paying what they want and we should

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,720
showcase the effort we put

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:59,840
into apps i don't know maybe a

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:03,679
time spent in this app in

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:06,400
soft and software stores could do it

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,799
and i want to shout out to one company

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,919
who

00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:12,320
has been doing this successfully which

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:16,159
is elementary

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,280
elementary has this greeting page when

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,720
you want to download

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:23,440
their system it says pay what you want

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,000
you have three options and then a custom

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,799
option

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,840
where you can put even zero dollars if

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,240
you want

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,600
but this array makes a difference is

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,039
what i was saying

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:38,080
this is not a free operating system

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:41,440
you can donate to this is a pedophile

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:44,559
operating system you can buy for zero

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,720
zero dollars if you want

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,080
this already makes a difference they

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,480
told me between

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,440
one or two percent of people who

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,799
download it

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:58,000
donate which might seem a low number but

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,799
it's a very high com compared to the

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,799
amount of

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:06,400
which usually donates in other models

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:09,520
and it's interesting as well people use

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,159
put zero and download it for free but

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,400
then

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,080
you have people which patch one dollar

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,520
which is the minimum allow

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:20,240
quantity over other than zero to the low

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,919
it and then you have people with space

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,720
channels

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,159
by having a way by making it easy to pay

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,679
ten dollars by having

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,159
a direct button there people pay ten

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,279
dollars

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:37,679
instead of i don't know

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,679
we make things easy people follow

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:47,360
they know their touch it's not the usual

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:51,520
usual linux user is a user

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:54,720
they know bubbles they break them

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:58,240
and those are regular business practices

00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:01,600
which is another point if you want to

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:04,320
be like you have to

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,039
do business things like marketing or

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,240
like

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:10,000
reaching and doing investigations about

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,760
your target and the market

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:17,840
which is up developers usually don't do

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,840
in the open source aerial

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,919
pressing okay

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,760
now a platform a point of view proposal

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:41,600
this is what i want this is a markup

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,320
it's not anything planned but this is we

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,320
want

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,600
a norm to have in settings a payments

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,919
option

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,760
where you can put your bank data your

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,880
card that

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:59,360
and then you have a a simply

00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:02,159
a simple api to donate

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,919
apps don't have to to do anything just

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:07,279
implement the api

00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,840
you click the donate button you click

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,760
donate

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,400
and money goes from the user to the

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,400
developer

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,200
it needs to be something trustable this

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,320
is

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:23,600
why it needs to be an api and not some

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,279
apps implement them themselves we need

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,960
it to be a centralized

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:32,480
uh the desktop or the platform

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:35,039
is a big role and it needs

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,840
it needs to be frictionless you click

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,200
one button

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:42,400
you don't need to do anything more

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:46,880
you put your data your bank data once

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:50,799
you don't need to put it anymore

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:53,120
uh regarding the trustable thing

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,840
it needs to be an api we already do

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,400
something

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,320
like that for other things thanks to

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,799
flat pack and portals

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,600
apps don't know everything about the

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,799
system

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,480
they can't access access the camera or

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,400
the file system

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,720
we delegate on the system for that

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,760
through portals so we already lay the

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,360
wrong for

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:18,399
having this kind of interoperability

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,760
between apps and system and it's a

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:22,559
secure interpret

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,559
operativity

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,320
for users to put their bank data we also

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:31,200
need to offer incentives

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,159
and this is something interesting as

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,799
well

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,799
to platforms to have for funding

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,120
platforms though this is not a talk on

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:42,080
how to fund platforms

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,720
but there are lots of things platforms

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,000
could

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,760
offer like a configuration backups or

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,200
sync between devices or pass

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,399
notifications

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:56,720
things a service based on

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:59,360
uh on the cloud it might not be

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,320
backups but things that make the

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,440
applications

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,360
a little bit better

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,480
and this needs to be paid of course

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,679
everything a

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,880
clown needs to be paid

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:16,559
and that also is an incentive for users

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:19,520
to join the paid ecosystem

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,520
within the platform

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,360
so that will be all thank you for your

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:31,840
attention

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:31,840
attention and if you have any questions

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,960
hey they say do you think that the fact

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,640
that the

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:59,840
serial tag is not actively displayed

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,840
or yes alison

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,880
well yes do you think the fact that the

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,120
zero dollar

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,799
is not actively displayed on element

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,840
elementary or website

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,799
prevents them to reach a wider audience

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,039
i don't think so

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,399
in fact they share some data with me

00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,960
they have that

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,320
at the beginning they don't have any

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,320
more and

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:26,799
their and now they receive

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,279
10 times more money thanks to not having

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,279
data

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,000
what is your opinion on the addition of

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,159
sponsorship donation buttons on

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,240
github do you think this will help the

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:41,039
development of open source

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,760
of course this is similar to what i

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,799
propose

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,679
at the platform level but on github

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:49,120
the thing is that by having it on the

00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,360
repository

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,960
it does not reach a wider audience

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,320
usually people

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:59,440
don't reach to their repos for

00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,600
downloading software so

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,720
you are like might limiting your

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,720
audience to

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:09,840
developers when you have your

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,840
sponsorship only on

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,600
then you feel users will be wary of us

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,159
asking about

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,279
write their bank data that's what that's

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,399
why we need

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:24,720
to trust our regarding that

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:27,760
i mean we already we

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:31,360
are managing their their data and their

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:34,399
privacy so we want a solid foundation

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:37,120
this is a foundation's sole

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,480
manage which is tricky it's tricky to

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,799
manage a

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,760
payment data and to set up the

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,880
infrastructure

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,600
and the level infrastructure for the to

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,240
do that

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,840
but we that's why we have things like

00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,000
the

00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:55,120
non-foundation and they should

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,120
care care of that

00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,080
what do you think about having some kind

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,399
of open source up

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,919
monthly subscription something something

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:09,760
like spotify

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:12,799
for open source apps that is interesting

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:16,320
it'd be interesting to have some sort of

00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:19,360
cooperative or umbrella to sponsor

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:24,240
apps and app developers is

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,240
something something interesting to have

00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:29,039
or do you see all the communities in

00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:32,720
here collaborating

00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:35,519
things happen it will be wonderful

00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,679
we already have this summit uh which is

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:41,039
a collaboration between kda

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:44,080
kde inom and other players

00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:47,360
which is a very good first

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,799
step in we already collaborate in other

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,159
things

00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:54,720
like the portals i've talked

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,679
before so i could totally see that

00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:01,840
happen

00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:01,840
and it would be colorful

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,960
