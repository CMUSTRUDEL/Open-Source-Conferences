hello everyone my name is fabian

00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,080
nietmeyer

00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,000
i'm going to talk about human interface

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,360
guidelines and the roles they play in an

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,160
ecosystem

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,000
how they help with consistency and speed

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,800
up development

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,920
i've been working on kde human interface

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,119
guidelines for the last couple of years

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,480
my work is primarily focused and focused

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:29,039
on improving the structure presentation

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,000
and the existing content and not so much

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,680
in creating new

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,880
content creating new interface patterns

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,880
or ui elements

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,600
so just a shot what i'm going to talk

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,440
about

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,680
first what is a human interface

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,199
guideline then i'm going to show

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,840
a couple overview of some

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,960
existing human interface guidelines talk

00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,039
about the role of

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,239
human interface guidelines in an

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,719
ecosystem

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,320
and take a more detailed look into

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:13,840
aspects of

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:13,840
human interface guidelines

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,040
so what is the user interface it's a

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,720
space where interactions happen between

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,880
humans and machines

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,920
this is a very broad definition covers a

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,759
lot

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,200
a whole lot more than just computers and

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,840
mobile phones

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,159
but it also covers every kind of heavy

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,840
machinery operator controls or

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,479
industrial processes the user interface

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,439
typical

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,000
consists of some physical input device

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,240
for the human

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,280
to interact and one or more output

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,759
devices for the machine to interact

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,479
the most common input devices are

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,600
keyboards

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,960
mice gamepads remote controls touch

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,280
screens

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,200
and the most common output devices are

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,240
for visual feedback like monitors or

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,040
printers

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,600
or auditory feedback like speakers but

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,560
you can have

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,200
output devices for all other human

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,039
sensors as well

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,440
um one more well-known example would be

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,480
the

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,400
force feedback controller for

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,520
consoles like the xbox or the

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,120
playstation

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:25,760
where you have feedback from the machine

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,760
by when the controller vibrates

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,200
so human interface guidelines are a set

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,519
of rules

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,720
to guide interaction between humans and

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:37,840
for this talk at least

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,840
desktops and mobile phones

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,599
let's get on to some examples so

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,080
many different unit interface guidelines

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,080
on the web

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,160
um the most common ones or the most

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,599
well-known ones are those for the large

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,640
ecosystems for example

00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:02,640
google material design for android ios

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,360
flutter and the web i guess everyone has

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,360
seen it

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,760
in some way or the other or apple human

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,120
interface guidelines

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,959
actually apple provides not one

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,000
guideline but for

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,400
the way google has one big guideline

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,680
that covers everything apple provides a

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,040
set of guidelines

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,920
one for mac os one for ios one for watch

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,239
os

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,239
and one for um tv os

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,840
of course

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,319
of course microsoft has its own human

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,599
interface guidelines too

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,799
or rather several of them and they have

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,040
a

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,000
guideline for the universal windows

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,280
platform

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,280
they have one for windows 30

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,319
to 32 one for windows presentation

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,680
foundations

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,360
and one for windows forms and while

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,920
apple has four guidelines too

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,200
it's pretty straightforward which one to

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,640
choose

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,400
depending on the device you want to

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,640
develop for

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,400
but if you want to develop for microsoft

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,159
you need to choose human interface

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,959
guideline depending on the technology

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,000
you want

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,840
to develop this war you need to choose

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,680
the technology you want to develop

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,680
with by

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,320
if you want to

00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,479
[Music]

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,400
develop against one particular human

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,360
interface guideline

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,199
in my opinion it's pretty unfortunate to

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,000
have a different human interface

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,639
guidelines

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,280
for different technologies because it

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,840
makes it

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,840
so much harder to choose

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:53,280
so then of course there's a gnomes

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,280
human's interface guidelines

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,000
and kde human interface guidelines

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,880
actually when i started to work at kde

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,919
human interface guidelines we had a

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,039
similar problem

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,880
as microsoft has now or still has we had

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,000
two human interface guidelines you had

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,479
to choose between

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,759
depending on the technology you wanted

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,680
to develop this

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,280
on the one hand there was a classic huge

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,639
widget one

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,520
and on the other hand there was a qml in

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,560
kirigami one with a new set of controls

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,400
ui elements and navigational patterns

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,720
and to some extent we still have this

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,759
problem but as qml and kirigaming

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,560
achieved

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,840
things improved quite a bit and we are

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,000
back to only have one guideline for both

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,400
worlds

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,440
but all these human interface guidelines

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,000
i just

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,400
showed have in common they cover a very

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,919
very wide range a wide range of devices

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,400
a wide range of use cases for

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,400
applications

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,360
there are all kinds of applications in

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,120
each of these environments

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,880
but uh you know enterprise space

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:07,280
guidelines with a very different

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:08,960
very much narrow scope as well

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,600
for example there's a human interface

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,880
guideline for lg's web os

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,120
for the that are just narrative scopes

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,600
are just for tvs

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,520
so they only target one class of devices

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,160
and only a very reduced set of

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,960
applications

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,080
the applications you typically find on

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,479
the tv are

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,840
smaller and less complex than in the

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,440
other environments

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:38,639
we saw earlier in center round of the

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,639
consumer of media

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,199
but it's uh so but also something like

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,880
lead office has its own set of

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,720
guidelines so it's not only human

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,039
interface guidelines for platform

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,400
ecosystems or devices but there are

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,000
human error there's a

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,160
human interface guidelines for

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,240
applications for single applications as

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,240
well

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,520
like you can see here from the libra

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,520
office or

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:18,080
there's a human interface guideline

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,080
from blender

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,039
so after we saw some examples of

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,000
different human interface guidelines you

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,880
can find in

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,199
the web what else what role are they

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,280
actually playing in an ecosystem

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,560
let's see what some of the human

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:44,080
interface guidelines

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:47,039
themselves say about the role

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,199
this is from kde so the kde unit

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,199
interface guideline offers designers and

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,400
developers a set of recommendations for

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,960
producing

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,039
beautiful usable and consistent user

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,360
interfaces from convergent desktop and

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,240
mobile applications and

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,080
workspace widgets the aim is to improve

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,520
the experience for users by making

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,520
applications and which is

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,800
widget interfaces more consistent and

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:14,400
hence more intuitive and learnable

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,400
let's take a look at the second one

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,280
this is from google build beautiful

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,759
products faster

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,280
material is a design system that helps

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,479
teams build high quality

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,720
digital experiences we use our most

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,159
popular design and development resources

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,279
to jumpstart

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,279
your latest project

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:44,240
they have pretty much that they have

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,279
we have two core aspects mentioned in

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,360
this

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:52,880
human interface in these descriptions

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:57,440
one consistency and the other one

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:59,680
is speed up design and development

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,279
consistency is about creating a sense of

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,519
control from

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:08,240
familiarity and reliability for the user

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,880
consistency increases usability

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,959
something

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,080
a user learned once can be applied over

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,640
and over again in the same ecosystem

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,399
the other major point is human interface

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,680
guidelines try to speed up design and

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,720
development

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,480
for example by providing design examples

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,920
or giving standard

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,920
solutions for common problems

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,880
so how do human interface guidelines

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,200
have in achieving these goals let's take

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,560
a look at two core parts of typical user

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,800
interface guidelines

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,600
navigation patterns patterns and

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,680
components

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,839
and how they help to achieve consistency

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,839
and speed up development

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,240
navigation patterns navigation pad does

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,760
something very fundamental for every app

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,360
navigation patterns are

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,200
the way a user is supposed to move

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,200
through an application

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,040
so there are different ways a user could

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,680
move through an application

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,160
you can move your graphic up and down in

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,560
an application

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,600
you can move lateral between the same

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,560
level of

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,560
in the application

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,800
you can reverse either in history

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,920
or hierarchy like

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:43,040
going back in the browser or

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,360
in the mobile applications or you can

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,000
have

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,000
jumps like most hyperlinks and websites

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,440
are where you just jump from one

00:10:48,000 --> 00:11:01,839
point to the other without very just

00:10:51,440 --> 00:11:01,839
jump directly

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,600
there are lots and lots of navigation

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:09,200
patterns to achieve

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,959
this hamburger menus tabs vertical

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,200
navigation breadcrumbs

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,600
menus bottom bars expandable lists

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,399
wizards collapsible content dialogues

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,920
carousels

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,839
column-based navigation and so on

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,920
typically you want only a subset of

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,519
these patterns in your ecosystem

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,920
to choose the right one or the right

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,839
ones because most of the time one needs

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,560
to combine multiple of these is very

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,200
fundamental to an app

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,399
the whole key role of a human interface

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,079
guideline is help

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,440
for the designers and developers to

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,800
choose the right pattern for an

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,880
ecosystem

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,839
because not all patterns will fit into

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,839
your ecosystem

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:53,040
some patterns just fell out of time like

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,079
this collapsible sidebar panels

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:59,920
in mozilla's pre firefox web browser

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:01,519
so you would click on here and then the

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,279
content would expand and the other

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,519
content would collapse

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,720
i don't think this pattern is used

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,040
anywhere

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,519
anywhere anymore at least not in a

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,079
sidebar today we would probably use some

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,560
kind of

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,000
props on the top to switch between the

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:25,839
contents

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:25,839
or a vertical sidebar

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,440
some patterns work only for some screen

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,560
sizes

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:37,440
like this vertical sidebar

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,000
it works great on a tv on a mobile phone

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,360
not so much

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,360
because you don't have the space

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,760
or they only work for some kind for some

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,880
input methods like touch is not as

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,720
accurate as mouse

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:53,839
so the internet interface and the

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,839
patterns need to adjust it

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,800
and some patterns might just not fit the

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,560
vision you have for your platform

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,639
for example here is a different concept

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,680
for the secondary navigation in ios and

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,680
material design

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:15,200
apple is using a more tab in the bottom

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,399
bar to access navigation destinations

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,440
that don't fit

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,839
in the bottom bar so if you want to go

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,880
somewhere here it doesn't fit in here so

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,480
you have to

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,560
push the more button and then you have

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:31,040
attacked with more

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,040
repair more navigation destinations

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,680
on the other hand material design would

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,519
use a sidebar

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,880
to access the additional navigation

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,880
points in here

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,320
they are both probably equally viable

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,800
but if you want to

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,639
have your app to be consistent in ios

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,560
you need to choose the more tab and if

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,920
you want to develop for material design

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:57,519
you should choose the sidebar

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,880
and that's something a developer or

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,600
designer

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,360
cannot choose from there himself you

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,680
have to give him

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,680
hints

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:19,440
so let's talk about components

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,720
yeah another basic uh element of human

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,320
interface guidelines

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,519
components are smaller building blocks

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,000
of uis buttons check boxes radio buttons

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:31,839
tabs

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,839
cards lists and so on

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,279
some general advice for human intel

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,560
if you create human interface guidelines

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,040
for these components

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,360
give as much detail as possible details

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:49,279
help to speed up design and development

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,279
and details improve consistency

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,560
you can see the difference in how much

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,000
more detail google puts in its material

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,399
design document

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,160
documentations and apple doesn't i have

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,360
documentation

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:11,199
you have a width you have a

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:14,240
height if you have detailed settings

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:17,680
on ios it's just

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,800
an image so when google released

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,680
material design in

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,720
2014 they were one of the first or the

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:28,160
first to add so much details

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,480
specs to their guidelines and

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,079
it was so much easier to reproduce these

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,360
components for something new a new

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,040
programming language or new framework

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,399
and it's so much easier when you look

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,519
around for

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,680
for example for web development web

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,839
development frameworks

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,000
every other web development framework

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,800
looks like material design

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,839
because it's so easy to recreate

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:57,440
material design

00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:59,839
components in another technology

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,440
i searched around a bit to find one that

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:09,839
follows apple's human interface

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:09,839
guidelines and i think i found only one

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,800
but details it's not only about

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,279
expanding your ecosystem into new

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,199
technologies or new toolkits

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,800
but it also helps with the creation of

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,199
new controls

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,120
sooner or later some designer developer

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,079
will have the need for new custom

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,920
control

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:36,079
to solve a problem that won't be covered

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:39,759
by your human interface guidelines

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:42,560
so just to showcase how this

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,519
should could work let's say i created

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,519
this very basic

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,120
maybe not overly useful and important

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,639
component for my all-new

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,000
material design app doesn't look like a

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,000
material design component

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,880
at all and in fact it doesn't look very

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,639
usable or pretty at the moment either

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,560
but we can easily improve it by just

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,839
applying the detailed specs

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,400
we find in the material design

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,319
documentation

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,319
first let's add the padding within the

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,319
button in the specification earlier

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,919
now we have applied the padding here and

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,120
here and here

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:20,480
and here and here now

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,480
it looks a lot better already

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,000
in the next step let's apply the border

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,760
radius typical from

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,839
material components and add some drop

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,840
shadow everything

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:33,840
can be found in material design

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,840
guidelines

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:40,400
even better but

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,679
still not quite there so let's take a

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,600
look around material design

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,440
documentation for a similar control we

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,840
could use to get more specifications

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,840
from

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:55,679
this is like the small card

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,240
so we let's take the width and the

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,480
height from this card

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,320
and apply it together with the height we

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:14,880
saw earlier on the button

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:16,559
on our new control

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,919
now it actually does look like some

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,919
material design control

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,840
i'm too fast

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,400
it blends in nicely with other material

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,400
design components

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,200
because we use the same this as a

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,080
standard card we can easily use both of

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,000
them together

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,400
so we could for example use them in the

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,640
same container on the same page

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,640
store them together it would work very

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,400
nicely

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,400
if i want to add an image like it's

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,440
shown here in the in the card

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,080
we could just put it in here

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,440
use the same paddings and specify it

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:11,360
over here

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:13,280
and improve my component even more

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,440
and in the process only by applying all

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,200
these specifications i found in the

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,720
documentation in the human interface

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,640
guideline

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,240
my component got much prettier and more

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,480
usable as well

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,520
so especially applying the paddings

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,559
makes it much better

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,880
of course i could do all this too if the

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,200
documentation doesn't provide it i could

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,960
take a screenshot

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,799
open my drawing application and start

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,039
measuring everything

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,039
it would take me hours and hours and

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:49,200
i would have to make a lot of guesses is

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,640
it more important that the

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,640
button has the risk of 60 pixels or is

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,360
it more important that the padding is 16

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,400
pixels

00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:01,440
or what happens if i

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,159
um if the title gets too long is it

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,200
going do i have to light it or is it

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,960
just cut off

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:11,760
is my button growing um i have to make a

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,760
lot of guesses

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,880
what are the important values what what

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,480
did the designers or

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,840
says the writers of the human interface

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,840
guidelines aim for

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,480
that you can take all these

00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,320
specifications

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,679
directly from the material design

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,280
guidelines makes it so much

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,799
faster and easier to design

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,799
and it helps you not to forget some

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:43,760
things like a padding

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,760
or size or whatever

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:52,720
it's the same with um

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:56,240
is it typing so i could uh with the type

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:59,440
no if i want to have a

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,799
title in my control i could just

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:07,440
copy the font files from

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,440
the card that's something that the

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,679
we are in the kde human interface

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,080
guidelines are missing a lot

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,200
we don't have a lot of details in our

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,520
stuff so

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,240
it's hard to recreate them or to create

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,240
them again

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,159
and we actually did recreate a lot

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,039
because we had to create uh

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,120
components in qml that already existed

00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:31,840
in

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,840
huge widgets

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,280
okay i'm just i'm sorry i'm talking so

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:59,840
fast that i'm pretty much

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:59,840
through my presentation already

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:10,080
instead just sum it up and

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,039
human interface guideline gives more

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,200
consistencies for an ecosystem

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,080
in design they give more consistency in

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,840
the inter

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,520
actions and to speed up design and

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,400
development for example by giving

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,159
standards

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,720
standardized solutions for common

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,720
problems

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,720
luckily i see there are a lot of

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,120
questions already in the

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,120
notes

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,000
today all desktops have their own human

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,240
interface guidelines as they should

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,080
but for developer developers coming into

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,080
the app ecosystem would it be possible

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,200
to have a minimum set of human interface

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,760
guidelines for the app

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,760
ecosystem without having to choose one

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:57,760
i think i don't quite understand the

00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,760
question

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,039
so you choose the ecosystem you want to

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,320
develop for

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:12,080
it typically comes along with a new

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,580
interface guideline

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:18,690
so i don't know what you don't want to

00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,690
[Music]

00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,840
choose

00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:37,840
[Music]

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,840
um

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,080
hello uh would you like me to read the

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,840
questions for you

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,480
are you okay i i can i can read them too

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,240
but yeah

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:54,240
i'm fine with you reading them okay

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,960
stay again you're welcome to read them

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,559
okay have you um so um would you like me

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,039
to take from the first question or you

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,039
want me to

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,159
sorry i'm going to be taking the first

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,840
question

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,840
have you attempted any of the questions

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:19,840
okay um can you hear me i think my can

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,840
you hear me

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:30,880
hello can you hear me yes i can hear you

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:34,080
okay chris uh um

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:37,279
sorry i'm having some issues with my mic

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,279
um one minute

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,159
okay so the second question um do you

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,720
think designers

00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,080
from the various desktop projects will

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,520
be able to collectively

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:54,080
exchange ideas in a space um

00:24:51,520 --> 00:25:00,640
like a glass or specific forum for

00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:03,919
designers on the linux platform

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,080
and yes i think so good but um at least

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,080
for

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,360
um there are not so many designers

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,600
because our

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,520
approach to human interface guidelines

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,200
is not directed from the

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,960
top to rather but there's not a

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,720
group that creates a human interface

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,799
guidelines and every one

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:32,720
has to follow it but it's more a process

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:38,720
of documenting the actual development

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:40,960
um and designers i talked mostly in the

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,039
presentation are designers for

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,480
applications not for the

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,230
not to write a human interface

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,240
guidelines because

00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:51,279
[Music]

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,320
most designers are not you are no

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,360
user interface or user or user

00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:00,960
experience

00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,960
experts either but of course

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,600
there could be a lot more collaboration

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:10,960
between the desktops

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:14,159
and a lot of exchange of ideas

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,400
and i think uh something like um

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,279
conference would work best especially

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,080
for design

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:25,840
is uh in my opinion very important to

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,840
have a personal face-to-face

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,200
okay um thank you so much um there's a

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,679
third question

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,279
say them are there any lego restrictions

00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:39,440
with regard to

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:41,840
using material design outside android

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,919
not as far as i know but i'm not a legal

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,120
expert

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,760
okay there's very many other projects

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:53,840
that use

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,840
material design

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,559
um okay so we still have more questions

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,679
coming up for you but then i'll

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,880
go to the fourth question how do you

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,279
suggest we approach

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,720
conversation between desktop and mobile

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,640
and

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,120
applications that are developed to work

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,120
on both

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,919
um like i said in the beginning of my

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,600
program

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:25,440
much more in

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:28,799
writing and rupturing the content and

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,279
providing images

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,880
and videos and stuff like this and

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,799
actually creating a

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,480
user interface patterns or design

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:40,000
patterns so

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:43,760
i think you have to ask someone else

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:47,279
who's more expert in this area than me

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:50,559
okay um can i like the fifth question

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:53,600
this is um are there um h i g s

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:57,679
uh for vr slash aar

00:27:53,600 --> 00:28:03,039
um yes okay for example microsoft uh

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:07,360
universal universal platform uvp

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,360
university windows platform covers

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:16,799
also vr at least they try to

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:19,919
that's what they say in their in the ear

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:23,760
it's um in their

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:26,799
uh documentation

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,720
uh um okay um

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,320
so we have someone trying to quickly

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,720
wrap uh get a

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,080
question um so it says and those

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,360
microsoft hig

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:41,679
cover vr slash error for

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:44,720
ulu lens and then or other devices too

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:48,320
i don't know

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,039
i guess other human interface guidelines

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,480
for

00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:55,679
other vr stuff like

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:58,720
from steam

00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,559
or i don't know but there are

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,320
tons of human interface guidelines out

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,320
