all right

00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:10,240
so i guess we'll get right into it

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:16,240
this talk is about gaming achievements

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:19,920
for all

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,920
uh let's see

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,039
how do i go to the next slide

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,760
okay so

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,559
when games first came to arcades

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,440
you have the high score so people would

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,640
compete to try to get the high score

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:47,200
as they moved into the

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,879
home with consoles and with computers

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,879
you would end up with games that

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,160
actually have a

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,559
winning condition so you could go over

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,760
and save the princess

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,800
now over time people would go over and

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,760
make up their own

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,519
tasks to make the game harder or to just

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,640
try something different

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,320
so for example here we have a screenshot

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,880
from legend of zelda

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,600
with someone playing it without ever

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,720
picking up

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,320
the wooden sword so instead you have to

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,720
go over and

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,119
get other items to attack at the

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,119
beginning

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,600
then there are other games that they

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,000
would go over and they would

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,840
give you a rating for how you did at

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,520
completing a level for example

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,759
if you completed it within a certain

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,759
time you would get the max rating

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,799
if you took longer then you would get a

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,759
lower uh

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,960
star rating so people would end up you

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,240
know trying to

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:50,240
replay the level to get that

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:53,600
additional achievement and so

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,399
uh super talk for example

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,840
uh includes how many secrets you've

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,479
found in the levels and

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,920
in statistics like that how many coins

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,479
you've collected

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,119
so you can go back and try to get

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,799
everything

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,080
and complete all the different

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,080
achievements for the level

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:20,000
now the xbox

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,720
is where that really changed

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,640
all of these were stored only on your

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,280
local machine

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,080
you you could bring people over and show

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,720
them

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,040
how you're doing in your game but that

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,080
that was the extent of the social aspect

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,519
of it

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,280
with the xbox they added in

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,560
the ability to have your achievements

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,879
online

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,640
so you could go over and see what games

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,840
your friends have been playing how far

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,840
they've gotten in the game

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,760
over time all the other play

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,360
platforms have pretty much adopted

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,879
achievements

00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:02,319
so you playstation has uh

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,319
achievements steam has achievements and

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,879
along with gog

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,120
epic recently added in achievements as

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,120
well

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:19,840
but free and open source software

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,840
doesn't have this

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,400
now there are some simple reasons behind

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,799
this for one thing

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,400
we have no central server behind the

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,319
platform so

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:37,280
sony runs the achievements for

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,640
the playstation because they own that

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,440
platform

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,840
there is no one that owns the platform

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,040
for

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,680
uh open source software uh

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,560
we're not going to get red hat running

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,760
their own

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,760
achievement servers

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,760
there's also no registering of games so

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,040
if you decide to make a game for free

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:04,799
software the game's released

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,799
people can play it or not

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,720
as an additional concern

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,600
free software and open source uh

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:20,959
users tend to be

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,680
more privacy oriented and so they don't

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:28,320
necessarily want to go over and give

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:32,960
all their information to a central uh

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,880
company now

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,000
i i'm not certain that there's anything

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,240
that

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,560
those companies can necessarily use with

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,960
that data to

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,560
really do much but there is that privacy

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,400
concern and

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,280
there's no reason that they need to have

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,280
that information

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,600
now we've had this problem with social

00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,800
networks

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,160
and we solved this with what's

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,360
collectively called the fetiverse so we

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,880
have a whole bunch

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:12,160
of different social networking sites

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,520
and all of them collaborate with

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:19,440
different protocols so while

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,240
i'm using a hubzilla social networking

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,720
site

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,720
one of my friends can use mastodon and

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,720
we can trade messages perfectly fine

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,199
now what happened was free game dev

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,400
site went over and set up a hubzilla

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,639
server

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,240
and i had been thinking about this

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,199
problem with

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,840
uh game achievements for a while and so

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,840
i kept

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,199
suggesting to different people you know

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,919
the idea of

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,800
setting up some sort of federated system

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:56,319
for that

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,120
and so with hubzilla it has the ability

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,960
to

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,680
have plug-ins so you could go over and

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,960
create

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,479
new features and so after

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,120
uh libra planet 2020 i decided you know

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,000
what

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,319
i'm gonna go over and try to tackle this

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,319
problem

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:21,840
and i should say that although this

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,280
my one of my concerns is open source and

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,560
free software

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,080
this isn't a problem only for free and

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,400
open source software

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,880
uh the problem also affects commercial

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,319
developers in that

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,560
now you have to go over and you have to

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,120
make a separate build for steam

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,680
a separate build for gog a separate

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,880
build for

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,120
epic and so you you have to maintain all

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,319
these different versions

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,240
and so if you had one version that

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,599
supported achievements across

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:57,120
all of those systems

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,120
it would simplify things

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:08,720
so this is a screenshot uh

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,720
from the gamerzilla

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:15,520
so you could see this is uh one

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,120
part is the list of games and

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,800
what achieve how many achievements

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,319
you've earned and the total number of

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,440
achievements

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,520
and then you've got one where you've uh

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,360
clicked into a particular game and can

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,400
see the achievements you've gotten for

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,160
that game

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:35,280
and the progress you've been making now

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:39,360
i'm not big on

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:45,840
development on front ends so

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,840
they're very minimalistic here

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,759
so how does gamerzilla work

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,080
so the the way it's

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,360
envisioned to work is that you have

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,039
hubzilla

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,840
running the gamerzilla plugin or

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,759
we could a separate server could be

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,039
developed

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,520
and then you would have that

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,080
communicating with a game launcher

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,000
something like the steam client so in

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,720
this case it could be

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,840
game hub it could be lutress

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:27,120
and those game launchers would use the

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:30,639
lib gamerzilla library

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:34,719
to perform that syncing with uh

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,279
hubzilla and to listen for games that

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,800
are

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,080
updating their status the games

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,360
themselves would also

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,800
use live gamerzilla it would go over and

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,959
connect to the game

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:51,120
launcher and whenever you achieved a

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,200
you got an achievement it would send the

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,120
information over

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,720
all of this information is cached and

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,279
will automatically resync

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,160
so if you play the game offline for a

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,080
while

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,279
then load up the launcher it will

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,800
automatically

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,560
send all the data over and if you decide

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,959
you know what i don't want

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:16,160
a hubzilla site with my achievements

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,399
loaded online that's fine you could

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:23,839
still look at the achievements in the

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,839
game launcher if you wanted

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:32,399
so what's the current state right now um

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:35,839
currently super tux cart uh has

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,560
merged support uh super tax card is

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,240
written in c

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,640
plus plus uh there's a game small track

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,160
that i added in support to

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:50,000
the developer doesn't seem interested in

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:53,120
merging that uh that one is written in

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,320
nim uh there is sea

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,560
horse adventures that i forked

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,760
so that i could update it to python 3

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,760
and add in support

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,600
there is shipping 1984

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,959
which again was one of these

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,320
unmaintained projects

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:16,240
that i added support to

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:20,160
i recently made a pinball discrim game

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:23,279
for the discrim game jam

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,480
it was written in godot and so i added

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,000
in support to

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:31,120
use gamerzilla from godot

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,680
and me and my shadow is another game

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:38,320
that i've added in support to

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:42,000
so far they haven't merged that either

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,440
and finally for launchers i've added

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,920
i've coded up support in gamehub

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,680
that's written in vala and it hasn't

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,399
been merged yet

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,560
the developer is working on doing some

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,600
refactoring and doesn't want to merge it

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,600
until that is done

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:06,480
uh they the free game dev

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:10,000
has offered to enable the uh

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,200
gamerzilla plugin for hubzilla and that

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,200
has been done

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,320
but it's currently not working for some

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,680
reason

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,000
so i i'm still trying to track that down

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,480
yet

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,480
so far

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,360
the reason i listed the languages here

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,519
was to show

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,640
that it is capable of being used

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,600
anywhere

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,519
i've it was written in c specifically so

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:38,240
that it would be easy to

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,240
use on other systems or other languages

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,279
if you want to get in touch with me here

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,079
