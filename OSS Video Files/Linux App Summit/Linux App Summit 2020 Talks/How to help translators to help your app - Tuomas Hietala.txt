Description: 
	High quality localisation is essential to great user experience for most people in the world, yet the process of translating applications in the Linux / FOSS ecosystem is often more difficult than it needs to be. The problems faced by translators may not be obvious to software developers, though. In this talk I try to give advice to developers and communities who would like to have their applications translated better, based on my experiences in translating various FOSS software.

Key points:
Give credit
Offer modern infrastructure
Be responsive
Enable communities
Verify, but trust
Provide context
Avoid hard-coded assumptions
Don't reinvent the wheel
Encourage fixing issues at the source
Consider sustainability
