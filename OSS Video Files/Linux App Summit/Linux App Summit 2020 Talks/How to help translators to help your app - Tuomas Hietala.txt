Title: How to help translators to help your app - Tuomas Hietala
Publication date: 2020-11-15
Playlist: Linux App Summit 2020 Talks
Description: 
	High quality localisation is essential to great user experience for most people in the world, yet the process of translating applications in the Linux / FOSS ecosystem is often more difficult than it needs to be. The problems faced by translators may not be obvious to software developers, though. In this talk I try to give advice to developers and communities who would like to have their applications translated better, based on my experiences in translating various FOSS software.

Key points:
Give credit
Offer modern infrastructure
Be responsive
Enable communities
Verify, but trust
Provide context
Avoid hard-coded assumptions
Don't reinvent the wheel
Encourage fixing issues at the source
Consider sustainability

okay so hello everyone and

00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,599
welcome to my presentation how to help

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,639
translators to help your app

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:17,920
um my name is thomas

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,920
and uh let's see

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,960
sorry i have trouble

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:30,640
chasing slides okay here it goes

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,360
so uh a few words about myself

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,480
i've done translating free and open

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,800
source software for

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:42,079
a few years now maybe i don't know since

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,680
2017 or something so not that long

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:50,719
but i've done quite a lot a lot of

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,719
translations for various apps

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,039
mostly in libreoffice but also many

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,800
others

00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,120
and i recently became a member of the

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,039
document foundation uh which are the

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,240
makers of libreoffice

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,799
but uh for

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,520
clarity i should say that i'm speaking

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,920
only for myself here and

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,119
not on behalf of any organizations so

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,119
these are my personal views

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,840
and some motivation

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,320
why is it important to have good

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,240
translations

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,000
well if you have if you're creating

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,880
software for end users you probably

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,040
would want to have it

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,920
translated and

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,600
a well translated app is understandable

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,040
of course

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,840
but it also makes a good impression

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,799
and conversely a poorly translated app

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,360
will make a

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,360
bad impression usually

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,799
if you have your trap app translated to

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,520
local language

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,960
it may be deployed in the public sector

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,200
or other

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,200
large deployments large corporations

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,479
if your app is not translated it

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,560
may not be eligible for that kind of

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:16,480
deployments

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:20,560
and of course when you

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,200
if the if your app is well translated

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,800
people can recommend it to their friends

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,800
and family with our reservations

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:34,840
so what can you do to make this happen

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:37,360
if you're a developer or a community

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,760
coordinator

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,760
um

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,680
so first thing is to give credit to

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,440
translators you would think this is kind

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,519
of obvious but

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,959
in many cases it's really not

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,560
unfortunately

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,319
or in it's better to say in some cases

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,800
mostly these

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:05,840
projects get this right but

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,840
unfortunately not always

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:13,120
attribution is kind of a cornerstone for

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,959
free and opens up software if you're

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,840
donating your time to some project

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,120
at least you get credit if you don't get

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,800
money

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,200
and with code it's

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,640
almost universal it works like this but

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,519
with translations

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,519
not always

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,959
so what is a good attribution

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,080
well a name in the credits it's fine

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,560
it's good but

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,680
it's better if i have some something

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,080
more specific

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:53,760
which i can point to um

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,640
for example in in if you're a programmer

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,319
you have a github or gitlab profile

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,239
probably

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,680
which you can point to you can put a

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,680
link in your cv or something

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:11,200
so this is good also for translators

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,239
let's say if i want to apply for grants

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,640
or jobs

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,959
it's good to have something which i can

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,959
point to that i made this

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,400
these are my translations you can have a

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,880
look at

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,880
how good i am at translating

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,240
uh there's also legal angle

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,479
although i must make a disclaimer here

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,800
that i'm not a lawyer

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:40,160
but if you don't know who

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,520
uh who made the translations to your app

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,479
you don't know who holds the copyrights

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,120
uh so i think it's also legally

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:52,000
important

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:54,639
or or from a licensing perspective that

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,440
you know who your translators are and

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,479
and can

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,479
attribute them properly

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,960
so next one

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,759
offer modern infrastructure

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,520
so there's um when it comes to code

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,440
there's a kind of

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,000
general trend in and free and open

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,120
source developments

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,080
uh the trend is moving from patches and

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,759
mailing lists and

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:31,919
bugzillas and so on to integrated

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:35,520
platforms like github and gitlab

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:38,080
so the question is why shouldn't

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,120
translators also have this kind of

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,120
integrated platforms

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:51,039
and luckily there are options

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,039
for that i think the current

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,840
contenders are web blades

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,840
which is used by

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,720
fedora libreoffice operations maetus

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:09,919
uh another actively developed

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,960
platform is pontoon which is used and

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,080
developed

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:18,960
by mozilla and

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,960
there used to be a couple of more open

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,000
source solutions portal and zanata but

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,680
they are not being

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,680
actively developed right now

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,680
and then there are a couple of

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,960
proprietary alternatives also

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:37,280
kraven and transfx which many

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,280
free and open source projects also use

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,240
the benefits of this kind of integrated

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,120
platform are

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:49,199
easy to user interface sso support

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,280
integrated glossaries commands user

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,280
profiles

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,880
although here i must say that transfix

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,120
doesn't have a very useful

00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:02,160
user profiles which is a kind of a

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,479
negative if you

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,599
would like to apply for grants or jobs

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,599
or something you can't

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,039
really prove what you did with the

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,560
transfix

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,360
user profile so i wouldn't recommend

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,919
that for

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,919
that reason

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,199
there are some objections which i've

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,720
heard in in some discussions

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,800
around these kind of platforms

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,560
the first one is it's it's too easy

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,160
anyone can do anything and and the

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,400
quality will suffer

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,400
and there's some truth to this uh

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,639
objection i think

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,479
it can be a problem that uh some people

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,080
do very low efforts

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,080
kind of drive by translations

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,919
but i think

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,360
kind of software development skills kind

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,560
of command line wizardry is not

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,759
necessarily a good

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,520
proxy for translation skills

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,680
so you want to say some kind of quality

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,199
bar but

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,199
setting it by requiring

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,440
software development knowledge is not

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,879
necessarily a

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:20,800
good solutions you can put some

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,800
some access control there of course and

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,440
try to get the quality quality control

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,960
in other ways

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,440
and i'll return to this point later

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,320
the second objection is that these are

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:38,240
slower than native code

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:42,000
and yes can be but at least weblade

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,959
gives the option to use offline tools

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,880
also so you can

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,800
download the translations from webplate

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,279
and then

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,000
use any tool what you like and then

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:55,680
upload

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:59,279
it back again

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,279
number three be responsive

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:08,160
sometimes translators can have questions

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,440
which the developers can answer better

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,920
because they know the code they have

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,920
written it

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,760
so if the translators have questions

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:21,200
please try to answer them as a developer

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,399
because it can save a lot of time

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,720
uh it's good to have some kind of

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,920
mailing list of forum for general

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,279
discussion

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,600
and if you're using web later or

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,000
something the comments there are good

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,360
for discussing specific

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,959
trash license or strings

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:42,399
if of course the developers will respond

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,839
um and i think it's better to take the

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,480
attitude that you don't

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,640
outsource the translations to some

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,720
nebulous community

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,720
you invite translators to your project

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,279
and i think sometimes the community can

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,920
be kind of

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,200
nebulous because it doesn't really exist

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,560
as a community

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,600
properly sometimes

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,320
it can be that there are just random

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,640
people

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,839
who never really communicate with each

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,399
other

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,480
um so if you want to know what

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,839
it's like you can imagine wikipedia

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,519
without the talk page

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,440
so if there are some

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,560
differences between editors the only way

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,120
to settle it is the

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,000
kind of edit war and this is not really

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,560
what you want

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,560
you want people to communicate

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,279
so please encourage the formation of

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,120
language communities and give them the

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:50,880
effort infrastructure that they need

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,880
and you have to

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,120
be aware that if you have a very small

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,640
project it's

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,440
it might be better to cooperate with

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,600
some other projects

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,480
because a very small project may not be

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,279
able to

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,279
attract a very

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:12,240
large language community

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,240
if at all

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,160
if even bigger porsches can have

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,959
problems

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,959
with small languages at least with this

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:33,120
that is a question of trust

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,440
and in general i think use it verify but

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,440
trust

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,079
so how can you trust that random people

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,440
on the internet will translate your app

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,120
correctly

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,600
to language you don't necessarily speak

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,600
yourself

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,959
yes maybe you shouldn't always trust

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,959
them too

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,480
if you're running a business and and

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,800
your business depends on people having a

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,079
good

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,720
first impression on your app or website

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,760
then maybe just hire a professional

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,360
translator and not

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,600
trust that random people on the internet

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,600
will

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,600
make such a good translation that it

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,160
will make a good impression

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,160
on people

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:21,360
or maybe i don't know if you have some

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,440
uh security related app which is

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,200
supposed to

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:30,800
protect uh journalists or something or

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,399
then it could be a problem if no one

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,079
reviews the translation

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:38,639
it's just random people

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,959
translating the stuff with varying

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:44,880
quality

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:47,920
um but

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,480
still if you want to uh kind of open it

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,560
for everyone then

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,079
at least if you credit your translations

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,279
pro translators

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:59,360
properly they have kind of a skin in the

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:03,360
game

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:07,839
their reputation depends on its

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,839
if they care about that and

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,440
if you have a proper community then

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,839
that's probably more trustworthy than

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,160
than just random people doing random

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,160
things

00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:25,200
um there's something you can

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,200
verify sort of too

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,279
tools like web blades have automated

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,079
checks

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,560
which are useful to catch some mistakes

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:38,720
at least

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:41,120
but i think i must emphasize that

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,839
someone someone who actually understands

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:47,440
language must have the final word

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:50,560
you shouldn't let automatic

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,240
checks to override people but

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,240
use them to help people

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:09,279
uh next is provide context

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,839
so the problem for

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,720
translating ui strings in most software

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,040
is that

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,440
the strings are often really short and

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:21,760
ambiguous

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:24,560
there are words like link group at least

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,440
they can be either words so now it

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,440
announced words

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,160
so unless you have some kind of context

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,680
you don't know how to translate them

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,680
correctly also words like

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,839
advanced or connected can refer to one

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,079
or many things or

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,519
even something like page style then can

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,720
that can

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:49,440
refer to one page or all pages

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,079
again you have to know the context what

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,720
it really

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,720
refers to

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,160
so tracking down the right context can

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,360
be

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,040
quite difficult and time consuming so

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:07,519
it's really good if

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:12,160
developers can help translators by

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:15,760
providing some kind of context strings

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:19,440
so if there's some tag like tooltip or

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,040
menu item that's good and it's even

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,000
better if you have longer explanations

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,279
for more

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,279
difficult strings

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,639
even a little bit helps up

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:44,800
next one you should avoid

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:49,120
hard-coding your assumptions into the

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:52,560
strings so

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,560
for example english grammar

00:15:53,120 --> 00:16:00,959
if you uh rely on the english

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:04,880
sentence structure that may not be

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,880
applicable to every language

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,839
so um instead of

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,639
using very inflexible structure where

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,759
you have to put

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,639
a certain word in certain place users

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,440
rather

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,720
try to use variables which the

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,240
translator can then

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,240
rearrange as they see fit

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:36,560
but even with variables you might

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,199
or translators of summer languages might

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,320
still encounter problems or kind of

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,240
have to work around a bit because for

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,560
example finnish uses lots of

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,560
inflections so

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,560
even the variables are not really ideal

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,279
and you kind of have to

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,680
work around them a bit sometimes but

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,759
then

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,600
there's not really an easy solutions

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:04,400
here

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:06,720
for that kind of languages um

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,640
although there's a project fluent by

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,280
mozilla which seems quite promising

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,600
which

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,520
allows more effective flexibility for

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,919
translators

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,839
i haven't tried it myself but it could

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,839
be a solution here

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:27,600
with regard to plural forms

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,480
you can use get text to get the right

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,559
amount of

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,640
plural forms

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:38,880
because they are not always like one or

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,880
many as they are in english they can be

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,400
more more of them in in various

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,559
languages

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,679
and of course day 10 time formats very

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:52,000
calendars vary

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:55,600
collision rooms very writing direction

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,600
average length of words

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,520
sometimes there's a problem with um

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,679
uh strings where the developers who

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,480
speak english have

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,679
it only left only very little space for

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,520
the strings

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,880
but in some languages the words might be

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:15,840
longer and needs more

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,840
need more space

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,720
okay here's some good news for chance uh

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,520
you don't have to reinvent the wheel or

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,400
should not

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,679
because a lot of hard localization work

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,679
has been done for you already

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:40,840
use it to make use of these tools that

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:46,559
someone has already made for you like

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:49,039
cldr the common local data repository

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,000
for for example dates times names of

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,880
languages

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,880
names of countries

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,480
you you should use get text or something

00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,480
like that

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,799
if you need some kind of localized

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,919
citations you could use the

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:08,960
citation style language

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:11,840
this is a lib number text for numbers

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,840
and currencies

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,480
yes use them please

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,000
something you also should consider doing

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,000
is

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,480
encouraging fixing issues at the source

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,799
uh because your ui strings and

00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:39,120
documentation

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,799
might not be written by technical

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,600
writers who are very

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,880
fluent in english or ux experts they

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,000
might be just written by

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,720
programmers who may not speak english as

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,799
their first

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:56,160
first language uh or fluently at

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:58,480
all and and it's certainly not their

00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,480
fault

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,919
they should be doing what they're good

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,919
at which is programming

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:11,360
but as translators

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:13,760
we can help because translators are

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:19,120
people who reach through the

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:22,799
strings a lot and try to understand them

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:27,440
so uh if there are some

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:30,640
strangeness in the strings then um

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:34,320
trash riders can can

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:37,840
notice that and and report issues

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,280
often at least so

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,200
please try to make it easy for the

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:46,159
translators to report or fix the issues

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,159
in the source strings

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,000
this way uh you could save work for

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:56,559
everyone

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:59,840
on and and help fix the issues

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:03,840
once and for all instead of having every

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,840
translator to work around them

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:19,440
and finally consider sustainability

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,600
um well as some of you might remember

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,679
around the turn of the millennium there

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,919
was a

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,520
kind of hype around free and open source

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,120
software that

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,799
if you just throw your code on the

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,520
internet then

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,400
thousands of volunteers with springfort

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,760
and and

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:41,120
tirelessly improve it for you

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,320
well i in around 20 years later we have

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,720
found out that

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,120
no maybe that's not always what's going

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,120
to happen

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,400
and that's not always going to happen

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,600
with

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,600
translations either so

00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,120
i think translators can be

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,679
a lot like maintenance for code in many

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,799
respects

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,480
for example uh applications like

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:12,720
libreoffice are really huge

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,640
in terms of of the ui strings uh

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,480
and and documentation and everything

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,679
there's around

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,320
100 000 words in the ui of libreoffice

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,520
and

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,200
half a million words in the in the help

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,799
and i don't know how many words in the

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,159
in the user guides

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,120
so uh really that's uh if you're trying

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,039
to

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,840
improve the translation uh

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:40,640
systematically then

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:43,760
that's a lot like maintaining software

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,080
so there are some kind of challenges

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,080
and

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:53,840
something we as as the

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,320
free and open source software community

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,360
to do

00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:00,400
is try to think of ways how could we

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:03,440
improve sustainability for

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,440
translators also

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,000
so what can you do well at least give

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,280
credits

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,039
give recognition that

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,559
these people are important part of the

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:18,880
community your project

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,880
and

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,600
also something we should try to explore

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:27,679
is to

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,679
try to open up new sources of funding

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:34,320
i think typically

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,440
the idea that people could translate

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,240
software for

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,679
public benefits is not really on the

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,360
radar of most

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:47,200
grant makers like foundations or

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:51,360
or governments

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:54,880
but maybe we should try to put it there

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:57,200
and i don't know maybe

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,559
we could ask also our friendly

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:03,279
multi-billion

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:06,960
dollar software companies but

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:10,640
i don't know what would come out of that

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,559
but if someone someone has

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,159
really good ideas on how we could do

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:18,480
this then

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:22,559
i'm interested in hearing that

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,559
and i think

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:32,240
that was all so

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:35,279
thank you do you have any questions

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,799
thank you thomas um yes there does seem

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,840
to be a couple of questions in the

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,679
shared notes

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:44,960
the first one is does weblake.org

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:48,960
integrate with gitlab

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,960
uh yes i think it does

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:56,400
yes it uh integrates with github and

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:59,440
gitlab and actually there's a

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,960
there's even a no sorry the kind of

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,039
integration that uh these

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:07,520
um it can

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,559
come it's the if you make changes to

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,600
translations in

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:14,720
in web late it can

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,960
commit them automatically to

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,559
to get and and credit you as the

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,679
translator

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:25,279
so this is a kind of very uh

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:28,880
specific form of attribution down to

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:33,279
that do i like a single string

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:36,960
so i like that okay the next question

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:39,679
um is a bit of a long one here we go

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,840
i started in boss contributors doing

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,760
translations around

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,880
but i think the barrier to start was

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,120
very high

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,960
basically only someone with a computer

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,880
science background could do it

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,480
do you think the barrier of entry is

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,320
still high or

00:25:52,480 --> 00:26:00,080
better nowadays

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,080
i think it depends on the project

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,720
if the project is

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,640
if it requires you to

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,520
send patches to mailing lists or or

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,520
something then

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,720
yeah it could be kind of difficult if

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,880
you don't know anything

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,120
anything about version control or

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,080
software development

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,799
but if the project uses something like

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,360
webplate

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:32,240
then it's quite a bit easier

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,960
you need to make an account or maybe you

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,919
can use your

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,120
github or google or something some

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:42,640
account like that

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:45,440
and log on to weblade and

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,360
it's relatively easy to start

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,000
translating

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:53,279
of course it depends on the size of the

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,799
project also so something small is

00:26:53,279 --> 00:27:01,919
easier to get started with than

00:26:54,799 --> 00:27:01,919
