all right i will start

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:10,240
well hello everyone um thanks for coming

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,679
um alan jordan jay and myself martin

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,400
would like to um

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,160
present a new initiative by the gnome

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,199
foundation to support

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,199
community developers

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:25,680
and so why a new initiative you may ask

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,800
um so there's at least three different

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,199
issues that

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,400
needed to be addressed and the first one

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,399
is that

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,239
it's not really clear what is and what

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,800
is not official non-software

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,160
and the board was tasked to to solve the

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,040
this issue

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,760
and it is also true that over the couple

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,719
years

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,879
um there's been a renaissance of uh

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,840
great applications and library built on

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:52,000
top of the known

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:55,760
technologies but we haven't given them

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,440
enough visibility and

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,760
that also comes with the fact that we

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,320
haven't built closer relationship with

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,879
uh

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,600
many talented developers behind this

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,360
software

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,680
from our community so um to solve these

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,680
issues

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,759
um would like to

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,119
introduce the num circle

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:21,600
and like i said it's um

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,159
a new initiative by the non-foundation

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,280
that

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,680
defines a new category of software

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,320
within

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,040
a project with a goal to support our

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,200
community

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,759
developers and how exactly we want to

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,759
support them

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,360
um well first we want to help the

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,600
help them with the promotion and

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,399
advertising of their applications

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,000
to give them more visibility and also

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,600
give them a path

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,640
to become a gnome foundation member

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,920
and have access to all the benefits and

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,960
also give them

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,399
access to our instructor um to make

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,280
their lives easier

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,280
if they need it

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,319
so what are the requirements to join the

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,319
uh the circle

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,000
well for both applications and

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,000
libraries uh we of course are looking

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,280
the best of the best but

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,319
that doesn't mean that we won't um help

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,520
you to get there

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,840
by giving you the feedback you need and

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,920
um

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,519
of course you must be licensed of under

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,800
uh open source initiative

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:37,280
approved license and no uh

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,959
not any kind of must not have any kind

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,959
of contributor license agreement

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,760
um specifically for applications of

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,000
course they must be built on top of the

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,959
known platform including gdk

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,720
for the user interface and the user

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,480
experience in general must be aligned

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,959
with the guidelines

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,640
and uh integrated properly with uh the

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,080
non desktop

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,159
and it should be available as a flat

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:08,640
plug and preferably on flat

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:10,959
ask for a libraries um

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,239
yeah they need to extend or our current

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,959
platform for example

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,319
they need to target g-lib based

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,120
applications

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,920
and follow the same um coding guidelines

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,760
as any other

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,560
um library and of course be used by

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,519
um other projects from our community and

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,720
things like

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:36,640
well good documentation etc

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:39,120
so the ultimate goal of the num circle

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,319
is to bring together everything great

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,680
that is made for

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:47,280
and with the the known platform so

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,560
um we welcome you to um to apply

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,000
and to visit our website so

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,599
we have over six minutes for questions

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,840
so

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:04,080
um i don't know if i

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:07,599
can make alan part of the

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,599
yeah can you make alan and

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:14,720
presenter as well oh that's great

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,560
you're immediate so there if there's any

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:29,840
questions i think we can

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:29,840
answer those now we have time

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,320
oh alan you seem to have joined with the

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,320
headphones so we cannot hear you

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,840
yeah you have to join with a microphone

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
option

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,440
yeah yeah you have to rejoin rejoin i

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,479
suppose then

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,479
yeah refresh the page

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,080
and it will show you an option to join

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,880
with the microphone

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,880
so we can hear you

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,039
i don't know maybe if the admin has but

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:11,840
anyway um

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:11,840
i'm looking at the other share notes

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,120
um well i'm not i personally don't know

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,120
much about the

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,240
the kde manifesto so i don't know if

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,240
alan knows about it

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
um

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,000
yeah i don't know what's that i'm not

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:37,280
all that familiar either

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,520
um maybe if the

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,520
uh whoever asked that question wants to

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,440
give us some background

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,759
well yeah i asked the question and so it

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,280
just seemed

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,880
like a similar aspect to the kd

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,639
manifesto where we say

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,000
if you want to be a kde project this is

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,160
what you need to

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,759
um the attributes that you need to have

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,039
and everybody needs to have

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,720
commit access to your code um

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,120
and in return host or a code and we'll

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,120
promote

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,560
the other aspects that we haven't gotten

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,319
a kidney manifesto is

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,479
a sort of certificate type program where

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,960
we say this is a good example of a kd

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,000
project

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:24,080
because it fits in with our api guides

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,759
it it's available through um

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,520
packaged through this way and that and

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,720
it's maintained and released

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,160
and so we don't have any kind of

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,240
certificate which we've spoken about a

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:38,000
lot but we haven't got anywhere with

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,000
okay if that compares

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,280
um yeah thanks jonathan it

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,840
it sounds like a circle is a little

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,000
different

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:53,919
um in the sense that

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,919
one of the goals here is to

00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,880
broaden our definition of

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:04,160
who can be included so the requirements

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:07,280
are a lot lower than for a

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,280
a core known module or call home

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,880
application

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,840
um so you don't have to be hosted on

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,039
their infrastructure

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,759
um you don't have to follow known

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,410
release on

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,039
release schedules um

00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:25,919
[Music]

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,479
you don't have to give commit access to

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,520
other members of the loan project

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:34,880
and so you know someone can be

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,840
on github writing an app using

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,520
the known platform and if they fulfill

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,160
the other criteria if it's

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,960
if it's um if it's free software and so

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,400
on

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,240
and it's using our technology then

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,479
they would still they would still

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,919
qualify um

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,599
but that's one of the well that's one of

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,599
the main purposes of this is to

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,199
widen the circle to grow the circle to

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,800
say you don't have to be a

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,800
core member of the known um project

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,080
to be value buyers to be supportive

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,520
buyers

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,240
um or to have an important role to play

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,639
and we will

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,400
you know we're gonna if you're

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,840
developing a great application

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,199
but it's just your own personal

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,720
application but it's still using our

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:27,840
platform then that's something that we

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:27,840
care about and that we will support

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,120
yeah there's another question

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,320
would it be possible to update design

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,519
guidelines so

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,479
more apps will have num like feeling i

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,760
think that will help

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,760
with better apps overall

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:55,760
um yeah i'm not sure

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:57,279
that maybe doesn't seem

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,360
i guess that's more general question

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,240
rather than uh being specific to gnome

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,120
circle but

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,160
um yeah it's still interesting i mean

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,160
over on the

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,959
uh known design side we've been talking

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,360
for some time about updating the design

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,279
guidelines uh that's something that we

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,880
really want to do it's just finding the

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,920
time to do it

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,440
um but definitely i think with the next

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,279
major version of those we'll have

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:26,320
something that's

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,360
will you know it'll be more it'll be

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,680
easier to use

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,720
and the the guidelines themselves will

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,480
produce much

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,240
better looking applications so that

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,600
would certainly be

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:40,720
relevant at circle applications
