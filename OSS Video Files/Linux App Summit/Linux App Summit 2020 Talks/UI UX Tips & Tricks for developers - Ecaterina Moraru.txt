Description: 
	I will present some general UI/UX tips & tricks that will help you design better. Everyone should know the basic principles and patterns of design, and once you understand them you will naturally integrate them in your work.

Understanding basic design principles will provide an advantage when creating or contributing to your favorite Open Source project.
