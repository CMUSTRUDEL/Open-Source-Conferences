Title: UI UX Tips & Tricks for developers - Ecaterina Moraru
Publication date: 2020-11-15
Playlist: Linux App Summit 2020 Talks
Description: 
	I will present some general UI/UX tips & tricks that will help you design better. Everyone should know the basic principles and patterns of design, and once you understand them you will naturally integrate them in your work.

UI/UX is a craft. The more you practice it, the better you are at it. Some people argue that you need to have 'good taste' in order to be a designer, to be the 'artsy type'. While this might be true for Graphic Design, Branding and Visual Arts in general, when it comes to Interface, Interaction and Product Design, the focus is more on practicality and 'common sense'.

Understanding basic design principles will provide an advantage when creating or contributing to your favorite Open Source project.

who will be giving us a splendid talk on

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,039
ui ux trips and tricks for dev

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,680
developers i already followed the tricks

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,000
and trips she gave us in fosdem 20.

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,680
so ladies and gentlemen i request a huge

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,920
round of applause for her all the best

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,920
ma'am

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,399
oh my god thank you so much for this

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,440
introduction i feel like

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,559
yeah the audience is so happy

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,680
yeah hello everyone nice to be here uh

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,480
my name is ikatina moraru and um i want

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,520
to talk a bit

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,039
about ui tips and tricks

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,719
uh i said that there are four developers

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,239
but

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,360
i mean they are for everyone i mean

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:58,160
developers are just humans right

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,199
but why do i think it's important to to

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,840
know at least the

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,120
the base things regarding the uix is

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,400
because

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,760
uh we have this um

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,760
i don't know this disapproval inside our

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,400
open source communities that the

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,759
interfaces are not good enough and not

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,400
enough designers are available to

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,200
to help with uh with the project we're

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,560
working on

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:28,640
so i think it would be very helpful for

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,119
any developer to to know some some basic

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,320
when they're doing their uh their

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,360
interfaces

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,400
uh personally i work as an user

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,960
experience designer

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,079
and i've contributed in open source for

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,040
the past

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,159
12 years and i would love to have more

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,040
designers

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,159
uh involved i don't know in making open

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,159
source is so much

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,920
greater than than it already is um

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,680
if you have questions please ask them

00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,000
when you have them i mean i

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,240
tend to talk very fast so uh

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,360
yeah if you have questions just address

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,399
them now

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:11,440
um okay um

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,480
all right okay

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,599
so uh just like in programming

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,400
let me use this slide

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,959
uh just like in programming we also have

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:27,040
some patterns in the user experience

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,520
field uh the patterns can be

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,200
i don't know it depends very much on the

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,519
on the platform i mean

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,239
there are some patterns for for web and

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,519
for for

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,640
for mobile but uh the patterns are

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,800
considered to be

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,560
let's say the next level in this

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,680
presentation i'm going to

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,720
to go even lower and even

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,920
basic just like learning css or

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,040
learning the the algorithmic part of in

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,360
programming

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,800
and we're going to cover uh some of the

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,040
principles and principles

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,640
are just fundamental rules about the

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,440
practice of design

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,879
and there are many principles i'm kind

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,280
of

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,720
mixing principle and examples in my

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,159
presentation but

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,879
the the biggest biggest principle that

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,440
everybody

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,120
should should try to apply in the

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,640
interfaces they are creating is

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,760
consistency

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,879
and i don't know as a beginner you

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,239
should make that

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,840
your uh your main rule that everything

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,400
needs to be consistent

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,360
uh if you go to the advanced level let's

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,480
say

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,760
there are some corner cases where

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,920
consistency

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,799
can be broken but in the majority of

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,120
cases

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,080
uh if you stick to the consistency rule

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,239
then you're be

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,080
on the safe side for the majority of

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,400
things that that you're doing

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,159
and what exactly it means to to be

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,319
consistent it means that

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,680
uh similar objects should have similar

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,720
meaning and function

00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,319
uh if something behaves in a certain way

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,200
a user learns that once and then uh

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,319
she will know that that thing or object

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,439
will behave the same

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,239
next time when consistency is broken we

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,599
have that

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:15,200
confusion moment and the users

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:18,799
are not sure what exactly happened

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:23,600
and uh also it would be

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,600
very nice i mean to to take the same

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,680
principle or things that we see in the

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,880
surrounding world and apply them in our

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,680
interface i mean

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,720
if we see that everywhere on the

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,160
applications

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,160
when you click on the logo it takes you

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,800
to the homepage uh

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,840
you should do that also in our

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,600
applications i mean

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,800
um having a consistency inside an

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,400
application is great but having

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,360
consistency across

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,160
multiple websites and software is even

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,199
better

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,600
because uh the user don't need to read

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,199
any

00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:00,240
any of the manual um

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,320
okay and consistency

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,160
as a principle can be applied to

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,080
anything starting from buttons and

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,360
continuing to

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:14,400
all kinds of ui elements

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:17,840
and even if the buttons needs to be

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,919
consistent uh there are several types of

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,479
consistency we can apply i mean

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,400
uh doesn't mean that you need to be

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,560
consistent on

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,400
one type i mean there can be consistency

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,800
in subtypes and buttons

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,759
can be split and should be split i mean

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,320
if you split them

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,320
uh it's going to increase the visibility

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,680
uh you can split the buttons in the two

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,560
categories like time

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,600
primary and secondary actions i mean

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,440
when you have

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:49,600
a page or or screen in an application

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,639
um you should present to the user what

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,039
is the

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,560
main action what is the call to action

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,560
that that you want that user to

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,840
to follow and to do on that particular

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,600
screen

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,039
uh and uh there are several ways to do

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,960
that like i don't know like floating

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,600
buttons like you know the places that we

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,560
see

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,120
uh on the on the corner of our screen or

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,600
uh

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,120
i don't know but no matter how you

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,560
decide to represent

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,639
this uh they should be marked uh with a

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,199
more predominant color in order to

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,680
attract the attention of the user and

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,720
everything

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,360
else all the other uh actions you have

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,080
present them as secondary actions

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,919
sometimes

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,400
there can be like tertiary like you know

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,560
like cancel or like

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,319
other things that you know for sure the

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,080
user might not need

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:44,400
uh but have at least uh one primary

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:48,319
action and represented in um in a

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,400
in a very clear way and uh when you

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,240
represent this action make sure

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:58,080
that uh you are using verbs as action

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,560
um we've seen a lot buttons that have

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,800
like

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,840
okay or read more or

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,280
i don't know even next can be ambiguous

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:12,160
but uh it would be so much

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,280
easier for the user to know exactly what

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,840
it will happen

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,800
if you press that button so using verbs

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,599
helps the user

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,560
do that because uh user's thinking verb

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,639
when they are

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,720
on the screen they might want to add

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:29,280
something or delete or edit

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,479
and not second-guessing what that button

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,120
does

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,160
or not needing to to read the

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,319
description text

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,479
every time she does that will help them

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,520
make that decision faster

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:44,800
um also when we are

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:48,400
writing hints or or labels

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:52,080
that help uh describe

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,879
the action uh make sure you are using

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,120
natural language and not very technical

00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,879
terms i mean in open source it's

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,199
it's so often that you see

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,720
uh concepts that are not explained to

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,319
the user

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:11,759
and uh a lot of abbreviation

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,319
and things that for the normal users

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,319
they

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,360
not necessarily know what it means and

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,000
that's why

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,479
the interfaces can be perceived as as

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,479
scary

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,240
regarding consistency it would be ideal

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,440
if

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,560
you would also preserve the the tone of

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,279
the way you are um are phrasing

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,800
the things like like being friendly and

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,519
keeping the same tone

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,719
uh everywhere and and i know this is

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,279
very hard because

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,680
uh as developers we are we are

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,640
preferring so much to be efficient and

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,880
we know that

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:51,680
just with one acronym we are saying

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,600
so much more but uh it is very important

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,000
to know what is your

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,920
target audience and and try to be

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,480
empathic and put yourself in the other

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,720
shoes

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,000
and think the of the users that don't

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,680
know anything about

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,560
your interface okay so i hope i won't

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,839
see

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:13,040
buttons anymore with uh

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,680
with okay or or

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,680
stuff like that

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:22,959
um bucket placement

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:25,120
can also possess some issues and

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,600
questions especially for people that

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,000
that are not very comfortable designing

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,240
interfaces

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,519
sometimes we look for inspiration in

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,760
some screens and we see that

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,600
uh i don't know in some screens we see

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,399
them on the right side or on the left

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,920
side

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:47,839
if you are designing for um

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,959
for uh devices the manufacturers of

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,800
these devices

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:55,279
um i mean the operating system people

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,360
are usually providing also guidelines

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,680
and style guides on where exactly the

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,720
button is to be placed and unfortunately

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:06,000
uh some platforms prefer it one way and

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,920
others prefer it the other way uh

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,360
but again as long as it's consistent

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,000
everywhere on that platform

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,680
it's great but when you are trying to

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,160
make the decision for yourself maybe you

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,279
are

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,000
designing for web and on the web uh we

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,320
don't have very

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,320
clear rules or where to place them

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,560
what could help you make that decision

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:32,160
is understanding

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:35,040
the the reading reading

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,640
that the user does so for example um in

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,839
the left line

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,640
the user could just read the read the

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,839
title

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,000
and maybe go directly to the

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,680
to the bottom that is the action so the

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,760
flow can be very linear

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,760
but for example i don't know when we

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,800
have confirmation dialogues

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,720
uh it's very good that we have them and

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,640
we should be very explicit of what are

00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,600
the consequences of that dialogue but

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,079
this means that

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,079
the user should read what's what's

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:07,440
stating time i don't know are we

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,240
i'm also deleting this uh records from

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,399
the database

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,920
am i am i affecting something else can i

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,240
go back etc

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,920
so the pattern the user does it will be

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,360
it will read the text it will

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,640
read the the description and then it

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,920
will go to the

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,279
uh secondary button and he could

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,120
continue because that's what we want

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,640
them to do he continues on the primary

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,680
button on the left

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:35,839
aligned side he will need to make

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:39,360
this going back in order to

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:42,880
to keep the the

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:47,360
to make the action so uh

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:49,680
yeah think about uh if

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,560
if you prefer to have the the vertical

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,480
scanning

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,560
or if you need this but no matter what

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,320
decision you you make

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,880
you should make this decision only once

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,680
and then apply it to all the forms and

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,720
all the buttons across your interface

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,360
um a lot regarding mobile devices

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,360
um

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:14,800
this let's say this screen

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,680
when it's either left or right it's not

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,560
very important

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,320
when the display is very very little

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,279
because uh the distance

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,519
from left to right is like i don't know

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,880
300 to 600 pixel depth

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:31,519
resolution um

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,920
and sometimes i you can also see on the

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,959
mobile devices buttons that are

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,600
centered or that are full width

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,800
or input i don't know like vertical one

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,120
after the other

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,480
so on mobile doesn't matter that much

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,680
but on the web

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,519
if we have very large uh displays

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,040
uh and for example like here we don't

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,240
have columns i mean when you have larger

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,560
display you can

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,600
uh group and split the content into

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,839
multiple areas each with their own um

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,360
layout but let's say if you would have

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,760
something like this

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,880
uh even let's say if you would have

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,639
preferred

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,480
the left alignment because of that

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,639
faster millisecond

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,160
uh in that in this case it will not be

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,519
that efficient because

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:18,560
you kind of lose the context between the

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,360
the text and uh and the buttons

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,720
so yeah you kind of need to know uh

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,600
exactly

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,720
what resolution you're designing uh what

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,320
are the cases

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,639
and sometimes it's it's okay to

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,079
make some screens or or reiterate

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,040
because you know you

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,560
it's not wonderful i mean we can see the

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,560
screens after and and

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,959
and go back in the interface and fix

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,320
them and decide later even though it's

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:47,680
not very efficient

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,519
from um from implementation you but i i

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,279
think it's better if you fix them later

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:56,000
and you produce ability than and

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:59,120
then the work needed to do that um

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,360
regarding placement uh sometimes

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,320
buttons feel more natural if they are

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,480
placed on the right

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:10,160
side let's say in the case of wizards

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,079
but this depends um very much on the

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,240
culture you are designing for

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,440
and again you need to know your target

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,320
audience i mean

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,199
in in western culture we are reading the

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,800
book from right

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,040
right to left and we are reading from

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,040
our

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,360
left right so we it's natural for us to

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,399
i don't know to make the same movement

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,760
like uh

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:37,440
the pages on a book um

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:40,079
uh but uh not every culture

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,720
reads this way and i don't even want to

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,560
go

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:48,639
in the uh i don't know japanese uh

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:52,320
or or other

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,519
asian reading directions because they

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,560
can also be

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,519
vertical um

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,480
but the point was here that uh for

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,800
wizards

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,079
it feels natural to have next on the

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,920
right alignment

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,360
but no matter where you place them

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,399
another tip

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,079
that you need to know is that the

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,440
primary button needs to be

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:18,160
placed near the the edges i mean

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,760
uh you should not place the primary

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,040
action in the middle

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,399
uh think about the direction you want

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,519
the user to go

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,600
and place the most important action

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,600
near the edge because it will be much

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,560
easier to be found

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,560
by your user

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:42,000
colorized meaning it's

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,279
very important and it's very interesting

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,279
to look at i mean

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,480
i'm making a generalization here and

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,880
it's not true but

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,079
i wanted to say that uh open source

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,600
projects have a lot of

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:56,240
blue and it is great because blue means

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,040
i don't know trust and we want with our

00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,240
application

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,639
especially because they're kind of

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:05,120
technical and kind of advanced to to

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:08,800
to inspire the user we trust

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,880
uh but keep in mind that colors

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,920
again depending on the culture have some

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,600
meaning and

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,360
depending on the culture it's again an

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,160
important note because

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,360
uh danger in western means uh and it's

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,639
used for

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,240
errors and um

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,079
i don't know destructive actions and

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,600
things that could go bad

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:32,800
while uh in asia red means

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,839
auspicious and a lot and all the good

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,079
things so

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:41,519
um yeah um

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,519
think about that and uh

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,440
i mean it would be great to and

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,519
depending again on your audience if you

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,959
want uh younger audiences

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:56,320
you might want to to use black oh sure

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:59,199
we we love black and open search right

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,480
it looks more more geekish uh but i

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,279
don't know maybe you would want to use

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,360
purple or

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:08,959
oranges um think about uh

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,520
how other people are are using and i

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,360
know

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,559
we want to to be different and we want

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,799
to be unique but

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,319
sometimes people come with expectations

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,000
uh of what they've seen in

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,079
in other places and i don't know maybe

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,039
they expect

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,559
some green uh sites and colors to be

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,600
used by uh

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,440
pharma or i don't know

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,960
in the branding part it can be a lot of

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,880
discussion so

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,320
sticking to the blue it's actually a

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,080
good point because

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,000
i don't know if you can go wrong with

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,440
that um

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,360
but what i've talked until now is mostly

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,280
of having like an accent color and a

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:50,080
brand new color that you can apply

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:52,799
to the majority of your style guide

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,679
but in theory you could have multiple

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,360
colors

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,280
for buttons i mean you can have like a

00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,880
success in warning and info and

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:04,640
if you were to use a

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:07,200
i don't know a ui uh

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,440
framework like bootstrap or or a library

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,240
that

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,240
provides the the code already done they

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,799
usually provide uh

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,440
this kind of specialty buttons this

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,360
doesn't mean

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,880
if they are there that we should use

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,720
them and generally

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,640
we should try to limit the the color

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,360
selection we are making

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,320
um and another note about the color that

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,799
i want to make

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,400
um i mean in this case it's very nice

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,080
because it's a success and warning but

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,360
imagine that you would have

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:40,559
like um a word that

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,200
it's ambiguous you don't know exactly if

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,720
it's a

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:48,240
success or or if it's danger and

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,880
you you as a designer rely on the color

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,760
and that person that is viewing this

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,840
screen

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,799
might be colorblind or not necessarily

00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:00,000
um

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,360
identify the color and or or understand

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,480
exactly the meaning that you're trying

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,160
to convey

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:09,280
uh don't don't rely only on

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:12,400
on color uh that's why uh

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,160
a good practice is to uh i don't know

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,600
put like an icon or or

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,720
try to make another

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:24,720
shaving or some background thing

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:27,280
that can uh adds to the

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,880
diversification of the icon a bit more

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,799
for the people that

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,320
that don't necessarily differentiate

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,480
colors and this is more related to

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,420
accessibility but it's good to have it

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,600
as a mention

00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,520
[Applause]

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,200
and why should we have destructive

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,080
colors and actions

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,280
um again this might break a bit the

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,600
consistency

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,640
uh the thing that we were talking in the

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,320
first thing

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,480
but this can be a good ba a good thing

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,840
if we are using it with caution i mean

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,880
if we are consistent throughout the

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,000
interface

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,640
and users know that that button needs to

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
be blue

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,600
and they see that button to be uh to be

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,200
read they might say okay this is

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,480
something special

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,200
maybe i need to pay careful attention to

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,480
it

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,600
and again don't rely just on putting

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,120
that color and

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:22,000
making sure that the users will know

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,039
the consequence of their action always

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,960
try to

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,039
to have a confirmation for destructive

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,600
action explain very well

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,360
what they are doing in case the user is

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,400
not able to

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,520
to recover the things that they are

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,039
deleting you know

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:42,320
there are several patterns here like

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:44,320
even very not hardcore i can say but

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,760
you know when you were requesting the

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,760
user to type

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,000
the the name of the folder they want to

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,400
delete or to really type delete i mean

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,440
these are are not necessarily good

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,520
practices but

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,600
there are some um some ways to ensure

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,360
uh that the user is know what they're

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,360
doing i would not encourage these kinds

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,360
of things because they kind of increase

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:13,039
the time to to to make that action

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,880
yes sure the user will be uh very aware

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,039
that he is doing something bad but he

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,520
also be very scared

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,159
about ever touching that that piece of

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,080
uh

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:26,880
of uh functionality there ideally

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,000
we should provide support for andu and

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,880
uh

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,480
it's it's so funny when uh as a designer

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,840
you go to the developers and ask them

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,840
for undo and

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,200
i mean the you

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,880
the requirements to have this kind of

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,120
functionality are are

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,080
so much difficult from an implementation

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,799
point of view

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,760
but are so much nicer on on the user

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,240
side and you

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,320
always need to make this balance of

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,840
deciding

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:59,840
what size you want to to make happier

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:02,480
um okay and uh

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,840
yeah i mean you use them as blue because

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,640
they should be consistent but it's

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,840
better if you

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,840
if you put them as red

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:16,559
for this it's a principle that

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:19,440
is widely used and

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,760
wisely found and it's so much nicer when

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,760
it's

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:25,840
well implemented and the metaphor for

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,440
understanding affordance

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,320
it's uh the the doors so if you want to

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,440
open a door

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,679
and it has like a circular handle uh

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,159
you might know that in order to open

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,480
that door you need to twist the handle

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,240
uh the same is uh when you see the door

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,320
and it has like um

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,440
like this handle like like vertically

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,919
and you can grab it

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,720
you might understand that you need to to

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,720
pull it or

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,200
if it's like flat and you you know that

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,960
you need to push it

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,799
the problem is when uh the affordance

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,280
the door is giving you

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,080
uh doesn't match with the behavior the

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,720
door has

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,480
and that way when you bang your head to

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,320
the door and stuff like that

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:13,360
um so for this means giving cues

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,919
on how the user should

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,480
interact with the interface before they

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,520
even

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,559
pressed it and it can

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,600
be very good if the interface behaves

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:29,039
as the user expects and it can be

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,960
not very bad but it can be confusing and

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,159
annoying and disturbing to the user if

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,080
the interface

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,559
does not behave behave like the user

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,880
expects and i threw but i provided here

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,880
some examples so for example

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,159
let's say that you have some headers and

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,720
you put them in blue

00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,960
but those are not actually links i mean

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,480
if we were to go on a blog platform the

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,760
majority of them are links and you

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,840
expect to go there

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,039
and i don't know read the whole article

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,120
or something

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,640
but if you make them blue and it doesn't

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,240
do anything you'll be like

00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,000
okay it doesn't do anything you learned

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,360
and then you make again the mistake

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,679
so so it it will every time you will

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,559
have this

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,400
i don't know battle inside you of what

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:13,919
does it want from me

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:18,400
uh uh another thing

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:21,279
the same is also for for um

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,640
i mean to differentiate links for from

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:26,080
the content

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,640
um the user might not know that this is

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,200
a link

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,720
it might say i mean in this case it's

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,640
very nice because it says details and

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,200
the others you cannot read but if you

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,120
if it were to be a whole text and having

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,279
only details at the end

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,840
uh you might not know that that that's a

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,840
link so

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,080
for the past i don't know how many years

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,880
these blue

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,520
things and blue links and underlinings

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:55,120
it has been so much blurred

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:58,720
because we have like now style guides of

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,720
every other color but

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,240
some users still expect and if we were

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,120
consistent throughout the interface

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,400
if you will see uh some text that is

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,760
blue and underlined

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,360
i'm i'm i'm assuming that that people

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,679
that that person will know that that's a

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,559
link and and will expect it to building

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,520
so

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,120
uh differentiate the links from the

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,120
content and if you can make them blue

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,840
and underlined that would be a plus

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:28,720
for the usability of your of your

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:32,080
application

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,880
and one of the question is okay

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,919
when to use buttons and when to use

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,200
links

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:41,279
and um let's say

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,279
maybe it's more obvious to not have

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,480
buttons inside of the text

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:49,039
and none as it would i mean

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,640
it it will also look strange but you

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:54,240
will also have some

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,240
line height alignment and

00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:02,640
things will not look good or align good

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:06,240
but the the thing you

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,159
need to know here is that uh buttons and

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,279
links have been created for a very

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:13,600
uh specific purpose and that meaning

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,600
that buttons should be used for actions

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,440
and things that affect the interface i

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,320
mean i don't know that add entry to the

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,200
database

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,600
that changes the state of an object

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,760
while

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:29,360
links create were created mostly for

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,840
for navigating through neck screens or

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,440
to go

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:36,640
other places so we use this thing um

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,919
to add a rule when when trying to decide

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,880
uh what to use when i mean sometimes

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,360
we prefer the look of the links we think

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,279
maybe

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:50,559
it's a bit more more more light

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,559
but if

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,320
you have everything as a link and they

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:57,360
have different behaviors

00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:00,400
this can also be a bit confusing

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,799
um another note that i want to make

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,320
about

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:08,000
buttons and affordance is that uh

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:12,400
traditionally buttons uh have been

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,400
displayed as 3d objects so

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,679
the flat trend kind of removed all the

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:21,840
gradients and all the shadows

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:24,640
etc but uh if you have some shadow

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:27,039
on a thing uh the user might know that

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:31,679
it's it's a 3d it can be clicked because

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:34,399
uh buttons have very specific space

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,480
states of being pressed or or or being

00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:39,520
active or being disabled so

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:42,799
um this kind of things could

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,799
could help the user know

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:51,919
what to do exactly in the interface

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,919
okay um wait

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,679
i want also want to present you some

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,600
proximity some other principle and one

00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,000
of the

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,679
principle is profanity which states that

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,640
objects that are closer together are

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,039
perceived to be

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,799
related and this is very important let's

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,600
say when you're creating an interface

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,720
and

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,080
you want to do some grouping uh i don't

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,640
know you

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,399
want to group all the menus together and

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,480
you put them a bit separate so so the

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:26,399
user know those are related and

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:29,600
the content is put someplace else

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,399
uh or in the case that you you have a

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,559
menu

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:38,000
and uh let's say that that menu has like

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:40,240
five independent things if you

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,440
if some of these things are related i

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,840
don't know

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,159
like in this example from gmail a while

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,600
back uh

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,799
if you have this if that mail is

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,120
important or not

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,840
you could put them more closely together

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,559
to

00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:01,679
to state that that functionality is like

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:03,520
it's like com comes in pairs and it's so

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,039
much easier to scan interface where the

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,880
things are grouped because you can

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,080
just jump from one group to another

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,360
instead of of

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:14,399
trying to go over each of them so

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,360
spacing can be used to provide this kind

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,480
of

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:21,200
grouping and another thing to consider

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,399
is the similarity principle which states

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,200
that

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,559
object sharing attributes are are

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,399
related so

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:33,760
uh if for example you would try to

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:35,600
read this um uh by lines

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,440
let's imagine this word text or

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,480
something uh it will be so

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,679
so much harder than uh reading them by

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,320
colors because

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,880
our brains automatically groups them by

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,559
colors

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,279
by by uh by columns and this grouping

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,320
can be done

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:54,720
using a color or size or shape

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,120
orientation or there are multiple ways

00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,279
in

00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:01,679
in which we we can we can do this

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,279
grouping in others in order to to help

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,120
us navigate and browse

00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,559
you know when we have activity streams

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,399
and we have the avatars

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,840
some avatars are displayed in with

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,399
circulars and we put them

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,960
in the front so the user just jumps from

00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,440
one

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,480
avatar to another without needing to to

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,919
read because

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:23,840
he's expecting uh all the items there to

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,840
be of the same kind

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,240
the law of unity is another principle

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,320
that is kind of

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,720
overriding cues from proximity and

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,200
similarities so it's much stronger in

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,240
the

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:40,559
effect it can have and what does

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:43,760
the what it does is that um

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:45,600
if you provide lines like in this case

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,799
or if you provide boxes or

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:52,159
i don't know um background colors or

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:55,200
or whatever um this additional

00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:59,279
container it's grouping the things

00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:02,640
inside of it um

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:06,080
so this can be

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,840
very powerful i mean again even if you

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,880
would have like

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:15,360
so many uh entries here

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,360
just by putting a background and

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:22,720
a background color it will group your

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,480
form uh and the user will know

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,320
where to look and that those things are

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,559
grouped are grouped

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,240
uh and not regarding this is that we

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:33,120
need to be very careful

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,399
uh in order to not uh overcrowd the

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,679
interface

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:39,360
um the more lines you put the more

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,559
background colors you put the more

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,760
containers you

00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:47,279
you add uh might

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,919
feel a bit heavy uh

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,200
that's why uh in order to have that

00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,240
eerie

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:57,760
and simple and clean uh look

00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,960
uh designers are trying to add as much

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,440
white space as they can and and try to

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,559
limit

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:08,399
the at all uh

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,399
these heavy things but uh

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,440
if if used properly properly it can be a

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,840
very powerful

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:23,440
technique in order to emphasize things

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:26,640
um trace paralysis states that

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,880
if users are going to have lots of

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,080
options they will not know exactly which

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,799
one to pick

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,240
and uh and they will be paralyzed i mean

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,320
is that good for me it's not

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,919
not good for what should i pick and

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,519
hicks loss is that

00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,440
the time to make the decision increases

00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,799
with the number and capacity of choices

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,640
so

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:48,880
what is recommended here is to to

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,919
limit the options we are giving to our

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,600
users

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:56,960
and i've seen a lot of

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:59,600
download pages for our

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,240
open source project that i mean we are

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,240
very

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:07,519
proud that we we are supporting so many

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,399
uh devices and so many platforms and we

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,519
want to

00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:12,799
to let the user know about that uh but

00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,080
that can be

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:18,720
very overwhelming i mean uh we can

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,640
i don't know try to detect the the

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,159
operating system the user is on

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,039
and uh and propose exactly what they

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,159
need

00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:29,840
and uh i don't know if

00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,279
sometimes even for the same operating

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,720
system you have like

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:37,760
uh like a different packaging

00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,000
method so state very clearly

00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,120
what are the differences between between

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,519
the types and

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,799
always always recommend the one that you

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,320
are

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,399
proposing because sometimes we have a

00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:52,480
preference what we want our user

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:54,000
to to try and sometimes in the servers i

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,480
don't know i don't know depends on the

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,679
project

00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:01,360
so it's hard to make a generalization

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:04,240
um a similar

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,960
principle is the seven plus two rule

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:10,560
which uh

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,839
was an experiment done by miller like a

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,679
hundred years ago

00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:19,119
and this psychologist we investigated

00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:22,560
how many words

00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,919
can somebody put in their short-term

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,720
memory

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:27,520
and not forget and the results then were

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,119
like seven

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:34,480
plus minus two items and this argument

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:36,800
was um used for a very long time uh

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,919
in order to limit the things in menus i

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,119
mean if you

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:43,599
had like more than seven plus two things

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,560
uh it was outrageous and you needed to

00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,520
to limit

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,079
now new research has been made and the

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,800
the

00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,119
estimate dropped to four plus minus one

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,399
but

00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:57,359
there's not not really a number that

00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:58,320
uh can be given uh because it depends so

00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:01,359
much on

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,720
on so many other factors the conclusion

00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:06,800
here is that uh in our interfaces we

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,160
should recommend and provide as fewer

00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,160
options or try to

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,760
to group them or present them in in

00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:17,520
other screens in order

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:21,520
for the interface to look digestible um

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:24,079
yeah i've seen some so so many

00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,320
sites and sometimes we in open source we

00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,320
take pride in being very

00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,520
uh thorough and having all the

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,440
information needed but

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,320
uh sometimes that can can look so so

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:39,040
hard

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:42,839
and and so hard to digest um

00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,000
okay third position effect states that

00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,760
um uh

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,359
we remember ben the first and the last

00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,520
item in the series

00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,800
uh the example here is with the alphabet

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,119
we know it starts with a

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,240
and ends with z but uh maybe in the

00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:59,200
middle some things

00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:01,359
get confusing for some people and

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,880
this can be also combined with the with

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:06,240
the chunking principle

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,079
that say that if you have a lot of

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,160
information it would be good to

00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,240
break it in smaller chunks and in this

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,240
case instead of having a navigation

00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,560
that has like nine items just break them

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,320
in in

00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,640
smaller things and for each of this

00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:24,320
group you will have a first and the last

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:26,640
and the uh first and last will be

00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,760
will be so much visible than what's

00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,040
inside

00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,839
um because sometimes we say uh

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,680
okay maybe the most important thing put

00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:37,440
them on the first position and second

00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,960
position and that is great

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,760
for for things that are in a single line

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,880
uh but we can use this too if if i don't

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,200
know we have multiple

00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,119
things than two that we want to to

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,520
highlight

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,520
um

00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,920
four fields have a lot of things that

00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,160
can

00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:02,400
can be given uh as tips of

00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,760
what to do uh chunking can also be

00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,760
applied to phone numbers

00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:11,760
because

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:14,880
it's so much easier to remember

00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:18,400
things in chunks of two trees and

00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,880
you can also size fields accordingly uh

00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,880
if that field is just three characters

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,200
or or you know the size of the the zip

00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,320
code

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:29,280
just provides the exact

00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,800
dimension that you want the the user to

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,839
to enter that information

00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,240
inside um

00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,520
highlighting and explaining the error in

00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,760
the context that it

00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,800
occurs it's so much better than having a

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,359
generic

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,160
uh place where you can look for their

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:47,280
messages

00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,960
or how we've done it for our project the

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,240
user needed to look in the

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,240
in the console to find out the error

00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,040
that happened on the server no it would

00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,359
be so much

00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,480
a great effort for them to to have the

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:02,160
error inside

00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:06,320
the interface um

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:09,440
numbers should be uh right aligned

00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:12,960
uh because it's so much easier to

00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:15,680
to uh compare them

00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:19,520
by decimals and by hundreds than just

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:21,839
having a random alignment for them

00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,839
and

00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,160
this happens also i don't know you can

00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,320
mark

00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,520
things that are secondary information

00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,960
with another color

00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,800
and keep the alignment good so that

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,040
people can compare the things that they

00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,599
are

00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,280
interested in i'm trying to go a bit

00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,480
faster because i don't think i don't

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,079
know how much time we

00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,839
we still have um and we are we are

00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,000
closing and i would want to see some

00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:50,160
questions i feel we have to questions

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,480
uh but as a closing note

00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,520
i want to say again i want to say some

00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,079
things about the

00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,079
icons

00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,520
we are past the interface that are only

00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,400
text based and icons are very strong

00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,760
because

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:09,520
uh users learn them once and then

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:12,320
they can apply that knowledge uh

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,280
with subsequent usages and just navigate

00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,000
to that

00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,200
uh sometimes it's very hard to find the

00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,040
right icon or

00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,640
even if you think you find the right the

00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,640
right icon that i continue

00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,720
so many things in this case this can be

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,839
a search this can be a zoom

00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,440
or it can be just a ping-pong puzzle so

00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:31,839
again know your target

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,880
and always test the interface that that

00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:36,880
you're doing

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:40,720
but um having icons

00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:44,640
uh is something that will make your

00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:47,040
your interface uh much uh

00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,040
much easier to organize indigest after

00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,359
not necessarily for beginner user but

00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,400
for

00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:56,160
for advanced user we they will know

00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:59,040
where to jump um

00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,760
these are just a few of the principles

00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,599
and uh

00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,040
i don't know if you're passionate or not

00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,119
about uh

00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,720
these kind of things but the ux field

00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:10,000
has like i don't know like from

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:12,400
psychological tips and tricks to

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,119
things that come from visual arts and

00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,400
it's it's

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:19,520
such a diverse field and that with

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:23,359
very little information you can

00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:26,560
bring so much benefit for the end user

00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,560
so yeah uh

00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,680
can uh

00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:37,200
i will want to ask you some questions

00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,000
okay thank you mom uh we definitely have

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,800
some questions but

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,480
um unfortunately we are out of time so i

00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,760
can address these questions in the chat

00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,760
box and thank you mom

00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,720
and you can you can you can send the

00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,720
questions at my twitter handle

00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,240
and thank you so much for inviting me

00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,280
and have a great day

00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,280
