Playlist: Linux App Summit 2020 Talks
Description: 
	The ever growing popularity of ARM devices has meant a new market for Linux apps. However, unlike conventional platforms where we enjoy the stability of a well tested graphics stack, platforms based on the ARM architecture tend to be quirkier.

In this talk, I'll be talking about the basics of how the Linux Graphics stack works touching on how technologies such as DRM, DRI, and Mesa interact with each other and the history behind how we've come to the current Gallium design in mesa.

At the end of the talk attendees should have a better understanding of what goes on behind the scenes in the graphics world and a high level understanding of the Mesa/DRM architecture.

Furthermore, this should help Linux app developers gain a better understanding of mesa and allow for faster debugging of graphics issues on ARM devices.
