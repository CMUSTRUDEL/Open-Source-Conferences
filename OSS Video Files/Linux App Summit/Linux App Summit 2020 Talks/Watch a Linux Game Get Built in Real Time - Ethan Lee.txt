Title: Watch a Linux Game Get Built in Real Time - Ethan Lee
Publication date: 2020-11-15
Playlist: Linux App Summit 2020 Talks
Description: 
	There is a lot of discussion about how apps should be built, but has anyone watched an app actually get built? Behold, a something-hour time slot where you literally just watch Linux game porter Ethan Lee build Linux games. What you will see is completely uncensored and is actually, seriously how he builds programs that may very well be installed on your very computer at this exact moment in time. No joke. Compare the resulting footage to everything else you see at the summit and attempt to measure the delta accordingly.

Ethan "flibitijibibo" Lee has developed over 60 commercial Linux games over the past 8 years, including FEZ, Celeste, Streets of Rage 4, Bastion, Transistor, VVVVVV, Super Hexagon, Proteus, Eversion, Dust: An Elysian Tail, 5D Chess (yes, an actual playable 5D Chess), and Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator. He is extremely sorry for this so-called presentation.
