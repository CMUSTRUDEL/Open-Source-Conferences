Description: 
	Snaps are confined, standalone Linux applications bundled with all the necessary dependencies to run independently. They are designed to simplify development and deployment of software, and make it easier for users to discover applications. Sounds like an enticing idea ... but where do you start?

This presentation unveils the boffinry of the snap ecosystem. It introduces and highlights the steps needed to package applications as snaps, including the underlying snap technology and mechanisms. The session will cover the building blocks used in the snapcraft.yaml file required to turn Linux applications into snaps, with overview of capabilities, confinement, interfaces, plugins, and more. By moving all the cruft behind the scenes, now all it takes is one simple recipe to build software with fun and ease.
