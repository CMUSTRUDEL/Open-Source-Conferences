Description: 
	PipeWire has been making a lot of progress lately on providing a drop-in replacement audio server that unifies the PulseAudio and JACK APIs. Recently, it was announced that it is ready for general testing and at this rate it should be ready to be distributed as a replacement of PulseAudio in 2021.

Looking in the future, though, we need to ask ourselves... how can PipeWire improve the user experience? Does it actually bring any value to end users that have never heard of JACK before? Does it bring any changes?

In this talk, George is going to give an overview of how a PipeWire-enabled system looks like and behaves at the moment and then take a glimpse in the future, looking at ideas, which are already being worked on, that could revolutionize the user experience in an environment as complex as the desktop - with your help!
