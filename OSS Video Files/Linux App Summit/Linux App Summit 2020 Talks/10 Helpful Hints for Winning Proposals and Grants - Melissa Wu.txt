thank you for having me i

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,040
was having some problems with my

00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,040
microphone earlier so if

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,639
there are any issues uh definitely let

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,880
me know in the chat

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,320
but as christy mentioned my name is

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,560
melissa wu

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,480
i am the project manager at the gnome

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,800
foundation for the community

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,080
engagement challenge and today i'm going

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,640
to talk to you

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,920
a little deviation from the previous

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,000
presentations

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,760
um and programming and and go a little

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,920
bit lighter a little bit fuzzier

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,360
to helpful hints for creating

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,559
award-winning responses

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:45,440
to grants challenges and rfps or

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:48,640
requests for proposals

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,600
so a little bit about me i am in

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,160
california

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,000
california in the united states i went

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,120
to the university of pennsylvania where

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,920
i received an

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,440
undergraduate degree in sociology and

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,239
then the university of southern

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,760
california

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,359
where i received a master's in business

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,400
administration

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,240
i worked for a number of years as a

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,200
technology consultant

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,320
where i spent time creating requests for

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,560
proposals

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,360
responding to requests for proposals and

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,400
evaluating

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,240
requests for proposals i also own and

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,920
started a travel agency

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,520
where as part of my responsibilities

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,600
and sort of related to travel but not

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,920
really i'm a grant manager

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,520
and so i have spent time responding to

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,079
grants creating them

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,799
and evaluating them and then with the

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,000
gnome

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,799
um foundation as i said i am the

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,520
community engagement challenge manager

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,799
and

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,920
um through that program we created a

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,040
challenge and we put out a request for

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,520
responses

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,399
and then um worked with the judges to

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,520
help evaluate

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,240
those responses so all in uh probably

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,280
spent

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,079
time reviewing creating and

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,520
responding to over thousands of requests

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:08,160
for proposals over

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,679
the last uh i don't know 10 years or so

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,280
i'm here today to talk to you a little

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,520
bit about

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,959
the community engagement challenge which

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,200
was a

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,000
opportunity that was created earlier

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,879
this year

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,560
and launched in april 2020. we did it in

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,480
partnership with endless

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,720
in order to find projects that would

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,599
encourage individuals or teams

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,519
to submit stimulating ideas that would

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,840
connect the next generation of coders to

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,519
the floss community

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,000
improve the coding skills of beginner

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,800
coders by introducing them to the floss

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,640
community

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,360
and then encouraging fast community

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,760
participation for years to come

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,720
we received over 150 proposals in the

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,200
first phase

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,400
and actually we just closed phase two in

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,239
early november

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,080
and will be kicking off phase three in

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,760
december

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,200
that's an overview of the program but

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,680
you're probably wondering why i'm

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,519
sharing this with you

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,560
well of the 150 applications we received

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:09,120
we didn't receive very many from

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,800
oops i hit the wrong button we didn't

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:19,840
respond hit the wrong button again

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:19,840
sorry hold on

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,360
um i'm sorry give me a second to try and

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,360
make my screen

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,760
um we didn't receive very many

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,480
submissions from

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,959
um the asian side of the world and i

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,000
don't know

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:39,519
if this was because of awareness

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,799
or because of a lack of interest or

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,640
a lack of confidence in how to apply so

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,000
one of the reasons why i wanted to do

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,480
this presentation

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,159
is to make sure that you're aware of

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,840
opportunities like this challenge

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,319
because i hope that we do this again in

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,640
the future and so now you can say you

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,439
are aware that these might happen again

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,360
and i want to improve your confidence in

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,840
applying for something like this

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,080
so that you know that you are setting

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,959
yourself up for success in responding to

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,959
these opportunities

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,560
and so now you're aware so

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,439
congratulations you're aware of an

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,680
opportunity

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,199
i call it an opportunity very generally

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,880
that this could be

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,040
a grant it could be a request for

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,840
proposal it could be a challenge or a

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,840
contest

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,759
but it is in fact an opportunity it's an

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,720
opportunity for you to share about your

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,120
project

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,320
and an opportunity for somebody to give

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,400
you some support

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,160
whether it's a financial support whether

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,960
it's management support

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,320
whether it's and when i say financial or

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:43,360
management you know i'm really talking

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:45,120
about money

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,560
so now that you've found the opportunity

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,880
what does that mean for you

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,720
i really don't like how this is i'm

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,880
sorry let me try and fix this i'm trying

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,440
to do a bigger screen

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,560
oh here we go now that you found the

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,160
opportunity

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,520
you want to uh review it very carefully

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,840
you're going to want to read the

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,680
directions and i know

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,759
let me back up by saying i know some of

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,440
these things may be very very obvious to

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,039
some of you

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,400
and and i can appreciate that but these

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,320
are

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,160
points that are continually missed in

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,800
every single evaluation

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,560
every single response that i've seen for

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,000
some reason it's not as straightforward

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,639
as it might sound

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,759
so this is i'm hoping to give you a

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,120
step-by-step guide

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:34,240
for how to successfully

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,720
submit a positive application so number

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,560
one

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,560
you want to review the opportunity and

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,479
that means reading the directions

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,000
for the community engagement challenge

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,080
we specifically said

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,039
you know right around here we are

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,440
looking for

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,880
x y and z so we tell you exactly what

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,400
we're looking for

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,160
you also want to make sure you're aware

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,199
of the goals of

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,840
the opportunity what are they trying to

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,039
achieve

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,639
by putting out this opportunity so again

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,479
for the community engagement challenge

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,720
we said what are the goals of this

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,120
opportunity and then we answered it

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,960
once you review the whole thing you want

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,400
to make sure you understand the rules

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,720
this is sometimes called the terms and

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,960
conditions partly you want to do this

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,560
to make sure that you are eligible to

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,520
participate

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,360
so in some cases there are limitations

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,479
for how old you can be

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,840
whether you're a student or a

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,039
non-student whether you're working or

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,960
you're not working

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,240
sometimes there are limitations on your

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,080
team size

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,440
you know can you have as large of a team

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,560
as you want is it

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,120
a two-member team a three-member team um

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,479
and then sometimes there are uh country

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,680
restrictions you have to be from a

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,479
certain area

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,080
or uh you know submissions from other

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,680
areas might not be accepted

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,520
so you want to make sure that you have

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,120
reviewed this and understand it

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,039
and that you are eligible for the

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,400
opportunity because it would be horrible

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,360
to go through the whole thing and then

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,960
realize

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,639
oh no i can't i can't participate

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,520
one suggestion would be to read the

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:04,479
frequently asked questions or the faqs

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,880
here the organizers have anticipated

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,560
where

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,720
things might need to be explained a

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,400
little bit more and anticipated what

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,319
your questions might be

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,440
and so some of your answers could

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,840
probably be found

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,680
in this section

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,080
so now you've decided okay this is a

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,400
great opportunity and i'm going to apply

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,400
for it

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,080
what i suggest is that you create a plan

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,560
make a checklist

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,400
of all the required documentation and

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,919
deadlines to make sure you avoid

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,479
any easy mistakes i also like to

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,720
actually

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,520
make a list of all the questions so i

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,560
know

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,560
as i'm filling out the application

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,240
what i need to respond to and how i need

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,440
to respond to it

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,639
now number four i know may seem so

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,599
obvious

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,120
but absolutely make sure you follow the

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,199
directions

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,120
some opportunities require you to fill

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,560
out a pre-application before you can

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,599
submit your

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,560
um your response others ask you to send

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,319
an email

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,639
saying hey i'm interested in applying

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,240
please expect a response from me

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,720
and then others don't ask for anything

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,080
at all so just make sure you check that

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,759
you don't have to do anything

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:22,240
before submitting your final application

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,520
i also want to emphasize the second

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,919
bullet

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,720
if a question has a character or word

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,319
limit

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,160
please make sure you stay under the

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,800
limit there's a reason

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,200
why the organizers have put a limitation

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,440
on

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,479
your response and it's generally because

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,080
they want to see

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:43,599
if you can present your your opportunity

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,640
or your response in a succinct manner

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,080
in some cases um the boxes that you're

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,320
filling out

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,680
may limit how many characters or words

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,399
you can put in there

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,800
and in other cases it might not so

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,640
you'll need to be aware of it yourself

00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,839
i would say about half of the

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,760
applications

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,680
so of 150 were received for the

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,519
community engagement challenge

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:11,600
25 no about

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:14,160
40 of them went over the word limit

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,440
for some for some organized

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,839
organizations

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,519
this might uh invalidate your

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,080
application immediately

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,399
for others they may just cut you off at

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,080
the word count or the character count

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,160
we were a little bit more flexible and

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,320
loud and allowed all the applications

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,399
to come through but not everybody would

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,240
do that

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,760
the other thing to be aware of is to

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,800
make sure that you submit your

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,480
opportunity

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,920
in the language that they are requesting

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,880
you submitted in

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,680
for us our judges are primarily english

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,920
speakers

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,680
and so we ask that all applications be

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,360
sent in in english

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,120
here's an example of one application

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,839
that we received

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,680
not in english unfortunately i wasn't

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,560
able to translate it and it's not really

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,480
my responsibility to translate it

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,720
but unfortunately we were not able to

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,800
accept this application

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,399
i will tell you though that we did give

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,440
the opportunity for this person to

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,519
resubmit

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,560
um however they chose not to at least i

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,560
think they did since they never

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,880
responded

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,079
we received some other applications that

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,320
were all in english

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,839
and then had two sections that were in a

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,519
different language

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,120
i believe this person probably cut and

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,600
pasted their response in

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,720
and then forgot to translate so if

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,120
you're going to do

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,120
um your response in your native language

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,120
which is totally fine

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,480
please make sure that you translate all

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,720
of the sections course

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,720
before submitting your final response

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,440
so you've decided to apply you're in the

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,279
process of completing the application

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,079
i've already given you some hints but

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,079
here are some more

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,120
you want your application to tell a

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,640
story and in doing so you want to create

00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:01,120
a roadmap for your judges and when i say

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,160
telling the story i mean having a sort

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,079
of a start

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,680
a middle and an end by

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,000
putting your questions on a separate

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,519
document as you're filling this out

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,440
by looking at all the questions together

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,040
it'll help you craft your story a little

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,279
bit more

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,000
that being said you want to make sure

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:25,040
you're answering your questions directly

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,800
so you want to make it easy for the

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,800
judges to find your answers

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,079
you don't want to have them dig around

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,000
for your response

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,360
and that's partly what the roadmap is

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,320
for so

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,640
you want to avoid responses like please

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,839
see

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,399
question 3 for my response or answer

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,839
above

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,600
or answer below if the judges and the

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,640
organizers are asking you

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,519
for repeat information there is a reason

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,839
for that

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,839
and you don't want to have your judges

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,399
going back and forth back and forth

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,440
trying to dig for your answers if

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,560
they're going through

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,279
hundreds of applications they just will

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,839
not spend the time doing that

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,680
you also want to avoid inserting links

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,320
without an explanation

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,160
so something like check out and then a

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,839
particular website

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,320
you know some some judges and organizers

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,360
may click on it and dig in dig into it a

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,519
little bit

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,560
but others may not have the time it may

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:27,680
not want to spend the time on it and so

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,079
you'll want to put in an explanation

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,680
for why you're including this web link

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,000
you could say something like

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,120
to see the history of our project please

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,320
click here

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,720
or to avoid inundating you with all of

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,200
our

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,240
fantastic images we've uploaded them to

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,480
this website

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,320
please click here and that way at the

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,639
very least the judges know what they're

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,120
looking for

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,160
you also absolutely want to customize

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,720
your answers

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,240
to the goals or mission so one of the

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,600
responses we got

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,320
was i to this challenge of engaging

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,639
beginning coders of the frost community

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,680
i wish to increase the egg supply of my

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,800
village

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:13,920
well you know what that's totally fine

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,920
that's a perfectly acceptable um

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,160
response to this challenge if

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,880
the individual had said you know by

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,880
teaching

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,160
the children in my community about free

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,519
and open software

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,760
or by creating a program to uh

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,720
you know count eggs so that we can then

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,480
anticipate

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,000
where our increases and decreases might

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,120
be however

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,600
they did not customize their answers to

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,680
the goals and missions of the challenge

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,279
this is particularly important if you're

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,839
cutting and pasting

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,160
uh your responses from other challenges

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,079
or other grants that you're applying for

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,320
you absolutely want to make sure that

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:55,360
you edit your response enough

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,839
to fit the to fit the

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,519
opportunity that you're applying for you

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,760
also want to make sure

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,760
that you change any names that you might

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,399
have you know if you say i'm so excited

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,320
to apply for the genome foundation

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,320
community engagement challenge

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,079
and then you cut and paste that response

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,199
and you apply for a grant

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,720
from you know another organization you

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,760
absolutely want to make sure that you

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:23,360
change the name the proper names in your

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,560
and your response when crafting your

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,720
story

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:31,199
it helps to ans ask the question why

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,519
why am i including this why would the

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:36,720
judges feel that this is important

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:39,120
why do i feel that this is important

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,360
in responding to the question why it

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,199
will create a stronger application

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:48,160
for evaluation it's also helpful

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,800
to reuse words in the question both to

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,480
guide

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,760
the evaluators um that your answer is

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,320
now coming up

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,000
but also to help organize your thoughts

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,120
so example for example

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,880
one question we had how did your entry

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,800
introduce the foss community to

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,600
beginning coders

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,079
a strong answer would start with my

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,519
entry

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,440
introduces the boss community to

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,000
beginning coders by

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,519
and then you would list why why it would

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,760
it focuses your answers

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,800
it also focuses the judge's attentions

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,000
to that section

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,399
of your response now

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,079
without a leading question like this i

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,880
might have to read through your entire

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:31,440
paragraph trying to figure out where and

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,920
how are they answering this question

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,040
something like this makes it much easier

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,759
to evaluate

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,759
your response

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:44,240
so the evaluation is complete excuse me

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,440
your your submission is complete and now

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,440
it's time to submit it

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,560
the very first thing i want to encourage

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,800
you to do is spell

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,759
check if you have written it in a

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,440
different language

00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,920
you're going to want to translate it and

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,320
then spell check in the language that

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,199
you'll be submitting the application in

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,600
or your response

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,720
in you also want to make sure your

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,880
grammar checking it

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,279
especially if you've done a translation

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,720
of some sort

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:16,000
now i've put number nine proof you read

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,600
your final submission

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,920
after spelling and grammar checks

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,040
because i think it's much easier

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,320
to ask someone to evaluate and proofread

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,560
your final submission

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,240
before you submit it once it's been

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,959
spell checked in grammar check

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,560
so it's helpful to have a second set of

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,959
eyes whether it's a colleague

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,639
or a friend or a family member member

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,920
help review the submission

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,040
so that they can point out any holes

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,839
that you might have

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,720
or help catch any spelling or grammar

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,480
errors that might appear

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,160
you want to make sure that you submit

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,839
your required documentation in the

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,800
requested format

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,680
and this is why that checklist is

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,000
helpful

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,199
that checklist will help you go through

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,120
and say okay

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,399
they want a pdf or they want it to be in

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,880
free working software

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,000
or i needed to upload it to gitlab or i

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,559
need to upload to

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,079
a dropbox of some sort or there may be a

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,760
file size limit

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,839
you'll want to make sure that you move

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,640
those requirements because again

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:19,120
there's a reason why those parameters

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,079
have been put in place

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,360
and i know this is the top ten list but

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,240
i also wanted to

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:29,120
i included this eleventh one because you

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,440
wanna make sure you meet the deadline

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,320
if there's a deadline you need to allow

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,880
plenty of time

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,240
to enter your submission it's not the

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,960
organizer's fault

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,320
nor is it their their responsibility if

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,400
your system crashes

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,559
you can't find your login you haven't

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,320
downloaded the correct programs

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,840
you lose internet connection and all

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,880
that sort of stuff so

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,679
make sure that you save enough time in

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,240
order to

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,840
anticipate anything that might come up

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,679
for the community engagement challenge

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,960
we actually had someone say you know

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,559
they were sick that day

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,919
and they couldn't they couldn't send

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,200
their submission and could they send it

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,080
in late

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,440
so you there are other things that come

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,720
up that you just can't anticipate so

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,760
you'll want to make sure that you leave

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,960
enough time

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,880
to upload your submission

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,400
one thing that i suggest is before you

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,799
do a final upload

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,799
before you even start inputting anything

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,520
you want to save your answers

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,440
again you never know if you know you're

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,799
gonna lose connection halfway through

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,880
you never know if you're gonna have to

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,360
go back and refer to something

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,600
and you'll want to have a record of what

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,760
you responded

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,919
if for whatever reason you need to ask

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,960
for an extension

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,160
always always ask before the deadline i

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,760
don't encourage you that you've asked

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,320
for it but if you have to ask

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,120
ask for the deadline if you ask after

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:56,400
the deadline

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:59,280
i guarantee the answer will likely be no

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,960
but wait what if i have some questions

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,640
along the way

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:08,000
now we've kind of walked through how to

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:10,559
complete a response to an opportunity

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,160
but there are other aspects of

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,559
responding to an opportunity

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,440
that i didn't cover one of them is what

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,520
happens if you have

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:21,360
questions along the way well number one

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,960
go ahead and ask but make sure you

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,360
consolidate your questions

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,360
don't it the judge it don't inundate the

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:31,280
judges or the organizers

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,280
i've given you an example over here

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:37,600
of my email all of the blues

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,120
are from one participant one person who

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,280
is asking me questions

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:46,320
this was over a maybe 45 minute period

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:49,440
and every single email was one

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,039
one question separate questions um

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,440
you know i asked you can you please put

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,600
your questions all in one email

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,720
they weren't they didn't do that so you

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,440
want to make sure

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,200
that you consolidate your questions to

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,520
avoid inundating the judges or the

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,400
organizers

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,880
you also do not want to ask for a

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,840
personal review of your proposal

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,200
so for example we have provided this is

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,880
one of the questions we got

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,200
we have provided three alternatives for

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,840
submissions please note let us know

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,559
which would suit the guidelines of the

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,120
challenge

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,320
if you're asking an organizer or a judge

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,440
that question

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,440
it means you don't know and the judges

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,600
of the organizers are not in the goal

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,440
to let you know that is something that

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,400
you need to figure out

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,080
what i would suggest is phrasing the

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,559
questions in a general way

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,400
to avoid the appearance of favoritism

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,320
now if i had responded to this

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,840
email and said well i think you should

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,640
do option one

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,240
or option three looks like the best bet

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,679
that would be giving that team an

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,559
unfair advantage however if you wanted

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,919
to

00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:02,559
ask a question say

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:05,039
can the judges provide feedback on

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,640
opportunities that would best fit the

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:11,280
challenge

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,960
and have it be general to the community

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,960
then you'll have the opportunity for the

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,080
organizers or the judges to say

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,039
yes we can do that or no we can't

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,400
and then you can go in and ask well we

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,600
provided the alternatives which one

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,080
should we do

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,080
but you've at least opened the door to

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,760
asking whether you can do this or not

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,919
without asking the judges or the

00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,679
organizers to

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,679
favor your application in some way

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,559
here are four few more hits for

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,159
responding to grant's response

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,400
proposals and oh there's a common the

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,520
same rfps

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,520
if there are q a sessions or forums or

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,480
opportunities to ask questions

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,840
i encourage you to attend other teams

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,520
might be asking questions that you

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,760
haven't thought of

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,720
however if you attend you don't want to

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,960
dominate or monopolize the conversation

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,640
my personal belief and this is just mine

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,960
and it doesn't apply to anybody else

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,679
my personal belief is when i attend

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,200
these sessions

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,480
i actually actively try not to ask any

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,880
questions

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,120
if there's something that is relevant

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,720
and extremely important to the success

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,600
of my application

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,559
sure i'll ask it but otherwise i'm just

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,320
there to observe

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,559
it's listed and to see what all the

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,559
other questions are

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,679
as i mentioned in the previous slide

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,320
frame your questions

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,280
generally don't ask individual project

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,480
questions

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,640
the organizers and the judges will have

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,200
a hard time answering

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,039
individual project questions because

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,240
they do not want to favor one project

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,039
over another

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,919
but generally framed questions are most

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:54,000
likely always welcome

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,440
make it easy for the judges to find your

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,600
responses

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,120
so as you're filling out the application

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,840
don't get caught up in your story

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:05,520
that you lose sight of the question

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:08,400
answer the question specifically

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,880
and i encourage you not to put in a lot

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,640
of

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,960
sort of fluff or extra information

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,400
that's not relevant to that specific

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,520
question

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,600
most opportunities will give you

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,039
an additional section at the end or

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,840
somewhere in the application

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:25,679
that says what have we not asked you

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,159
that you want to share with us

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,000
or what additional information would you

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,080
like to share with us

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,919
many times there is not a word or

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,720
character limit for the section

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,520
and this is the opportunity for you to

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,840
add in

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,200
every single other piece of information

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,360
that might have been missing before

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,640
if the organizers or judges ask you a

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,360
question

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,799
answer if they ask it via email make

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,039
sure you respond

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:55,200
you don't want to ignore their emails or

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,600
request for additional information

00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,080
and let me tell you there were a number

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,320
of proposals that we received

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,760
that we sent a question back or asked

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,039
for something uh some point of

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,039
clarification

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,080
and we did not receive any response at

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,640
all

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,600
uh the example that i gave you the one

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,200
that was not

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,440
in english that we needed to be

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,840
translated never responded

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,840
so they missed out on the opportunity

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:27,600
one sort of uh just suggestion but

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,880
obviously not a requirement stay engaged

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,440
follow the opportunity on social media

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,360
send a tweet retweet follow all that if

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,200
you're on social media

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,559
um you know and if you're not that's

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,039
okay too but

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,000
the more engaged you are the more hints

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,240
you will pick up

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,360
or what type of application and an

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,960
opportunity

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:52,080
are responsive that they're looking for

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,960
a big don't though is don't make fun of

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,919
the opportunity

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,880
in a public forum remember twitter is

00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,559
public

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:03,120
uh other social media places are public

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:07,600
as well even telegram and

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:10,080
rocket chat public forums make sure you

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,720
you're asking them for something you're

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,720
asking

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,640
the organizers for money or advice

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,840
or something like that you don't want to

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,320
make fun of them

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,120
in a place where they might see it let

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,880
me tell you

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,960
that has happened during the challenge

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:29,840
as well it does not leave

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,840
a good impression

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:37,440
so to summarize you find the opportunity

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,760
you review the opportunity you

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,600
understand the rules

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,360
one suggestion is to read the frequently

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,120
asked questions

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,880
once you've decided the opportunity is

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,520
going to be right for your project

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,400
you want to create a plan follow the

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,640
directions

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,840
and then do what they ask and then tell

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,760
your story

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,520
but make sure you answer your questions

00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,000
directly

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,360
helpful hints are to make a checklist of

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,159
the required documents

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,240
and deadlines to avoid using mistakes

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:09,440
and make sure you answer the question

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,000
why why is this important why am i

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,000
including this

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,159
once the submission is ready to go

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,760
you'll want to spell check it

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:22,799
grammar check it proofread the document

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:26,320
have a second person read the document

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:29,840
submit all required documentation and

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,480
make your deadline before you submit

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,200
though

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,200
you'll want to save your answers and if

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:39,840
you need to ask for an extension

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,840
ask before the deadline

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,559
