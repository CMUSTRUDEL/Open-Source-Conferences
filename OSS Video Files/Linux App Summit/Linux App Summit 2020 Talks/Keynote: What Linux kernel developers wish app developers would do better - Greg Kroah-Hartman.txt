Description: 
	About this talk:

In this talk, a Linux kernel developer gets to complain how his normal "test case" i.e. userspace code, could do better when it comes to a whole range of different things that have been learned over time by maintaining a stable interface to the kernel for 20+ years.

About Greg:

Greg Kroah-Hartman is a Fellow at the Linux Foundation. He is currently responsible for the stable Linux kernel releases, and is a maintainer of the USB, TTY, and driver core subsystems in the kernel as well as other portions of the kernel codebase that he wishes he could forget about.
