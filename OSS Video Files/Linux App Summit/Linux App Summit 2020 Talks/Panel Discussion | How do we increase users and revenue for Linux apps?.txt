00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,760
ourselves i

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,039
thought we'd start off with some quick

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,480
intros

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:51,039
so um i will ask the panelists to each

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,320
quickly tell us your name where you're

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,879
currently based

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,480
what open source projects you belong to

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,440
or how you're affiliated with open

00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,760
source

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,600
and a highlight from this pandemic

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,000
sometimes we focus on the bad stuff so

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,520
let's

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,519
think about something good that came out

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,280
of it um

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:12,400
let's see annika can you please go first

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,400
sure hi everyone my name is anika and

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,000
i'm working for kde right now as a

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,560
marketing consultant

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,040
and i think this pandemic has helped us

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,560
a lot

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,400
right now we are having this virtual

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,240
session and i think

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,400
before we would have never thought about

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,560
it we might have traveled and i think

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,799
this has made a little bit of things

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,799
easier for us

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,240
awesome thanks i'll just go down the way

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:41,840
that the photos are

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:41,840
organized so cassidy you're up next

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:53,520
let's see yeah hand waving all right

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,640
perhaps you can test um or

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,479
it's okay don't worry about it as you

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,680
figure out your audio settings

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,240
um maybe oh there you go perfect

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,759
okay yeah so there's this leaf audio

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,239
button in the middle i

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:13,760
that's really not smart design anyway

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:16,879
sorry i'm just and just just

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,599
yeah it all works for me uh i live in

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,959
berlin

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:24,239
um i'm well maybe so my all-time

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,920
kd contributor quite a while ago mostly

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,920
helping in the marketing team and later

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,640
also contributed to opensuse

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,760
i currently head up marketing at next

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,040
cloud

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,959
and for us quran has been i guess less

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,040
disruptive there for most companies so

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,959
we already worked from home

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,959
and i think the highlight is a bit that

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,360
we really helped a lot of companies and

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,319
i'm guessing also a lot of private home

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,800
users to

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,680
to work from home to work remotely of

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,120
course while

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,280
you know protecting their privacy

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,000
security and all that um

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,519
so people also care more about it now i

00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,519
guess they're more aware of

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,680
like you know if you suddenly have all

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,680
your stuff or you have to work remote

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,599
then people care more about

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,959
how safe the data is which i think is a

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,280
bit of a plus

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,760
given privacy you know being under

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,879
threat so

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,040
yeah great thank you and

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,720
i just will introduce myself too just so

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,200
that everybody knows who i

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,000
am my name is noritzi and i'm based in

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,120
california

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,760
in the san francisco bay area and i

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,040
first got introduced to open source

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,080
really through gnome

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,120
and my work with endless

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,560
and now i'm working on a lot of um more

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,159
like cross

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,840
open source initiatives um for example

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,360
the chaos project where we're trying to

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,040
develop open source

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,080
metrics and a highlight from my pandemic

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,280
is also kind of the

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,080
connection um my sister who has been

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,239
based in

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,080
los angeles was able to come up and work

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,840
from the bay area and so it was so nice

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,200
to see her for a few months

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,080
um really enjoyed my little sister

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,360
so uh we are going to dive right into

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,200
these questions

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,680
i love that you know you all are from

00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,720
organizations

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,200
um you know that that very much

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,040
oftentimes you know people will think of

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,880
open source as being a place for

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,519
developers and i think in recent years

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,000
we've

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,360
started to change that terminology into

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,800
more contributors

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,040
and i just noticed that you all have

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,080
great backgrounds or are involved in

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,280
things like marketing

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,320
design business legal the legal aspect

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,240
of things

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,840
and so i wanted to hear a little bit

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,880
more from you about

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,800
um how your backgrounds are contributing

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,759
to the vos projects that you're involved

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,720
with

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,240
how important that is and how it's

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,160
contributing really to the linux

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,960
ecosystems growth

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,000
and then how can we attract more people

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,479
who identify

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,639
you know from backgrounds like yours

00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,840
and i'll open it up to panelists anybody

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,520
who wants to

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,759
start off and if not i'm going to pick

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,759
you

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:13,600
so um so i

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,800
uh boy so the problem is there are too

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,000
many lawyers

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,360
um so uh we

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,039
that's i mean it's a little bit of a

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,880
joke but it's also

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,400
you know it's interesting i got involved

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,000
in all this um

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,560
so when i very first got involved in

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,080
in well when i first got involved open

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,919
source as a phrase was still a few

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,520
months away from being coined

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,240
uh so when i got involved it was free

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,680
software and uh

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,000
we really thought the lawyers were

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,639
really important and

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,400
that uh you should that you needed them

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,400
to help structure how people worked with

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:53,039
each other right the licenses

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:56,000
we thought were really central and um

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,039
you know and and i think uh the good the

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,639
good news for the

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:03,759
community the bad news for me uh

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:07,360
though it's it's been great uh is that

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:10,800
um you know i think we've realized

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,319
that the lawyers are much should play a

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,520
much more background role

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,840
right uh where we

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,840
are there for defense which the gnome

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,120
foundation has needed a couple of times

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,840
uh certainly

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,400
uh but the by and large uh the legal

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,919
tools

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,479
are either mostly already done uh

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,680
or much less relevant than we thought

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,080
right that the other

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,039
community aspects things like marketing

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,800
we did have a

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,280
marketing team briefly in the early

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,680
2000s suffice to say

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,080
uh what y'all are doing now is a lot

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,520
more organized a lot more powerful

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,199
um and you know like that's

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,880
uh i think it's actually really a good

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,160
thing the lawyers are much less of focus

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,880
than they used to be

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,960
so thank you for that insight

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,160
um yeah and i completely agree with you

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,479
i think that um

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,479
katie and gnome's marketing over the

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,400
last few years especially has been given

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,400
more of a focus i'd say

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,919
um so we have some people who are

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,759
involved in that do you want to just

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,960
talk a little bit more about

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,840
some of the challenges that you're

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,840
facing with marketing open source

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,080
or some of the things that you've seen

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,720
that are really positive and you'd like

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,720
to see more of

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,479
i i don't want to budge in because i

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,440
know anika does of course marketing in

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,440
kde

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,240
um but at least from next cloud

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:40,720
perspective i can

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,880
say a few things i mean in the end

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,160
when you're when you're running open

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,680
source project in the end it's a

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,479
software project like any other

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,479
and you have a kind of a battle for the

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,400
hearts and minds of users so to say

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,240
right there are multiple solutions and

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,599
and people have to pick

00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,479
um and plain and simple

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,160
they have to find what you have and they

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,280
have to get the idea that it fits what

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,240
they need

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,840
um so the very basics of marketing which

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,319
is just a communicator product is

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,199
something you you obviously need

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,720
and and beyond that of course you have a

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,879
huge advantage that

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,560
um often you have a big community people

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,080
who talk about the product who tell

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,840
other people about the product

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,840
and i think this is how open source or

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,840
free software in the beginning became

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,120
really popular and this is still i think

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,599
really core

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,240
to how open source communities spread

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:36,000
their software i mean it is for us

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:39,760
but you still need to to go beyond that

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,440
um i am a strong believer

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,600
in a need for

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,519
a commercial push behind open source

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,120
projects

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,200
i think it's very hard to become

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,480
successful without full-time paid people

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,160
and full-time paid people means

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,000
well you got to earn money somewhere you

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,000
can of course rely on donations but that

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,120
only gets you so far

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,680
and that means you need to

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,200
reach people who can pay now obviously

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:11,200
private users can pay bit

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:15,120
but companies tend to you know be a much

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,440
more suitable target and

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,160
yeah i mean how many companies are you

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,080
gonna get

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:25,839
by you know advocacy of private users

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,160
some absolutely you can't ignore that

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,160
but in the end when you talk to you know

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,920
a business person

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,680
it's going to be very hard to convince

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,600
them of an open source

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:41,760
solution without having some

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:44,399
yeah marketing both materials and

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,399
videos everything like the whole range

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,560
this is just necessary

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,440
so i think for an open source project to

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,800
go beyond

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,399
you know one or a few people coding in

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,240
their free time

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,600
and to become something that really

00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,440
influences the world

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,440
and i mean i don't speak for everyone

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,000
but for me that's that's motivation

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,600
right

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,079
i want to make an impact beyond

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,360
i don't know myself if you want to do

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,360
that you need

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,880
yeah you need marketing and you need

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,440
people who write documentation

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,000
and you need basically everything beyond

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,839
the codes

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,839
because just code isn't gonna cut it

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,720
my sense

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,480
definitely okay um and

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,959
i wonder uh i know that um

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,040
any got you know the kde team has

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,720
experienced growth in the marketing team

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,640
can you tell us a little bit more about

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,120
specifically again

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,839
um maybe how kde is approaching

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,839
marketing

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,120
and kind of your plan moving forward for

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,000
it

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,920
i think for me uh i will use myself as

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,560
an example because i am a very newbie

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,600
for

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,600
open source society and for me it was

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,760
very difficult to understand how

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,120
things work so i keep myself as an

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,640
example if you're

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,560
approaching a person who's not a linux

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,120
user how are you going to actually

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,000
ask them to join uh this linux desktop

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,200
environment

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,200
so i think uh now we are as you know i

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,079
got in touch with you also we are trying

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,240
to

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,320
reach out more of the local communities

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,399
how are they going to help us reach out

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,560
to more users because you know

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,720
uh for open source like you can't just

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,000
have a simple kind of marketing it's not

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,000
just that you can just

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,440
you know have promotions over the social

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,680
media that will be enough

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,120
that is not because you need a snowball

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,399
technique you know people who can

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,880
actually reference

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,320
uh one another so the best thing is

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,160
which i think a lot of

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,600
communities have already done ambassador

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,000
programs and

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,680
reference programs some for some it was

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,279
successful for some it was not

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,200
and for kde that's why we are starting

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,399
the kde network program hopefully we'll

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,519
be able to rule out

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,120
uh in a few months and our pilot study

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,000
will start from india

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,639
and the whole idea is to start from one

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,880
user

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,240
and who can actually bring on more news

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,440
more users on board

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,440
so that's the whole idea

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,320
well i completely agree with you i think

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,519
um

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,560
when i first started at gnome i also

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,360
um tried to start a group in san

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,680
francisco

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,040
specifically um and and had a lot of

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,680
women interested

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,079
in joining from backgrounds actually

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,720
like

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,200
lawyers who wanted to get out of law and

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,279
um

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,560
you know people who maybe had taken a

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,839
break in their career

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,560
and wanted to um start learning how to

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,800
program

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,959
and thought that open source would be a

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,639
great way to do that

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,399
and when i tried to explain what gnome

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,519
was i was you know

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,160
new to the community too i didn't have

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,160
great

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,320
stories and people were kind of like

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,680
okay i don't totally get why this

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,399
matters or like what i'm doing and so i

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,160
think that we

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,800
you know we have already improved our

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,320
stories but storytelling is so important

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,120
in this and we have to find

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,880
new ways to reach audiences that are

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,600
totally new to this space and so may

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,760
need

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,519
more understanding of why it matters and

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,240
how to do it and rewards

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,560
um companies do that as well so kind of

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,040
along with that you know thinking about

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,959
um you know linux desktop technology is

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,839
not necessarily the hot new tech that

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,760
everybody wants to jump into

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,680
and paired with like you know we have to

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,120
find innovative ways

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,399
have you engaged in any uh innovative

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,800
ways to reach

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,000
new users or you know know of others

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,480
that you think what

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,600
our communities should try um and i'm

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,839
thinking of you clarissa

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,000
i know that you mentioned that you're um

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,920
you know starting a program around this

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,240
uh maybe you can lead off and others can

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,880
join

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,560
yeah i totally can relate with you about

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,720
um

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,120
trying to explain why why do we

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,760
contribute to open source to people who

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,120
are not

00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,120
like uh they don't live that day by day

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,480
so it's very hard to explain that for

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,279
them

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,560
i'm not very good at um i don't know

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,760
making

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,240
sort of a marketing and

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,600
and spreading the love of open source

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,560
for people so it was

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,040
really hard for me to to explain them

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,880
that

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:23,920
like so yeah

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:27,199
we are running this this initiative

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,279
that we we want people to getting

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,120
engaged in open source especially from

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,120
brazil because

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,199
we have lots of people there like the

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,480
population of brazil is

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:40,880
giants but we don't have uh

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,399
many people involved with open source so

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,519
we wanted to reach

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,240
a brazilian community like we wanted to

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,639
grow the

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,720
brazilian community in open source and

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,000
give them autonomy to contribute to

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,279
whichever

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,320
open source uh software they wanted to

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,199
but first we had to talk to like to to

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,680
tell them what

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,440
open source is and why should they

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,800
contribute to open source

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,920
so it was a very big challenge

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:13,600
but in the end they they got it and

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,279
most of them are getting engaged and i

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,880
think the most important thing

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:22,160
that i we did for them

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,959
is was to tell them that

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,160
they are needed you know that their work

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,000
matters

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:33,360
and we need more people to to

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,680
to take part on that and that every work

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,079
that

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,120
even though they are beginners uh even

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,680
though

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,800
they are going to different fields like

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,279
marketing or

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:48,000
usability they they they can get

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,800
they have something to offer to any

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,160
community

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:55,519
because everyone has the capability of

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:58,079
doing anything that they

00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,639
i don't know everyone has skills to to

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:03,680
offer to the community so

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:08,320
and adding to the other question i think

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:09,839
uh um especially talking about usability

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,480
i had no background

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,360
on usability i was like the opposite

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,920
that

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,160
uh we expect i i am a software

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,360
engineering student so i was all

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,839
like developing stuff and coding

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,120
but i saw an opportunity of learning

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,680
usability by

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,279
doing usability tests for gnome and i

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,639
had no background on

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:36,560
design or usability or stuff like that

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:39,759
and i was able to just like being

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,639
like i was a user for gnome

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,639
um like i used you know for many years

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,360
before i started contributing

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,600
and just by being an user i was able to

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,959
contribute to usability testing

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:56,000
like like an user like a beginner

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:58,079
so yeah i think anyone should

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,720
try to to learn a little bit about

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:04,160
usability and run usability

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,880
tests so anyways

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,679
has the skills to to do it you just

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,400
gotta

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,400
search for your oreo field

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,160
sorry i thought i was unmuting myself

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,720
and i muted myself um i was just going

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,439
to say

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,720
yes i i completely agree and i love that

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,039
idea that you know

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,839
you might have skills or superpowers

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,799
that you

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,000
didn't even realize you know and just by

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,760
being in an open source

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,240
community or being exposed to this you

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,679
might say hey i can contribute

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,520
in this way that i didn't think was

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,240
possible and you can start

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,960
you know a whole other side that you

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,000
never knew

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,480
was possible so um that's great and

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,039
cassidy i know that um you know you're

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,160
also

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,919
involved in um interesting ways to reach

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,960
new users elementary has had some really

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,360
great success

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,480
do you have anything to add here and if

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,039
not we'll just kind of

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:06,799
move on yeah absolutely um

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:08,640
really to attract new users especially

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,919
you really need to focus on the

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,120
experience

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,600
in creating the best product period

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,480
um people don't use software because

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,240
it's open source

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,520
at least the vast majority of people on

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,720
earth don't use

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,480
software because it's open source um

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,799
you compete with that proprietary

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,880
software by making a better experience

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,520
and by competing in areas in which the

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,720
proprietary software can't compete

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,720
which is for example privacy you can

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,240
never have a truly privacy respecting

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,160
piece of software if it's closed source

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,200
or if it's proprietary

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,400
so we need to lean into that and

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,080
focus on you know creating the best

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,280
experience you can and focus on

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,280
competing in ways that

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,840
you just you just can't compete with the

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,840
alternatives

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,480
yeah i think people are plus wanting you

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,400
totally agree

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,960
um cool so i um

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,000
one of the questions that i have is

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,520
around

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,320
um collaboration so you know

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,039
we're all doing our best to create you

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,720
know

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,240
great experiences i think that there's a

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,960
lot of opportunity for

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,880
again other backgrounds to get involved

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,200
product managers to come on in

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,320
and other and you know ux specialists

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,200
etc

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,480
um but you know as we think about

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,400
increasing

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,679
um the the users around the linux app

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,080
ecosystem

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,640
um where do you see opportunities for

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,720
communities to collaborate

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,880
and then what do you think is something

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,160
that individual projects really need to

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,010
take on them

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,200
by themselves

00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,760
[Music]

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,080
if i may speak a little bit from a kind

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,120
of outside perspective um

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,720
because we as next cloud i mean we are

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,160
all people from the kde and gnome

00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,679
community in the company or at least a

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,280
lot of us are

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,360
as well as from other open source

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,240
communities

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,799
but of course now we're a third-party

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,640
project

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,280
and and one of the things we do is we

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:15,679
build an app uh the desktop client

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:19,200
also mobile clients and um

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:21,600
you know if you want to grow

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,120
an app ecosystem i mean there's there's

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,120
a pool and a push

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,880
you know like there's there's a benefit

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,080
of building an app for an app developer

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,880
which is

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,720
in simple terms reaching people and

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,320
there's a cost which is how hard it

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,960
is to make an app available for the

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,840
platform and make it work everywhere

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,440
and if i get to complain a tiny little

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,919
bit

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,520
you know there is of course still issues

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,840
with standards

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,200
i like in our case notifications and

00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,200
system tray

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,360
like gnomon kd developed the standard

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,520
for system tray but it's not supported

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:59,039
by gnome as far as i know

00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:01,039
so our app which uses a system tray

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,039
doesn't really work in a logical way for

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:06,880
a lot of gnome users

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:10,080
and and that kind of issues i mean i get

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,320
uh that the desktops and and uh

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,320
well those who built the echo the

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,240
platform so to say they want to innovate

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,280
you want to move forward

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,919
um you don't want to be held back

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,559
perhaps with legacy things but that does

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,480
mean you lose independent app developers

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,720
and you got to really balance that in a

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,960
smarter way

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,480
and work with others in this regard

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,120
because this

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,000
this increases the costs and you know we

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,200
all know

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
that the user base of linux desktop

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,880
isn't great

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,240
isn't huge uh luckily i think there is

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,320
some exciting moment

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,159
momentum i have a couple of small pc

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,760
vendors that seem to be growing and

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,520
becoming more prominent

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,039
and there are the bigger ones dell in

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,880
lenovo of course

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,799
i really kudos to the people who made

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,799
that happen i don't know who

00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,840
deserves the credit but they really

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,280
deserve a

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,960
few pets on the back um because that

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,720
that really makes makes a sizable

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,440
difference i mean when i got involved in

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,200
open source getting a laptop to work

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,720
i mean i wrote blogs about it because it

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,120
was weeks of work

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,720
and now you can just buy one from dell

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,559
and lenova which are

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,799
you know huge companies so that's that's

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:25,039
really helpful i think

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:28,080
um but yeah for this

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,720
you have to offer a consistent single

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,159
platform

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,080
yeah having a single website

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,080
like if you want to develop for apple

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,679
you know you go to apple.com

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,120
developer or developer.apple.com

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,000
wherever they put it but there's one

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,360
place where you can get

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,200
started you know um and microsoft the

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,720
same story although they have i think

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,200
600 different

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,799
ui toolkits and everything but still

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,080
there is one way

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:55,200
you can do it and on linux um there's a

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,200
way for now

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,360
but that ad will not be smooth on kde

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,919
and the other way around

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,960
um that's that's not good and that

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,760
should be fixed

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,480
i think because you're splintering a

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,600
platform

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,640
that is already tiny even further

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,960
i mean from a business point of view

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,679
any investment we do in the next support

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,640
is already

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,240
quite a stretch you know as you then

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,840
also have to do it for

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:26,240
two three four desktops

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,159
only crazy people do it we're crazy

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,559
luckily but you know most companies are

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,159
not

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,480
and they don't and yeah if you go beyond

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,720
that

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,640
i mean i know we've done a lot with

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,720
things like um

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,640
you know flat pack and all these things

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,760
and that helps but they're also not

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,480
there yet um you can't do browser

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,799
integration

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,000
uh file manager integration for example

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,159
from a flat pack

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,240
yeah so if you get the the flat pack or

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,360
the snap or or the app image from next

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,440
cloud

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,360
you don't get this nice right click menu

00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,640
in your file manager

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,400
yeah that's and we can't really fix that

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,000
you know that's just a technical

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,000
limitation so there's also technical

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:11,360
barriers that i mean again

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,200
yeah that should get

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,159
more attention i think from the people

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,159
who built the platform

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,159
yeah please jump in um you can unmute

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,960
yourself and just go

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,679
all right so yeah i have thoughts on

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,279
this as well

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:30,559
um i think growth of the

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:34,240
linux platform in and of itself might be

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,240
a red herring um

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,360
you know we could port the whole world

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,520
to linux we could have android apps and

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,240
electron apps and ios apps and windows

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,880
apps and

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,679
we could grow the linux platform in that

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,640
way

00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,120
but to have sustainable growth i think

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,200
you need to

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:56,320
actually have a platform and linux

00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:00,799
is not a platform and

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:02,159
um which is fine like linux is

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,000
you know there's this open source

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,440
ecosystem there's this linux ecosystem

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,039
linux desktop ecosystem

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,640
but there's the gnome platform and

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,760
there's the kde platform and there's the

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,200
elementary platform

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:15,279
etc and we can all have similar and

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,360
overlapping ideas and goals and opinions

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,440
and go about things different ways

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,279
but really i think to make a good

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,279
experience for both users and developers

00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,840
you have to focus on growing

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,360
an actual platform i know that's hard to

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,039
hear because it also means

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,120
like you said kind of splintering the

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:35,039
linux ecosystem

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,440
further um but unless we say all right

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,000
let's

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,760
you know let's kde gnome elementals i'll

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
join forces make one distribution one

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,000
toolkit one platform which i don't think

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,320
is going to happen anytime soon

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,080
um i think we really have to focus on

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,600
those individual platforms as separate

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,799
platforms

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,120
again we can still we can still work

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,480
together on things when it makes sense

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,919
but

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,159
i don't know if it's realistic or

00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:01,840
worthwhile to say um

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:03,440
i want an app for linux and

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,679
because that's so broad that that can

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,799
mean so many different form factors and

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,039
platforms

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,159
um whereas if you say i want an app for

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,760
kde

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,679
that's a that's a much better target you

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,679
know i want an app for elementary os

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,400
that's a much more simple target

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,440
um and for cross-platform apps they can

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,279
say i want an app

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,480
for kde and an app for elementor os and

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,360
an app for gnome and those are three

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,240
different apps on three different

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,240
platforms

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,760
just like a windows app is different

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,440
from a mac os app is different from an

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,760
android app is different from an ios app

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,480
so i don't know that it's realistic in

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,919
for the

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,799
foreseeable future to say a linux app is

00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,679
a singular

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:45,120
app that works the exact same everywhere

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,120
and i think we have to be okay with that

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,520
yeah but you can't justify spending time

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,360
on it

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,039
already you know with like a three

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:59,600
percent market share

00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:01,840
um if you then cut that in four

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,520
it's even harder like like what person

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,640
in the business can go to the boss and

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:10,559
say hey we can sell four percent more

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,400
if i uh if we do x amount of work

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,480
like this this is a conversation that

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,799
happens if you want third-party apps

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,960
i'm sure you know elementary and gnomon

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,320
kd can all build a new image viewer for

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,080
themselves

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,840
fine but let's be honest that's not

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,360
going to be helpful in day-to-day work a

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,919
lot

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,240
you also need more specialized apps and

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,720
if they

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,399
have to rewrite the app or at least do a

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,080
lot of work to target each of the

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,760
platforms then a lot of platforms aren't

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,200
going to get targeted

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,880
you know i mean you've seen this with

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,760
ubuntu i mean

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,240
most third-party applications think of

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,440
steam

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,679
they just say we support ubuntu if you

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,320
get it running on fedora and opensuse

00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,960
good for you but we don't support it

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,919
goodbye

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,440
have a good day this because they just

00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:03,039
target the biggest

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:05,039
and that's reasonably sensible i think

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,600
from a business point of view you can

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:10,080
say well we don't care about that

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,520
all right then you know there aren't

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,679
going to be a lot of apps for you

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,679
and your users can then complain about

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,000
that but well that's because you

00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,120
didn't want to build a platform that

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,080
works

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,080
perhaps developers

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:32,480
okay any uh final thoughts on this topic

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:35,840
you know we can go on for

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,520
yeah we can go on for a long time

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,919
we can literally go on for decades on

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,240
this topic yes

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,159
i do want to point out that it's

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,960
something i said in chat that i think is

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,120
probably worth

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,880
for for some of the viewers who aren't

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,159
paying attention to chat

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:55,279
um that um

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:58,000
you know there's some tension between uh

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,360
cassidy saying know nobody uses this

00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,919
stuff because it's open they use it

00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,320
because it's

00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,679
you know high quality or whatever and

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,279
josh saying

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,559
uh only crazy people do this and then

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,320
pointing out that there are in fact

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,679
crazy people who do this right and the

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,720
motivation for those people

00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:17,840
is almost always uh

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,679
about it being free open you know

00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,000
privacy protecting et cetera right like

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,640
there

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,720
are um you know if you i think if you

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,960
look at the history of this movement

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,960
um you know yes of course many of us

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,120
care and to reach a broad market

00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,080
right uh you know i don't think

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,320
cassidy's wrong

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,919
right to reach more than the four

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,200
percent of the market or three percent

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,279
of the market or whatever

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,039
you do need to have a story that is

00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,120
bigger than

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,320
hey you can you can open it up and see

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,600
what's inside

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,559
but at the same time i i

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,720
think it's it's a valuable tool that

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:56,000
free and open source

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,559
desktops have that uh

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,320
you know apple and microsoft don't is

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:03,440
this ideological motivation

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:06,799
right and so what do you

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,640
um how do you i've been trying to stay

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,720
away from crazy because

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,000
has all kinds of connotations but like

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,679
how do you

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,679
how do you cultivate and tend to

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,919
that group of people who do believe in

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,240
this ideological motivation

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,919
how do you grow that as sort of a

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,039
sub-community within the larger

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,320
community

00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:31,600
because that's a potent powerful

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:34,080
intelligent caring group of people

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,760
uh that i think sometimes when we you

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,399
know we've had this pendulum about like

00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,640
are we pragmatic are we ideological

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,880
like you know how do we make sure that

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,640
we're keeping some of those core values

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,679
there because they do motivate people

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,200
and they do

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,880
you know it's really helpful to have

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,960
some people doing things for irrational

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,520
reasons if everybody's doing it just for

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,559
like

00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,320
the cold saying you know and and and

00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,000
here i am at a vc-backed company right

00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,840
so i'm like trying to do things for cold

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,200
insane and reasonable reasons

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:06,559
but like also you know that

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,320
that that additional push of i really

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,679
think it's the right thing to do

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,760
helps get some people out of bed in the

00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,600
morning you know and helps and

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,320
if that helps people put in an extra

00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,320
hour of marketing or coding or whatever

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,559
um that can be really powerful that adds

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,679
up over time and and so i would urge

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,399
everybody

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,279
uh watching this to make sure you do

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,240
have to have the

00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:29,919
the cold pragmatic view but like also

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,440
figure out ways to nurture

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,880
and guard that ideological strand

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,880
right it doesn't necessarily have to be

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,000
the core of what we do but it does have

00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,240
to be

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,039
uh it can be real and powerful if we

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,039
take it seriously

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,279
yeah thank you for that lewis um and

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,360
that kind of

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,320
leads into one of the questions that the

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,120
audience has

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,320
asked which is more oriented around

00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,440
monetization

00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:00,559
um but it's about you know how how

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:03,360
should we start to monetize um

00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,480
and still respect open source and

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,480
privacy

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,240
um there are things like you know

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,200
advertisements donations

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,840
in-app purchases etc that can happen but

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,200
how can we

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:18,320
move towards this while still upholding

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,320
our foss values

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,720
so there's nothing inherently

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,720
inherent about free notebook and social

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,080
source software that means you can't pay

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,279
for it right

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:37,440
um the

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,559
there and there's also this myth um

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,000
daniel for a

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,679
founder of elementary says there's myth

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,200
that open source software is all written

00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,559
by benevolent volunteers and that

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,159
funding the development of software

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,399
somehow corrupts it

00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,519
um that's something we see a lot within

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:53,440
the really die hard

00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,880
linux kind of places on the internet i

00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,799
guess

00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,640
and i think we need to get over that uh

00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:01,760
we need to get over that

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,600
uh money somehow corrupts

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,600
open source software or that you can't

00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,120
ask for money and we need to be not

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,640
we need to not be afraid to build the

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,880
tools

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,840
to allow users to give open source

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,760
projects money

00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,440
um right now that's i think one of the

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,799
biggest barriers is that

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,559
you go to an app store on your phone and

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,080
you pay money for an app you pay a

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,799
dollar or whatever or you sign up for a

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,720
subscription

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,320
and it's really easy and simple but

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,480
there's no way to do that on the desktop

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,840
at least broadly right now you know with

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,760
elementary app center we've started in

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,240
that direction but gnome software and kd

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,600
discover

00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,120
as far as i know there's no way just to

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,720
go click a button and pay a dollar

00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,240
so i think we really need to focus on on

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,200
those pieces of building the tools to

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,120
allow people to

00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,240
to give open source projects money and i

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,320
don't think that is

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,279
in conflict whatsoever with the free and

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,279
open source values

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,399
okay um so you know talking about ways

00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,519
that we can

00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:03,039
um monetize and create rewards

00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,640
for you know um the development to

00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,799
continue the creation of apps to

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,720
continue and then also

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,800
you know for sustainability i'm

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,800
wondering what uh

00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,720
what are you all you know using for

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,760
yourselves and what are some ways that

00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,960
we can continue

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,040
to make

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,320
the application of or sorry the

00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,119
development of applications more

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,879
sustainable

00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,399
you know some of you you know like lewis

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:30,320
are involved directly in

00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:32,079
helping um the foss ecosystem be more

00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,520
sustainable so can you tell us a little

00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,079
bit more about that and

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,079
your thoughts

00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,079
yeah sure i mean let me give the sort of

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,599
basic

00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:47,040
tide lift elevator pitch which is

00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:50,000
that uh but it's focused on libraries

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,119
right so like our basic observation is

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,240
that

00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,159
all big uh companies are

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,480
now software companies and all software

00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:01,920
companies are open source companies

00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,440
and so you know literally a trillion

00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,480
dollar industry

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,480
built on top of open source uh

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,359
and yet at the same time piles of this

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:14,160
open source that these companies rely on

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,920
uh becomes unmaintained every year

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,119
because people aren't paid directly to

00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,680
work on it

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,160
and so they get a new job or they get a

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,320
puppy

00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,480
or they get a toddler and all of a

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,000
sudden this side project becomes much

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,720
less important

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,480
and uh then the side when the side

00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,119
project becomes important it

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,160
eventually gains security problems it's

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:39,119
just as important to new apis etc etc

00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,800
etc i think everybody here understands

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:44,160
that basic cycle

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,920
so our observation um

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,680
inspired in part by red hat which my

00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,079
other co-founders are all uh

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,720
x red hat people i'm technically x red

00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,359
hat but i

00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,079
spent more time at souza than i did it

00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,839
uh ever

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:59,280
at um the the observation was if we can

00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:02,000
measure this

00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,960
we can capture what people are doing uh

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,119
and pay out

00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,480
based on that it's almost you know for

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,359
those of you who are familiar with like

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,839
spotify

00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:11,599
and how they pay artists similar to that

00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:14,320
the the intuition is

00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,359
we capture what you're actually using uh

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,520
we measure that

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,800
and we redistribute the money you've

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,920
paid us

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,359
to developers who uh whose software is

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,720
being used

00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:27,280
and we do that based on we do that based

00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,119
on

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,640
essentially i mean the the short version

00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,200
of it is analysis of your package

00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:36,240
manager metadata

00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,839
and uh oh and we require the developers

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,880
to do basic stuff around security

00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:41,359
licensing all that

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,960
basically the enterprisy stuff that is

00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:45,040
sort of boring that is not something

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,160
you'd want to do on a saturday morning

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,800
for fun um and you know we turn that

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,400
into

00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,960
a revenue stream the challenge for this

00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,200
audience

00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,640
unfortunately is that we just don't see

00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,200
enough usage of

00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,440
free software at the application layer

00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:04,720
and we don't have a way to track it

00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,200
right and so our model at least as of

00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,240
yet

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,599
doesn't really allow us to say for

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,720
example

00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:15,280
um you know are you using

00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,560
the firefox web browser which is free

00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,320
versus the chrome

00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:23,440
web chrome browser which is free and

00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:27,119
you know donate revenue based on uh

00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:30,560
you know based on that usage right and

00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,400
so it's a tough uh you know and

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,440
especially for organizations that are

00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,920
still primarily

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,839
at the desktop level there there

00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,680
everybody's an open source software

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,359
organization at this point but that's

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,839
all on the back end right

00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,800
that's not what developers are using in

00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:47,119
their day-to-day

00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,640
primarily it's not what the business

00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,680
people in the organization are using

00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,480
day-to-day

00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,160
and so extending that pitch up the stack

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,079
um

00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,000
we would love to do it at some point but

00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,880
we don't see you know quite where it

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,960
fits

00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,480
uh yet in our model which is really

00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,920
unfortunate because

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,520
you know several of us one of my other

00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,640
co-founders is havoc pennington

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:11,240
who some of you may recognize from

00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,400
uh you know this digital docs on

00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,760
freedesktop.org

00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:18,960
uh you may have seen his name in uh

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,400
you know those kinds of things um yeah

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,119
so it's a hard fit

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,680
right i do wonder you know having also

00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:28,960
worked at mozilla and at wikipedia

00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:32,760
i do have to i do always wonder

00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:35,040
whether or not some of that more

00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,400
user-focused as opposed to you know at

00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,079
the end of the day our tide lifts

00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,839
business is very enterprise focused

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,240
right we are here to

00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:43,200
get dollars from very big enterprise

00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,520
companies

00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,560
and turn that into money for developers

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,760
i do wonder

00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:52,640
you know wikipedia certainly to a

00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,000
great success mozilla to less but still

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,320
not zero success

00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,079
has turned their user bases their human

00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,040
user bases not their enterprise user

00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,359
bases

00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,680
uh into revenue streams and i do wonder

00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:07,440
if that's a more fruitful path

00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,839
for uh you know for these communities

00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:15,839
here

00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:18,000
right for ganon kde

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,280
yeah anybody else on thoughts i know

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,359
cassidy you've

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,800
uh elementary has the app store so jump

00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:26,400
in

00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,000
yeah so uh especially the tide lift

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,599
model is really interesting and i've

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,880
always been really fascinated by that

00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,320
um on the the desktop i think it's

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,680
really interesting because i don't i

00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,119
don't want to take all of the underlying

00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,240
work that goes into

00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,720
the desktop for granted but there are

00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,920
very

00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,119
very large successful companies who are

00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,640
very invested

00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:51,920
in maintaining and improving the

00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,599
linux plumbing in general so i think uh

00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,079
it's important not to get bogged down

00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,280
in you know how can we ensure that every

00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,079
purchase of this app

00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,839
written by a starving developer uh also

00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,359
goes and pays for the linux kernel

00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:05,119
because those are all those are very two

00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,960
very different um

00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,319
developers or development you know

00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,520
people uh

00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:14,800
in very different situations

00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,400
and i think as as the ecosystem grows

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,920
uh there will be opportunities to

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,760
reinvest revenue

00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,280
once we actually have revenue for these

00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,640
apps

00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,160
there will be opportunities to reinvest

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,680
that into the ecosystem to make sure

00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,839
that our interests as

00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,240
you know platforms for apps are well

00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,440
represented within the linux desktop

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,599
but i don't think we can pretend it's

00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,800
equivalent to say you know for a one

00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,680
dollar app from somebody who's just

00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,560
trying to make rent

00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,240
this month um that you need to make sure

00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,720
that whatever percentage of the linux

00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,800
kernel

00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,240
gets funded and whichever percentage of

00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,839
glib gets funded

00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,359
from that one purchase of that one

00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:51,440
dollar app from somebody who's

00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:51,440
otherwise not making any money um

00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:01,599
i i i sorry louis please go first

00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:02,480
uh yeah i just was a real quick point

00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,160
which is that

00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,319
you know the only reason we believe that

00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,560
that kind of trickled down

00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:09,920
uh works in the server space is because

00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,560
there's a lot of money in the server

00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,200
space completely agree with cassidy that

00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,599
that on the desktop space taking a small

00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,319
pie and subdividing it into even smaller

00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,480
slices

00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:22,000
is is a very tough sell i mean it's

00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,520
tough enough in the server space and

00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,760
and it would be very hard in the desktop

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,760
space

00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:34,000
yeah except i basically am completely on

00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,560
board with cassidy and louise

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,319
on this it's this is gonna be quite hard

00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:42,000
on the desktop on the other hand

00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:44,800
um a part of it is that the pi

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,680
is small and there's a lot of money in

00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,200
the server

00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,319
okay but if the pi were bigger as in if

00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,400
there was more use

00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,680
obviously there would also be simply

00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,720
more money

00:41:53,680 --> 00:42:00,880
now i again i'm biased

00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:03,839
at next cloud we have internally

00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,800
tried looked at over the years various

00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:08,160
business models

00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:11,520
and we really do not believe

00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:13,680
that there is much

00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,720
room for earning money on private users

00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,880
there are a lot

00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,880
of private users of nexcloud like really

00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,079
a lot there are about three to four

00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,760
hundred thousand nexval

00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,240
servers on the internet so people

00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:27,040
running an excel server

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,880
um and that's obviously the vast

00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,560
majority of that is just private people

00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,119
running it on on an old desktop or

00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:37,280
raspberry pi or vps somewhere

00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:39,119
and we try to do a lot to make the life

00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,200
easier to make it easy to update

00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,319
to make it easy to find it download it

00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,680
run it

00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:47,760
and we do not do anything to try to

00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,839
monetize that we really try

00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,040
any idea that comes up internally that

00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:53,280
boils down to

00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,119
make money on private use we say ah

00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,800
let's not try that please

00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:01,599
because we think that it is far easier

00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,040
and more effective to try and monetize

00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,640
bigger companies

00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,240
and i think that same can be true for

00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,400
the desktop i mean

00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,920
if big companies they also need the

00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,480
desktop right and they are currently

00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,280
paying

00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,200
for that that's in the end what it boils

00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,440
down to there is money getting paid for

00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:20,319
for windows and mac os

00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,000
indirectly in case of mac os but still

00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:25,200
um

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,520
and okay then you have a bit of a

00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,560
problem kind of a chicken egg issue

00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,680
i think where um right now there's just

00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,640
no

00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,319
not not enough of a movement there that

00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,760
that you can build a business on it i

00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:40,160
know both red hat

00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,960
and souza tried to to have their you

00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,599
know

00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,119
linux enterprise desktop i think and

00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,240
rather than enterprise linux i guess

00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,480
desktop too

00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,480
uh they both tried this and i think

00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,800
there was definitely some money made

00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,480
but not enough to really sustain it and

00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,520
to really build up

00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,359
a bigger you know pie basically

00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,040
now part of that is probably that you

00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,359
know i guess at some point i'm sure

00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,599
susan went for kd and red hat for gnome

00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:07,280
which is like okay do you have to split

00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:10,640
efforts there but

00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:12,480
right this is i guess um

00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,680
how this works and you can debate for a

00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,839
long time whether

00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,960
that was smart or not and how what that

00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:23,599
did but didn't help i'm sure

00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:26,960
um but then even if you can um

00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:28,480
um back to i think the challenge is the

00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,720
chicken egg here because there just

00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,119
isn't enough critical mass to do this

00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:35,040
now one thing i believe is that there's

00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:38,000
quite a bit of interest from government

00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,480
interestingly in in pushing open source

00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,640
uh

00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,319
for privacy reasons for digital

00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,440
sovereignty reasons which is a fancy

00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:46,160
term that throw around

00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,359
these days which just means controlling

00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,200
your computing

00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:50,480
which is obviously what free software is

00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:53,040
all about when you go

00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,839
back to the basics it's about you the

00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,520
person

00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:57,680
who or organization that runs the

00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,920
software controlling it

00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,680
and that is indeed really important and

00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,520
right now we're in the situation where

00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,200
half the world is running software that

00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:08,640
is developed in

00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:11,599
pretty much one area of the world and

00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:13,599
you know whether that's good or bad

00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,960
there's definitely some inherent risk in

00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,119
that i think

00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,560
and open source is a prime way of fixing

00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:21,280
that problem

00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,319
but of course governments tend to love

00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,839
to

00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:28,960
invest through complicated

00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:31,280
you know grant and all that stuff and

00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,560
i am very skeptical of that i mean it

00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,280
can work i guess

00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,240
but often you know getting money for six

00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,400
months

00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,319
and then it disappears again this is not

00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,359
how you build a sustainable

00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:45,280
open source project so

00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:46,400
a better way would actually be if

00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,599
government would

00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,560
do what it preaches and what you see

00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,079
right now is that

00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,839
governments all over the world are

00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:58,000
putting millions billions

00:45:53,839 --> 00:46:01,280
into proprietary software

00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,160
how about stop doing that

00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,640
and put that money in open source that

00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,040
would

00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,480
definitely in terms of size of the pie

00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,480
completely

00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,000
solve the money problem because there is

00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,560
more than enough money spent

00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,400
in one year just by europe on microsoft

00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,000
office licenses

00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,319
i mean there's more money going into

00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,680
that than i think all of open source

00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:24,640
on the desktop and even the whole stack

00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,000
below it

00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:30,560
spends in the decade so there's money

00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,160
it's just being spent on well it's

00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,079
basically just going to shareholders

00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,680
because of course it's not like

00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,359
microsoft is spending more than one

00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,720
percent of the money that's being paid

00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:40,000
for microsoft office onto the

00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:44,240
development of it

00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:47,119
right this is the the margins are insane

00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,720
uh so i don't know i'm kind of hopeful

00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:49,440
that at some point government will wake

00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,760
up and think

00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,119
huh so right now we're spending i don't

00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,599
know 10 billion a year

00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,400
in just one country on licenses for

00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,880
something that

00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,000
actually could be developed for of a

00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,119
billion

00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,599
in one year or two how about maybe do

00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:06,800
that

00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:09,200
instead um

00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,280
i don't know it's it's it's one thing

00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,440
i'm i'm hoping for i mean after all

00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,319
you know we thought at least i thought

00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,760
for a long time

00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:20,160
that you know no hardware vendor of the

00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,040
size of dell or lenovo is ever gonna

00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,960
ship

00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:28,319
you know uh open source desktop software

00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:30,160
ever and they do today so who knows

00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:32,559
maybe governments will also wake up

00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,559
some day

00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,760
yeah i think that's a really interesting

00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,760
point um

00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,920
you know having worked at endless for a

00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,880
while we did actually approach

00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,800
government organizations and i know that

00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:49,599
there are some governments that have

00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,480
you know started to use more open source

00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,960
or they have

00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,400
budget for open source but at the end of

00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,400
the day you need support

00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,319
for it you need people that are like

00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,240
actively there like doing business

00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,359
development and those relationships take

00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,920
a lot of time

00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:05,920
because government moves really slow and

00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,440
i think that's one of the reasons why i

00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,839
personally feel really

00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,760
um passionate about this topic because i

00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,960
think that it's a great training ground

00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,920
for people who

00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,520
have um business development skills or

00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,240
sales or want to like

00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,119
go into like people who are not thought

00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,440
of as the

00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,040
traditional open source contributor can

00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,079
do so much to help

00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:30,319
um i know uh alberto ruiz had been

00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:31,440
you know really great at helping us find

00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:33,359
opportunities

00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,720
that you know we hadn't thought of at

00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:37,280
gnome and those are

00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,480
incredibly valuable um we need to get

00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,440
more people

00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:43,680
who want to do that who excel in doing

00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,480
that who are very people skill oriented

00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:48,319
to go and form these relationships with

00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:51,680
governments and other

00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:52,240
you know organizations so totally agree

00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,160
with you

00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,520
and then i think that the challenge that

00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:58,559
we have again is around

00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:00,319
service and support because at least in

00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:02,480
my experience that is something that

00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:05,680
governments expect um

00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:08,400
and uh that can be quite

00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,400
quite a lot of work and you know in a

00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,119
volunteer-based organization

00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,359
or mostly volunteer based you know it's

00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:17,359
a little difficult

00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,720
i mean to elaborate on those for to

00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,520
elaborate on that thought a little bit

00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,960
for people

00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,880
in the audience who haven't worked at

00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,839
those kinds of companies it's not just

00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,240
that it's hard

00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:27,599
it's that it's hard to scale right

00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,400
something that we have

00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,880
used to our to our benefit in open

00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,280
source

00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,200
is hey a handful of us write software

00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,760
and it gets used everywhere

00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,680
uh and you know new users does not

00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,520
necessarily mean

00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,280
i mean it does in some cases but it

00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,880
doesn't necessarily mean more burden on

00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,960
the developers

00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,240
more users definitely means more burden

00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,640
on support right

00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,760
and that's where like support contracts

00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,440
and

00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,440
enterprise class support is it's not

00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,040
just that it's hard to do well it's that

00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,079
when you add a new customer you also

00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:01,920
to hire and train and deploy

00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:03,119
a new support person and you the next

00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,119
customer means the next

00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:07,520
you know and that's something that is

00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:09,760
not um

00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,640
to get back to where the conversation

00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,559
started

00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,920
that's something that needs money right

00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:18,160
like that is an eye

00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:19,839
you can't really do that uh support

00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:22,160
uh that kind of support on a volunteer

00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:22,160
basis

00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,960
yeah and then i think this just to

00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,640
combine

00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,160
you know both points that were just

00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:34,240
being made

00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:37,680
um i think there's also a bit of a

00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:40,880
sales pitch slash attitude issue here

00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:42,960
because of course one argument for open

00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,920
source that's used very often is

00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,520
it's cheap or it's free which is a

00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,760
horrible argument if you're trying to

00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:53,680
make a business right this is just

00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:56,720
killing i mean so often our sales team

00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,920
and they're doing amazing work but so

00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,839
often

00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,400
the main argument that the customer

00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:02,960
internally has used to deploy next cloud

00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,000
was

00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:08,480
save money that

00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,720
that that kills any opportunity for us

00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,319
to build a healthy business that way

00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,640
and the problem is of course a lot of

00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:16,000
people who love open source and try to

00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,960
promote it

00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:23,200
will also use this argument which is

00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:24,880
quite awful

00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:27,119
and that that's where somebody mentioned

00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:30,480
in chat uh the public money

00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:32,319
uh public source um

00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,920
argument that fsf europe has been

00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:34,960
deploying a lot lately and i think

00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,000
that's a

00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:41,520
terrific message and goes to your point

00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:45,280
joseph of the european union

00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:47,359
yeah okay and

00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,480
i know we only have a few minutes left

00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:50,160
um i

00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,920
they're i'm not sure this is the best

00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:54,720
suited for this group but

00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,920
um you know it has been identified that

00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,960
we need to have

00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:01,280
more emphasis on you know a

00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,960
place a space beyond the linux app

00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:05,680
summit where we can collaborate

00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,960
all together you know freedesktop.org

00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:10,720
has been named

00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,200
um as and i guess something that we can

00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,559
try

00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:15,359
to amplify or to extend something like

00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:18,880
that

00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:20,400
and um you know do you all have ideas

00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,559
for how we can continue this

00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,200
conversation beyond

00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,200
this space

00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:36,000
or how to keep collaborating

00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,720
yeah i think um honestly i think free

00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,680
desktop

00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:41,680
um it gets a bad rap of you know it's

00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:44,000
not a standard spotty it's not

00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,880
an enforcement agency or anything like

00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
that

00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:51,599
um but there's still a lot of

00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,599
really good stuff there um

00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,440
free desktop existing is why there is

00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:55,920
some amount of intercompatibility

00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,240
between

00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,040
desktops like when you click an icon it

00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:03,520
opens an app

00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:06,319
like fundamental things like that um

00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,640
so i personally i think free desktop is

00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,960
is

00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,680
probably still the best route um i think

00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,200
it needs

00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:14,960
maybe to be revitalized and

00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,800
may be repositioned a little bit as far

00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:20,079
as what its goals are

00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:23,760
and you know how active things are and

00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:25,040
who's involved with those efforts um

00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,280
but yeah having having

00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:30,400
intercompatibility between desktops does

00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,280
does improve things and it lets us all

00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,720
kind of

00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,880
have our own visions for what the

00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:37,200
desktop is

00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:39,280
while not totally wasting resources

00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:41,280
reinventing the wheel every time

00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:44,160
so yeah personally i'm a big fan of the

00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,160
free desktop angle

00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:54,079
okay and i'll step back a second and say

00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:57,599
that there's

00:53:54,079 --> 00:54:01,280
a community at sustainoss.org

00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:04,720
including um a uh including a

00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:07,680
semi-active uh discourse forum

00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:10,800
uh that is a gathering hole for people

00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:12,960
trying to do the money

00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,839
and sustainability and open source

00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,680
discussion

00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:17,680
it's very uh

00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,160
library and developer centric but could

00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:24,000
certainly

00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,599
for folks around here who are interested

00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,440
in the space it's certainly a great

00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:31,280
community of people

00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:33,040
um i s i yes they they were trying to do

00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,640
meetups twice a year actually the last

00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,680
thing i did i think sheree was saying

00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,240
this in chat

00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:40,000
uh the last thing that i did before

00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,880
everything got locked down was go to

00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,200
sustain

00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,960
and uh you know i assume they'll be

00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,599
doing some online stuff as well there's

00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,119
also

00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,559
several people doing podcasts around the

00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:53,359
space that may be interesting for the

00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:55,520
audience here

00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:57,440
yeah i want a second that i actually

00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,880
myself have that on my to-do list to get

00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,760
more involved because i think that

00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:04,400
there's

00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:07,040
a lot of um just great people from both

00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,640
corporations and more traditional or

00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:11,280
just open source projects

00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:12,720
that are working together on this and um

00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:16,240
i think it's a great

00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:17,280
place to get involved i see that you

00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,520
added another

00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,720
link in there louis i don't know the

00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,559
public code.eu

00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,319
is just for those who were the public

00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:25,079
money public code slogan that i

00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:27,920
mentioned

00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:29,680
publiccode.edu is a site uh with

00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,520
materials and discussion of that

00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:33,760
of that slogan i also want to say

00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:37,839
actually and this relates to

00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:41,280
joss's point about free software is

00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:43,920
is low cost i will say actually my one

00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:46,079
concern with the sustain oss community

00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,040
is that often everything is phrased as a

00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,720
donation

00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,640
and there are certain contexts where

00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,799
donations work

00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:54,880
um you know like i mentioned earlier for

00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:58,000
wikipedia donations work

00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:59,920
uh but i actually uh actually my biggest

00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,319
concern with the sustain oss crowd is

00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,920
that

00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:03,599
that the large amount of corporate

00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:06,640
participation

00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:07,680
uh for the corporate folks they never

00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,760
want to buy anything

00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,960
they always want to donate and there's a

00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,520
reason for that

00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,720
and that's because uh they can turn off

00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,319
donations whenever

00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:18,240
they can feel good about donations

00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:19,440
without actually building a sustainable

00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:22,240
community

00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,599
and um i think that's a message that we

00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:27,119
all need to push back on

00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:30,240
right that this is i suppose

00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:30,880
yeah but you know i mean taxes is yeah i

00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,559
mean it's

00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,079
but it's not quite taxes it's like

00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:37,359
voluntary it's like

00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:40,240
oh look there's a saying in the

00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:41,200
u.s uh nonprofit world of oh i gave at

00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,680
the office

00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,880
right it's like this idea that you you

00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,319
donated once

00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,799
and so now you don't have to think about

00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:50,640
it again right and you'll see this

00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:52,480
there are a couple big companies in the

00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,720
sustained ecosystem

00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,839
uh or the sustained community who have

00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,640
made these big

00:56:55,839 --> 00:57:00,640
public pronouncements of oh we donate

00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,160
ten thousand dollars a month to one open

00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,400
source project

00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,760
and like and guess what ten thousand

00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,799
dollars once

00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:11,599
is not sustainability right that is a

00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:12,880
that is that that makes you feel better

00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:13,520
but it doesn't actually help that

00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,480
community

00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:18,240
yeah it's not bad for that community but

00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,799
there's also not much money

00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:22,799
i mean we we get companies that reach

00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:24,960
out to us sometimes like yeah yeah

00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:27,520
you know yeah we like maxwell we want to

00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,359
support it you know we have a donation

00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:31,200
and then we sent them a quote and the

00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:33,839
quote is easily a hundred times what

00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:36,079
they were even considering to donate

00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:38,160
and i'm like yeah but like our engineers

00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:40,400
get a normal salary they don't

00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:42,160
get like five percent because they

00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:45,520
happen to do open source

00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:48,799
okay i can't charge you 5k a year

00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:51,119
when you would pay 500k a year

00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,480
for a solution from a proprietary

00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:55,040
company why

00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,559
are we even having this conversation and

00:57:55,040 --> 00:58:00,079
this is

00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:02,000
yeah this is not helpful and

00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:03,680
yeah it's in part to me to change the

00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,839
conversation i mean companies have made

00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:08,880
progress here i think a lot of companies

00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:11,599
and governments they used to consider uh

00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,280
free software like freeware and they had

00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:14,799
a rule against freeware

00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,520
and then they killed and they said no

00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:20,400
open source okay that time is luckily

00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:23,440
passed we're in 2020 this was 25

00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:25,440
or something um and then

00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,920
they used it but they saw it still as

00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,680
like free you know it doesn't cost money

00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,280
and this is something we still need to

00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,200
get rid of and then we need to teach

00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:35,440
them by the way that when you run

00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:37,040
open source software you should get a

00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,480
support contract

00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,319
and then we're gonna have to teach them

00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:42,799
you should get a support contract

00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:44,799
with the people who built the software

00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:46,559
not some random third-party company on

00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:48,400
the internet that just happens to know

00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:50,319
how to configure the software

00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,520
once but can't actually help you when

00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:53,839
something breaks

00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:55,440
like all these things are also a matter

00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:58,880
of communicating

00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:02,319
and teaching um big companies and

00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:04,559
governments to understand um

00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:05,920
you know how open source business works

00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,960
and honestly

00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:10,720
once 80 of the fortune 500s

00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,240
has an internal policy that when they

00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:14,559
use open source to get a support

00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:16,400
contract with the vendor

00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:18,000
i think running an outsourced business

00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,240
even for desktop software will

00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,839
become a whole lot easier because

00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:25,280
suddenly you can

00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:27,920
just say look i make this application

00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,079
be it a krita you know like a drawing

00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,799
application or just a desktop

00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:34,240
and you know there's an internal policy

00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:36,559
if you use it

00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,520
and rely on it you want to have a

00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:40,960
contract

00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:42,960
excellent we offer that contract and

00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:44,799
for the server side this is what lewis

00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,559
is kind of doing of course offering this

00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:49,599
from what i understand

00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:52,240
um for the desktop yeah

00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:53,680
we need to teach a lot still really a

00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:57,040
lot

00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,520
yeah all right well i'm sorry to do this

00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,359
but

00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:01,520
we're out of time so we're going to have

00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:04,960
to continue this conversation

01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:06,640
in the hallway or um you know i

01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,000
have seen some people post that they're

01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:10,079
going or promise they're going to have

01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,559
blog posts coming out sometimes so keep

01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:13,599
an eye

01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:14,400
out for those thank you so much for

01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:17,440

01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,920
in the chat so if you haven't had a

01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:22,240
chance to look at that

01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:24,319
please do and i'm sure there will be a

01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:26,160
lot of follow-up also exploring the free

01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:27,359
desktop option that we've mentioned a

01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:30,160
couple of times

01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:30,720
