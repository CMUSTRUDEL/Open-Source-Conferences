Title: A technical introduction to MyGNUHealth and the GNU Health Federation ecosystem - Luis Falcon
Publication date: 2020-11-15
Playlist: Linux App Summit 2020 Talks
Description: 
	GNU Health is social project that uses Libre technology to improve the health care system around the world.

In this talk, I'll be talking about the GNU Health Federation ecosystem and MyGNUHealth, the mobile and desktop application. We will talk about the technical components (KDE, Qt, Kirigami, Python... ) and how we can deploy MyGNUHealth in every desktop computer, as well as in mobile devices, such as the PinePhone.

I will go into details about the communication mechanism across the participating nodes in the Federation, the role of the GH message server (Thalamus) and the security aspects.

Finally, we'll dedicate sometime to the functionality of the main components and nodes, from Personal Health Records (PHR), to social medicine, bioinformatics, epidemiology, medical genetics, personalized medicine and cancer research.

hello everybody good morning to you and

00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,559
good afternoon wherever you are

00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,599
um today we're going to be talking about

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,200
mike new health

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:17,760
it's a lively

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:21,279
project uh for a personal health record

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:25,039
and it's part of the guinea health

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:28,080
ecosystem just to go through

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,599
the agenda very quickly we'll go through

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,719
the history

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,640
of the project and then we'll talk about

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,800
the components

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,559
and finally we'll dive into the uh

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,840
the application itself the mobile

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,399
application

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,960
and and this is a bit more technical the

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,640
others

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,320
than others but uh not too techy anyway

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,239
so i think that everybody would be able

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,640
to to follow it

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,360
and hopefully i think that we have until

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,559
uh

00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,280
9 15 9 20

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,000
so we'll get some time for the questions

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,000
if there are any

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,159
just a little bit about myself my

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,920
background

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,520
academic background and professional

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,520
background it's a

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,960
computer scientist and a medical doctor

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,880
and basically i've been specialized in

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,600
genomics and medical genetics

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,080
but the things that move me the most are

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,119
social

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,560
medicine animal rights

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:36,560
you might hear my dogs between the the

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,759
talk calling me for a walk

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,079
and of course libra software and

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,960
it's it's a it's a great combination to

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,079
work

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,560
in the three of them in this sort of

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,560
projects

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,680
so um this picture was one of the very

00:01:52,320 --> 00:02:00,640
first one that we

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:03,680
took in argentina this is 2006

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,880
and it was the initial or the kickoff

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,600
of the new health project we were

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,520
working

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:14,720
initially in rural schools

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,360
and then i felt that

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,160
these kids needed more than just

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,120
technology

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,680
and and that's where the primary care

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,400
concepts and the

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,160
public health and all these

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,160
socioeconomic determinants of

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:35,440
of health came into light and

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,840
a couple of years later new health was a

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,840
reality

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:47,920
so new health is

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:52,800
a project from solidario nu solidario is

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:56,560
an ngo that works on social media

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,519
and we have a global we're small ngo but

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,560
we work

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,440
globally we have projects in all

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,560
continents today

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:11,920
and it's also a new uh

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,920
official project since 2011.

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:23,360
these are just some very

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,239
quick summary of different projects

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,640
around the world

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:32,400
from laos jamaica argentina mexico

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:35,200
india and we work with multilateral

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,480
organizations like the united nations

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:42,879
university or the

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,879
world health health organization

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,159
so what's what's taking us today

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,519
it's again um my new health and and as i

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,640
said at the beginning

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,000
it's part of a larger project called new

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,120
health

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,799
these are some of the components

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,280
technical components that we use in our

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,560
project

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,680
all of them of course are libra software

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:17,120
and from operating systems

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:20,160
as open source or freebsd

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:24,560
database we use different

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:28,240
like postgres sql or tinydb python as a

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:31,759
main programming language

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,800
cute tritone flask and the documentation

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,720
today is on

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:40,479
wikibooks we use vue.js for the

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:45,440
federation portal and gnupg mainly for

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,440
signing documents and encrypt documents

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:53,759
so new health as i said it's it's it's a

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:57,120
it's an ecosystem it's it's a set

00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:01,440
of programs that do different tasks

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,600
okay so we have a health

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,080
hospital information management system

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,759
we have a laboratory

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:13,840
we have we'll be talking today

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:17,600
personal health record application

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:20,240
we also work on the areas of

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,560
precision medicine and bioinformatics

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,919
and genomics

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,800
and also we have the embedded solutions

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,479
so you can

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,520
run new health on single board devices

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:38,320
like raspberry pi or karas

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,560
or olimex

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,240
so from all of those components we have

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,360
this screenshot is

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,560
a set of of

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,880
different scenarios within the

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,160
hospital management information system

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,600
component or node

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,680
i i call them nodes

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,600
so you see that you can do diagnostic

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:04,960
imaging

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,960
have your agenda work on histopathology

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:12,800
you have uh charts for epidemiology

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,039
or growth charts in pediatrics and so on

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,960
and basically you can run your your

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,520
health institution your hospital your

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,680
primary care center or your private

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,680
doctor office or laboratory

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:32,560
so now let's get into the um

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,280
details or or more than details

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,680
an introduction of my new health and why

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,280
did we create this application why are

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,280
we creating this application

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:49,360
the main idea behind my new health

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,639
is putting the person the citizen the

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,720
patient

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:59,680
on the driver's seat right i feel like

00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:03,039
as a physician most of the time

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,720
people or the patients are are more of

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:09,599
like passive actors you know and and

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,280
and they pretty much are supposed to

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,759
take the

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,680
the orders or the recipes or whatever

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,840
the health professionals tell them

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,840
and and that is that's a mistake we have

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,440
to empower the uh

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,000
the um the person to be an active member

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,160
of the system of health

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,280
so um within this new health

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,520
ecosystem my new health uses

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,720
this technology that you're seeing here

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,280
okay so

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,800
as in many other components python is

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,800
the main program in language

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,360
we use again ginupg for uh

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,840
privacy and for signing documents in

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,520
this case we are using tinydb

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,080
as a document document-oriented database

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,879
because remember this is now a

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,199
one-to-one relationship between

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,840
the person and your database this is

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:13,039
this database is not a multi-user db

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,759
this is your db it's going to be on your

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,400
desktop or on your mobile device with

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,319
your

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,400
only data um

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,599
then we'll see kirigami that makes it

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,680
convergent

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:31,919
matplotlib for charts

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:35,519
enqueued for all the framework

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,519
of of the

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,039
graphical interface

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,039
we use a plasma mobile

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,480
so python 3 is the main language as i

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:53,200
just said and most of

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:57,600
these components you can find them today

00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:01,440
at the python podcast index pb

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,839
um and again as

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,399
many others okay so you can find

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,720
thalamus or you can find all the stuff

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,839
of

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,880
related to bioinformatics

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,880
and pi by two

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,839
so we are using um

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:27,040
cute uh for um

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:30,160
all the graphical interface

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,839
um by using the pi

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:37,120
side package okay so uh

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,360
basically is the queue for python or pi

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,880
site 2

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:46,240
package that allow us to interact

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,640
with all the cute classes already

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,000
existing

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,880
and it's it's uh rolling up running out

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,880
really really well

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:07,120
now one of the good thing about cued and

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:11,279
kde framework is this a component

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,279
polk origami that allow us to

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,680
make my new health convergent and that

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,959
means

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,360
that it will adapt

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:24,480
to different scenarios so if you are

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,760
running my new health like your desktop

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:31,040
computer you will have your widgets

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:34,160
and your and your ui

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:37,839
adapted to that

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:41,120
desktop computer now with the same code

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:46,160
you will be able to run it

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:51,279
on a mobile device whether it's uh your

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,279
tablet or where is your mobile phone

00:10:53,360 --> 00:11:01,120
so here is a very short example of

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,360
my new help py the very first

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:09,440
or main program and you can see in this

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:13,040
slide how do you actually import uh

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:17,200
those modules uh so you have pi side two

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:20,959
cute widgets qt core and qtqml

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:24,880
we use qml for the design

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:26,079
and the logic is always on on the python

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,120
side

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:32,480
it's a nice way to divide ui

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,839
from from the logic

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,160
and it's it's pure python 3

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,160
code

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:46,160
so this is an example on how

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:50,480
it will actually be seen on

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:55,519
the plasma desktop

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,519
you have two screenshots from different

00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:02,160
context right

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:06,079
and you will be able

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:10,480
now to see in the next slide

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:15,120
how will that actually look um

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,120
on the uh on the mobile devices

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,040
so this is actually a picture the photo

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,200
that i

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:27,360
took um from the

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:30,720
pine from the pine phone uh

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,440
and again you know i i didn't have to

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,800
change

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:38,480
a single line of code thanks to

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:41,519
kirigami framework right it it

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,880
if you see if you see

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:49,360
this slide you will see this

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:53,040
little icon here the typical x

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:56,079
from the x window system right um

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,639
that and of course you have the windows

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,920
frame

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,000
and and so on and then when it comes to

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,519
um

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,240
to the pine phone um all of those frames

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,760
uh

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:14,160
and and icons disappear for the sake of

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:17,839
uh expanding right and and optimizing

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:21,839
the uh the viewing experience and the

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:25,120
in the layout on smaller

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,440
screens and it's it works really really

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,440
nice

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:39,360
now a um words about the storage

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,320
so so one of the things that we need to

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,480
do

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,000
is to be able of course to storage all

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,519
this data if if

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,240
we want to have a chart on my blood

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,519
pressure

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,399
of my blood glucose levels

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,519
i need to be able to retrieve it from

00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:00,079
somewhere

00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:04,320
and of course there are many really good

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:08,959
databases engines both for

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:12,240
regular computers as for smaller

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,639
devices but i also wanted something that

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,959
it was going to

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,959
give give

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,720
facilities to the end user in terms of

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,639
searching for documents

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,399
and be able to make a single single

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,880
backup and take it from your desktop to

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,360
your mobile and vice versa and so on

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,399
and then and that's what i found tiny

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,519
bit i maybe

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:45,440
it's a document oriented database

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:50,320
it's basically a nice way to represent

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,320
json and to store json uh

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,600
objects and um

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,440
and and it's of course platform

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,800
independent that means that if i take

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,920
that dump

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,480
from from by um

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,519
from my desktop i just take the file and

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,959
i can just

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,959
put it on on the

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,480
tablet or on my mobile device and it

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,680
will just work

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,720
fine and that makes it very

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:22,240
portable and so far so good

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,240
it's a really really nice

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:30,560
document oriented database

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:33,279
that for this case where we don't have

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,440
much of concurrency at all it's

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:41,839
basically a single use database

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,839
it's it's working beautifully

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:49,440
so now we've talked about um

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,440
pretty much running my new health my

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,759
personal health record

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,639
on my devices right whether it's my

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:59,360
laptop or my mobile device and so on

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,399
but that is good of course that is great

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,600
but we need to go

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:07,040
one step further and that means we need

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:10,639
to integrate this data

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:14,320
in the system of health so uh

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:16,000
my health professional can see all those

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,360
results

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,800
without me having to go to

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,800
the health institution

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,600
and and especially now with this

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:31,120
pandemic context that comes

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:36,079
very handy because then

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:39,199
you know you can have a

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,680
much a daily

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,360
all your daily activities being

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,759
monitored

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,560
by your health professional and you can

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,360
take action

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,000
or or she or he can take action

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,519
depending

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,199
on the values that you are providing um

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,360
and that's where the new health

00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,639
federation comes into place

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,959
right if you see this slide

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,000
you will see that it has pretty much

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,679
three sections right

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,720
you have a left side with three icons

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:14,319
then in the middle you have thalamus

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:17,600
and then in the right side you have the

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:20,640
new health information system well

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:24,400
the components that you see

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:28,000
on the left hand side those are

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:31,039
the nodes that make up

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,280
the gnu health federation so

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,280
one of the nodes can perfectly be

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,880
a hospital running

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,280
the hospital management information

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:47,200
system node from

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:50,400
excuse me from new health

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,880
the oil can be a laboratory and the oil

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,440
can

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,640
very well be like new health right so

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,080
this could be

00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:01,280
my new health application

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,919
what happened is uh you are going to

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,200
have

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:08,799
the possibility of setting up

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,440
my new health and saying well i want

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,760
to be part of the system of health right

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,000
so you have a network settings i will

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,200
see

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,240
a little bit afterwards where you can

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,000
actually say well

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:25,120
this is where the thalamus server is

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,720
it's located and and

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:31,840
i want to provide my credentials so

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,160
whenever i enter my data that can

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,679
actually sync

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:41,200
or be in sync with the uh

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,559
with this very large database i will

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,559
have on the

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:49,360
political system for example right so

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,880
the thalamus is pretty much a messaging

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,320
authentication server

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,760
that it will allow you to go and

00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:01,520
put data and retrieve data depending

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:04,080
on your uh access rights right

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,640
so basically you have an acl that says

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,840
well

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,559
you can actually providing that that you

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,280
have

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,799
logged in correctly and you can do this

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,919
and this and this

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:19,039
on these entire than that resources

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:22,840
right and

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:26,080
the thalamus is it's pretty much a flask

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,080
application right

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,960
so this is just to show you how you can

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:39,679
couple with the

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:43,440
new health federation

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:47,360
uh from your

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,360
own my new health uh

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:54,160
application right so in this case

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:57,039
you would go to a network settings

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,919
right and then you establish by default

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,840
the

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:05,600
ssl https protocol

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:08,400
and then you put where is that thalamus

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,320
servers in this case we have

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,440
in germany this is the federation

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,120
newhealth.org

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,559
this is a public server that we have set

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,520
up so everybody can

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,960
test their notes and and play around

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:26,240
with the system

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:29,280
um you you put the port

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,640
and then you have your unique federation

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,159
account

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,919
and your password so what is the

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,039
federation account well

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,280
this is something that we've been uh we

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:44,320
actually introduced this concept

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:47,679
uh some years ago already and

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,120
what we need or what we want to achieve

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:53,840
with this

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:56,000
is that no matter where you are

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,080
in your province or in your region on

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,760
your country

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:04,400
your health data is going to be

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,000
up to date so if you are in health

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,480
center eight to the

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,760
today and you go to health center b

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:17,120
tomorrow in another province

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:21,200
uh whoever is going to see your

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:23,760
clinical history is going to be updated

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,720
he or she doesn't have to start from

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,440
zero

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,720
to get all the data from you it will be

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,919
already there

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,960
and that is a huge advantage um because

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,640
believe it or not

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,880
we are still in many places in the world

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,880
and

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:45,840
in many places in within europe

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,840
where different provinces have their own

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,840
local database and they don't talk to

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,120
each other

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:56,240
so if you go from avery to barcelona

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,760
you're going to start from scratch with

00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,520
your medical history and clinical

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,559
history and when that is

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,400
within the public health system where

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:08,240
pretty much we have

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:11,520
um seven minutes per patient

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,840
that takes precious time out of your

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,840
visit

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,480
so once you have this set up all the

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:23,360
data that you put

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,559
and you wish to put because again if if

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,039
if we go here but

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:29,679
if we go back here one second you see

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,679
this sync

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,679
boolean here field basically saying

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,880
i want to be part of the system of

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,960
health okay

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,320
and and if you don't put the thing and

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,520
you of course if you don't

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,919
fill in this data you have your data

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,400
only for you which is perk perfectly

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,400
fine too

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,360
so this is uh again

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,240
a bit of a summary of what i just said

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,919
about the

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:06,000
the benefits of of having

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:10,960
um every person as a node so

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,760
until now the nodes were pretty much

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,600
healthy institutions okay so you have

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,480
many health institutions across your

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,840
country and

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:23,200
yes today we have the ability

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,240
with the new health hospital management

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,799
information system

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,799
to sync all your patients

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,799
evaluation lab clinical diagnostic

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,480
imaging and so on

00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:42,080
but we didn't have a tool that would

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:45,600
make the person a an active

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,400
uh actor right in in the health system

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,039
and that's where

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,080
my new health comes into play and that's

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:54,880
where you now

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,880
as a citizen are a single node

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,360
now all of this is really great

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,440
but if we look at it not only on the

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,760
covet

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,039
pandemics which of course will make a

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,320
huge difference

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:16,240
and it's already making it uh in in

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,240
some countries uh not on my new health

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,480
but at the hospital management

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:24,640
information system

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,640
think about what we can do in

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:32,080
rare diseases in cancer research

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,640
in autoimmune conditions

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:38,799
there are so many things that we can do

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,799
in the fields of precision medicine

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,240
with the new health federation that is

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,320
incredible

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,720
and you can only do this

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,080
if you have this sort of federated

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,120
database

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:56,880
and this federated distribution

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:59,279
um we work

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,640
with the uniprot databases in the unit

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,760
protein

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:08,559
and we have thousands

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:11,600
of natural variants and proteins

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:14,960
or basically mutations

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:18,240
in in genes that

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,960
today we are uncertain of what is the

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,320
clinical significance of many of those

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,600
mutations

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,880
um so some of them we know and

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,000
yes we can say well this is

00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:33,200
non-pathological or yes

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,720
this is a clear clearly

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,960
pathologic mutation so it has a very

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:43,760
important clinical significance

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:46,240
but many many of them we just don't know

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,080
what can happen to us if we carry that

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,559
mutation with us

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:56,960
and by having this sort of

00:25:52,559 --> 00:26:01,760
of infrastructure you can find

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:04,559
or it will help us finding

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,760
a correlation between your genotype and

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:10,240
your phenotype

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:13,840
so what is what are your genes and

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:17,679
what is the expressions of those things

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:20,880
and for those for those

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,880
especially for those

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,840
mutations where we still are natural

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,679
variants that we still

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,120
don't know what is the clinical

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,120
significance and this is

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,159
this would be really really a

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,200
breakthrough and

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:38,880
and and we are

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:41,039
pushing to have uh new health and minor

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,120
health in the in

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,039
in different countries around the world

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,000
of course we already have that

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:50,000
but now that we are in europe we want

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,960
the european community

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,360
to embrace my new health and my new

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,880
health

00:26:53,360 --> 00:27:00,799
federation to tackle

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:04,320
these genetic diseases

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,320
and of course cancer

00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,840
research

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:19,120
and in in argentina for example

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:22,720
the national agency

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:28,159
uh for research

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:34,000
has chosen magnum health to work on

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:37,279
as an observatory for the kobits

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,840
pandemic in the um entry rios uh

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,840
province

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,640
and again this this this possibility or

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,960
this ability of

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:53,200
of the uh my new health excuse me of

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,039
the new health federation to be able to

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:59,279
do real-time

00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:03,919
charting real-time epidemiology

00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:07,279
reports in many cases

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:10,559
will stop an outbreak

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:13,840
to become from becoming

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:16,640
a an epidemic right

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,600
and it would be great to have had this

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,440
in the

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,320
early times of of the covet but anyways

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,840
it's there

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:29,360
and it's it's it's available for

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:32,240
any public health system in the world

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,240
that wants to use it

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:41,919
and we are not just talking about

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:45,520
um infectious diseases

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:48,880
there are so many other diseases

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:52,799
that are not contagious

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:57,600
so we are talking about diabetes

00:28:52,799 --> 00:29:00,080
we are talking about domestic violence

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:03,919
that are as important as contagious

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,919
diseases and we need to tackle them

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,960
in the same matter

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:16,240
so just wrapping up

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,559
some of the things that we are doing

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,679
today and some of the things that we

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:23,039
need to be done and need to be where we

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,799
need to put the focus

00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:28,240
um again as i said currently we have the

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:32,000
uh

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:36,399
the uh mercurial repository uh

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,399
at savannah um

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,799
and the documentation is an on wikibooks

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,240
we are supposed to be

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:48,559
releasing uh a bit a better

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:51,520
version by the end of the year um

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,480
and things that we would like to work on

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:56,320
uh

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,159
of course packaging uh localizations we

00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,919
we've done a pretty good job on

00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,919
localization with the hospital

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,880
management information system

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,279
but today my new health is in english

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,080
only

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:10,080
so we'll have to work a bit on that so

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,520
no matter where you are you will have it

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,760
on your own language

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:17,679
and of course strengthen

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,520
privacy and security making sure that

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,799
everything is in place

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,799
and the difference between my new health

00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,960
and the hospital management information

00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:29,039
system note is that

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,159
my new health is to be run by people

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,720
that are not necessarily

00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,399
technical so everything should be very

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,399
very simple to use

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,720
and as a matter of fact my new house

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:41,520
should be already installed

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,440
in uh for example the pine phone so

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,640
whenever you get the pine phone you will

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,360
have a

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,000
minor health in place that that would be

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,480
that would be

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,360
uh wonderful and if not it should be

00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,960
simple to just download as a regular

00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,399
package

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:04,559
um oh by the way

00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:07,279
we or or at least i work only on

00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,919
libre operating systems and leave the

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:11,919
devices

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:16,240
that's why i have chosen the python

00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,240
as the first

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:21,519
mobile device to to to install or to

00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,519
develop my new health thing

00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:28,159
um i don't work with android

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,480
i don't work with ios i don't work with

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,519
microsoft windows

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:37,039
those are non-libre

00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:39,600
environments and i don't really want to

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:41,760
spend my time on those if anybody wants

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,519
to port my new health to any of those

00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,880
operating systems

00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,880
you are most welcome but

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:54,559
i think that it's it's not part of

00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:57,679
the new health philosophy and

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:59,919
new health is a social project that

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,159
you know that uses technology but mainly

00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:04,480
is a social project and i think that

00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,279
anything that is non-liberty goes

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,200
against

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:10,000
the our philosophy of universal health

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,039
care

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,399
and um it's it's it's

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:19,519
uh putting some sort of

00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:22,080
bars in front of people to reach

00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,200
that universality and that freedom in

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,320
healthcare that's why

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:30,240
again i only work with libre

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,240
operating system and environments

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,039
uh i as i said a couple of slides before

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,120
we have

00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:44,480
um a testbed we have a community

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,880
public server in munich where

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,919
anybody can just log in and and play

00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,200
around with it

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:53,120
we have a thalamus installed there and

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,120
we also have

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,880
the hospital management information

00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:00,720
system so you can log on

00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:04,880
create a patient check the

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:07,279
you know the lab test imaging and also

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,519
play with this concept of the federation

00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:12,399
so you can install your own

00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,159
node and start syncing information back

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:17,760
and forth and so on so that

00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:23,919
should be running 24x7 and

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:26,159
it's been there for for quite a bit now

00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,159
and

00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:34,159
next week right by this time

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,159
we will start

00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:41,120
the new health con 2020

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:43,200
uh it will be also online as the one

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,080
that we are doing today at the

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:49,600
linux application summit and you are

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:52,480
most welcome to participate on it and to

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,039
you know get in touch with the community

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,120
and

00:33:53,039 --> 00:34:00,159
see all the guys from cute

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,760
and from the plasma mobile and from the

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:05,120
open source

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:08,720
and so on that will be there

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:11,839
hanging out with us and

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:14,639
giving out a lot of cool information

00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:18,399
that definitely will be

00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,440
in the next upcoming new health and my

00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:22,079
new health

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,599
releases so remember this will be next

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:28,159
friday

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:30,720
november 20 and november 21st

00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,000

welcome to register

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:39,119
right there at www.gnuhealth.org

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,240
and that pretty much makes it for today

00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:49,760
this is just some information i will

00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,440
leave it there for you so if you want to

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,480

to listen to your to your questions and

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,359
comments which of course are very

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:05,040
valuable because at the end of the day

00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:07,839
what you see today it's a 12-year

00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,040
project and 12 years of feedback from

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:12,800
the community

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:16,560
which have given us the success that has

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:18,079
new health today so um yeah we're going

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,440
to have like

00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,560
eight minutes if there are any any

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,599
questions

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,839
yeah thank you luis

00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:30,079
we do have some questions if you would

00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:33,119
like i can uh

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:35,520
i can say them for you great yes

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,480
please listen a few minutes so let's get

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,880
started

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,920
the first question is what challenges

00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,000
does this app

00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:46,560
pose on terms of privacy

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,560
yeah well um actually one of the reasons

00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,320
that we create my new health

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:55,599
is actually to um empower the person

00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,599
and make sure that you are in

00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,000
charge of your own privacy and that's

00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:03,119
why we don't use

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,560
any operating system or any device that

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,200
is non-free because

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,720
you are going to have the source code

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,680
you are going to have

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,200
the possibility of encrypting your data

00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,920
and you are going to pretty much

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,040
be in charge of your own data and if you

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,760
want to

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,400
be part of the new health federation you

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,000
might be

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:27,760
very well welcome but from

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,280
start to end you are in charge of your

00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,560
own privacy that's

00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,800
what it makes it different from other

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,400
personal health records and that's why

00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:41,839
actually one of the main reasons we

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,839
created my new health

00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:49,280
okay the next question we have

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:52,720
is what are the open hardware devices

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,720
you are currently looking at

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,800
so we have um we basically have the pine

00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:03,440
phone on on mobile devices

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:06,960
but then we have uh the um

00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:09,839
kalas and we have olimex as a

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,839
single board

00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,119
devices and we we also have images for

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,240
the raspberry pi

00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:22,320
uh three and four so those

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:24,960
would be the open hardware

00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,760
technology i would say that from all of

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,320
those

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,760
cadas and especially olympics olimex is

00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,720
is really really from

00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:37,839
a to c open hardware it's it's a great

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,839
great device

00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,079
all right the next question we have is

00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,599
regarding privacy

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:47,839
who has access to data on federation and

00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,560
how

00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,520
that the access to the data on the

00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,800
federation

00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,920
it's ruled by the access control list

00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,480
that you have

00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,359
on your federation id that i talked

00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,240
previously

00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:04,240
so if you are a citizen you will have a

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,520
citizen profile if you are a health

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,880
professional you have

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,400
a health professional profile and if you

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,839
are in the ministry of health you will

00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,400
have a ministry of health for

00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:17,520
epidemiology and whatever profile so

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,560
depending on on your profile you will

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,880
have different access

00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,440
control requirements to different

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,440
resources

00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,800
all right luis this is the last question

00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:33,839
we have

00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:37,839
it is how how

00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:37,839
is duplicate data handled

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,079
you shouldn't have any duplicated data

00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,520
because every single message

00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:50,720
has its own uuid it's it's

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,720
it's unique id so

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,560
you can have two different records with

00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,200
the same

00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:02,000
value but those would be different ideas

00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,240
by itself so every node has its own id

00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,800
and

00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,640
every message within the node has its

00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,960
own unique id so

00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:14,400
it's pretty much impossible to have

00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:14,400
