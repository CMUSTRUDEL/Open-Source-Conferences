Publication date: 2020-11-15
Playlist: Linux App Summit 2020 Talks
Description: 
	GNU Health is social project that uses Libre technology to improve the health care system around the world.

In this talk, I'll be talking about the GNU Health Federation ecosystem and MyGNUHealth, the mobile and desktop application. We will talk about the technical components (KDE, Qt, Kirigami, Python... ) and how we can deploy MyGNUHealth in every desktop computer, as well as in mobile devices, such as the PinePhone.

I will go into details about the communication mechanism across the participating nodes in the Federation, the role of the GH message server (Thalamus) and the security aspects.

Finally, we'll dedicate sometime to the functionality of the main components and nodes, from Personal Health Records (PHR), to social medicine, bioinformatics, epidemiology, medical genetics, personalized medicine and cancer research.
