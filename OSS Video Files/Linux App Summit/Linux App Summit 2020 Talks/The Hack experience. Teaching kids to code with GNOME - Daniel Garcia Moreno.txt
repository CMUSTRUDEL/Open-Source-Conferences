hello can you hear me okay

00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,960
yes we can hear you okay so now in

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,440
the virtual stage we have daniel garcia

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,040
moreno and this talk the f experience

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,920
teaching kids to code with

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,920
no so you have 40 minutes

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,680
okay thank you

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,519
hello uh my name is danielle

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,760
moreno and i want to talk

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,760
today about the hack experience

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:43,120
and what we are working on ls

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,480
since some time ago you can find

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,840
you can contact me on this uh

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,239
email if you have any question or

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,239
something

00:00:52,399 --> 00:01:00,960
don't stay down ask me or pick

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,960
me on on the irc or something

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,840
so the main idea behind this project

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,040
is to try to improve their learning

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,479
experience

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,479
for kids the living reading specifically

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:21,600
the learning experience

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,640
of programming or or computer science or

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,840
anything related to the different

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,840
to computers

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,680
so right now we have on on the internet

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,400
we have a lot of documentation

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,880
but you need to find the needle in the

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,799
house

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:44,000
in the hashtag so i mean you can you can

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:47,119
just type on google uh how to

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,320
write code in python for example

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:53,600
and you will have a lot of

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,960
web pages but how did you know

00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:00,640
which one is the the right one

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:04,320
if it is not update if the content

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:08,160
is is correct or if

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,120
if it is something write them for

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,840
someone 10 years ago that is all they

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,879
did or

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:19,599
i don't know you need to find

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,599
the the good content

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:27,360
there is another

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,640
another key problem for for kids to

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:36,959
to learn to code to to to really lean

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,959
learn to go right now there are a lot of

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:44,720
the route of f4 with low level

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:49,360
uh programming with something like

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,280
scratch or that kind of technology

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,800
where you don't see the real code but

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,800
you

00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:00,000
you start to write program with blocks

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:05,280
so this is a good starting point but

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,480
there is it is really hard to go from

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,480
the blocks programming to the real

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:15,920
the real world when you start to write

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,440
real code so there is no an easy

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,800
transition from

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:25,760
from the hc

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,760
tutorial to the real code

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,319
and

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,640
leading is always more fun when it is

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,680
again

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,000
so here we have the gamification

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,000
and

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:46,000
we we know that it is always

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:49,440
easier to learn when it is a game

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,840
so we we can use this to to try to

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,439
improve the learning experience

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:59,360
for kids so

00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:02,560
what is hack hack is a

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,040
project that started some time ago as

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,319
part

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,760
of the ls

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,840
the endless operating system

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,959
and the main idea of this project is to

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,479
try to improve this

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,680
providing high quality learning content

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:25,600
and a full ecosystem to

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,240
to to guide the kids

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,960
or to introduce the kids to this world

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,960
of coding

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:37,360
and try to make it more fun to learn how

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,080
to code

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,720
the the idea behind this project was to

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,639
create

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,600
a first computer for for kids

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,000
but right now this play had changed with

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,160
with time and now we are working on

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,639
trying to provide the hack experience

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,639
everywhere

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,440
i'm not just in a device with the

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:04,160
software and content

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,160
that was the the the first idea

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,800
so in the password

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,960
there was a presentation about hack

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,080
and the break had changed with time so

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,680
we have here some

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,479
some some some change in the

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,840
action of the break in the heart one we

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,639
have the the amenity of

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:35,039
selling the this this computer

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:38,160
with with a custom

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:41,520
operating system with all the content

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,639
and thinking about

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,440
the uh device with all the software

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,720
there

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,840
so we have a lot of control of that

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,680
and we control all the software there we

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,680
can develop

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,680
a really big integration

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:05,280
it was episodic

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,800
so we we release a new content every

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,280
every month and

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,919
you have to follow the github has to

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,960
follow

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,400
the the quest one by one

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,759
and solve the the different

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,880
games and

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,400
there is no the decision to what to

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,680
learn

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:31,039
in the kit for the gig

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,039
everything was guided

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:38,080
and we the hack team create

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,800
the the content and and

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,919
the the idea behind this was to create a

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,919
subscription model

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,080
but after some some things

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:57,280
we started the hack too that is

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,240
we we we changed from the device model

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,960
to a

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,720
software model more more generic

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:08,400
applications so we change to uh

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:12,000
to a application try to

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:16,560
move everything to an application

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,840
we made this available on all

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:23,120
ls so the hack the

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,400
software is on endless by default

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,360
since i think that

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,360
3.7

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,120
so all the content is there

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,560
and the the main thing is that there is

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,680
no

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,280
episodes now all the content

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:47,759
is in the application and the

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:50,639
the kid can can choose what to learn

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,759
what is the most interesting for him and

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,879
try to

00:07:51,759 --> 00:08:01,199
to solve or to to solve some questions

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:05,199
that are organized in different pathways

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:08,479
and we try to to make use of

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:13,280
the existing content instead of creating

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:17,840
all the content by by yourself

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:20,720
so this is the the project

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,280
we will take a look to the different

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,280
components

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,840
we have what we call the group house

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,440
that is the main application it

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:36,479
is this this

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:41,039
is a gtk

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:44,399
application that works um

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:47,360
right now works on almost

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:51,120
every genome this division we are

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,120
working on that i will talk about that

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,080
at the end but it's a gtk application

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,360
with custom styles

00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,839
you can you can see that the the design

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,160
is

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,160
really cool we have

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:11,440
custom characters um

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,519
um all over sound and everything is

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,800
colorful to try to

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:21,040
to adapt it's like a game but

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,720
it's a it's a an application

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,080
and you can see here the different

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,240
character is

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:31,760
each character has a

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,680
defined pathway we have five

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,360
and when you click on a character you

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,399
can see the

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:42,240
list of quest what we got

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:45,120
what we call quest that is basically a

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,120
guided content

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:52,240
so for example

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,560
in this in this

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,080
laptop we have the operating system

00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:04,560
pathway and we have

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:09,360
put into the command line

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,360
so this is it's a gtk application

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,240
um basically is a quest launcher

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:22,560
and has a

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:25,760
has a the the

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,720
we have the the quest system

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,720
inside the clip house

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:36,399
that is the the piece of software that

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,440
integrate the that shows

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,920
the the quest dialogue and

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,000
and make the the content interactive a

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,640
bit interactive

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,240
so the quest guide the user through the

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,600
activity

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,160
giving direction and tips

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,959
and also detects some things on the

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,560
desktop

00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:01,519
if the user opens an application and

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,959
has more more interactive with some

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,279
applications so

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,959
it detects if the user has done

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:12,480
something

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:12,480
and can give tips or continue with the

00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,680
quiz

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,680
and the user can

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:25,600
can select at some points can select

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:28,640
the the next thing to do selecting

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:34,079
from a list of the under request as

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:36,480
to the user actually

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,920
all the questions we have are python

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,000
script

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:45,440
but we have a work in progress

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,360
brand trying to migrate this

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:53,920
or or to support the money specific

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:57,519
language quest to make it easy to write

00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:00,560
quest for for non-developers

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:04,720
so there is a

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:07,519
scribbling language collecting

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,880
and we have some some something to

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,959
integrate these

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,720
with equal system but right now right

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,600
now we have simple

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,600
python script

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,760
that that request

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,079
beside that we have some

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,680
cable applications

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:37,200
we have these

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:42,959
are small applications

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,959
it to to to teach on a specific topic

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,040
so right now in the in the current

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,240
version we

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:54,560
we only have we only are using two

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,720
toyota or one is the side track and the

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,360
other one is the operating system

00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,360
application

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,320
um and these are

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:11,760
these are a simple application that

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:16,800
just are our web application

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,800
inside our webkit container

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:25,279
so this is the content that

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,639
we started to create for the hack one

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,920
and we have

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,320
these applications so we are using the

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,399
hack

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:38,000
to in some quests so it's custom content

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,959
and um

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,560
these applications are designed to to

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:46,839
teach

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:49,519
something specific and

00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,920
then you can write

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,480
more than one quest that use that

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,480
application

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,880
and there are other applications that we

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,880
are not using right now but

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,959
that we can use in the future because

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,760
the applications are working and we can

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,720
integrate

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,600
city with the clubhouse and recover some

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,600
call requests

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:20,079
and then we have

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,399
all of these that i have some are

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:26,160
simple gtk applications for the

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,160
clubhouse statistical application the

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:34,000
applications are the small application

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:38,639
and we have this important piece

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,639
that is the the toolbox

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,440
the

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:51,120
area was to to have

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:55,440
to be able to hack everything

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:58,959
so we every

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:02,079
a cable application has a

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:07,199
toolbox so you can flip this

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:07,199
the application and you will find

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,880
the internals of the application behind

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:16,480
behind it

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:19,120
and there you can find the code

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,320
and the quest can interact with this

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,839
with this toolbox

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,639
directly so the quest can modify the

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:30,240
code

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:33,279
and detect if the user fits the code

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,480
of all all these interactive

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,160
things so you can see here the etc for

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,639
example is a track

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,399
and you can see the the subject toolbox

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,839
that is

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,560
that has different tabs so you can see

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,519
here the

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:55,839
the level instructions that is the

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:55,839
javascript code

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:07,040
so with this we have the flip to hack

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:10,240
concept the

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,000
the at the end the toolbox is another

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,240
gtk application but with

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,240
some you cannot sell

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:23,440
a specific code we we attach that

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:27,040
application with the main application so

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:30,800
we have the effect of the of flipping

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:34,800
and the idea is to to show

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:38,399
to have a to show directly with this

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,440
metaphor of flipping that behind the

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,480
application

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:46,160
you can you can hack

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:49,040
you can modify the code and

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,839
and you will see in real time the

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,040
pressure off

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,040
of your hacking

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:05,120
so this is the little box

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,120
and afterwards could

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:24,480
box um because we have these

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,400
transparent explicit application if you

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,720
change something here in the code you

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:33,840
will

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:33,840
see directly in the game the the same

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,679
so how how can we

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:50,960
do the the flip on all the things

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,280
so to be able to flip the

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,200
the application and to link these

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,240
toolbox with the with the application

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,760
itself

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,640
we need to work on a natural

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,080
modification

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:07,039
at first it was uh select itself

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,520
a specific code in the spreading system

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,000
because

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,000
it was

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:19,760
it was designed to to be a

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:23,360
and less specific content

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:27,760
but we are working to try to

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:30,320
to bring the hack space everywhere so

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,440
we have moved the code to a cell

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,840
extension

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:39,360
but there is a little rain now on

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,679
phone extension.now.org

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,200
and this extension just provide the

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,960
crypto pack

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:50,080
that is uh that just

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:53,280
been some application with the toolbox

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:58,160
and shows the button to clip

00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:01,919
and keeps track or of those windows

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:05,360
so modify a bit the window makes pen

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:11,039
and it's also used to to show these

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:14,960
quests dialog that is there there

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:17,200
the the assistant

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,000
that this character that that are

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,919
getting the

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,039
the kid around the request

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:28,160
giving tips on instructions

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:30,880
and these dialogues are

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,760
testing notifications but with with

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,600
custom

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:39,039
styles and a custom behavior

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,039
for for buttons

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,960
and it also provides a small device cpi

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,440
for a productive house to communicate

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:57,679
with the with the desktop

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,679
to have more more integration

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:07,280
and we we are here on the distribution

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:11,280
thing at first as i as we said

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:15,039
uh it was uh

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:18,960
it was a project an ls paul's project

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:23,039
so after it was

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,039
only on the hack computer but

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:32,960
some time ago we started to to to

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:36,080
to distribute on every unless

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,039
so right now if you install

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,400
the latest list you will see the hack

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,679
icon on the desktop

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,240
so it's there and you can use is there

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,240
by default

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,559
and right now we are working on the flat

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,110
version so

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,640
you can install um

00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:57,200
[Music]

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,080
so you can install right now on ubuntu

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,559
or

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:05,600
fedora or any game basic

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:09,840
distribution right now is that this

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:14,000
and the platform beta so if you

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,679
if you are able to to add the

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,679
better repository you can install the

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,760
clip house sidetrack and the operating

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,080
system application

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,720
and you can take a look right now the

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,039
current version is

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,320
because it isn't better i'm working on

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:32,960
that and

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:36,159
it could be broken from time to time but

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:39,679
right now you can you can test and try

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,000
the the clubhouse install automatically

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,280
the

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,320
the cell extension so you can

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:49,360
install the clip house as a flap pack

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,240
and at first when you run the clip house

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,440
the first time

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,480
it will ask you to

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,600
install the extension you will have a

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,159
dialogue

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,640
and clicking in a set with install

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:05,440
automatically the extension

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,400
so it's really easy to so the

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,600
distribution

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:13,440
is not too complex it's all

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:26,080
on flat and the extension is on

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:29,919
on vietnam and the desktop will install

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:33,919
and we we will release

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:36,000
these on as they all really soon

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:41,840
maybe the next month we will be

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,840
available for everyone on flat

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,640
and we have related to this we have

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:53,200
another

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:56,720
similar project using the same concept

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,360
uh that is the hapless is basically the

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,880
same

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,880
but in a way

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,480
so we created this webpage to try to

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,480
promote the

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,799
hack experience so if you are interested

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,240
on

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:17,280
this you you can

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:23,840
you can try it and there are a few

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:23,840
quests there

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:30,000
um what about the future of the

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,000
of the parade

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:38,640
there are a lot of work to do here

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,640
because right now this project

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,919
has some content but there are a lot of

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,640
possibilities

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,240
the idea behind we are releasing this

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,440
i'm trying to

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,200
to release everything

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,880
everything is free software is open

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,880
source

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,880
uh everything is on github

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,000
and and there are other things that we

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,960
can do

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,960
to improve this

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:14,080
one the first thing that we can

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,679
work on is the internationalization

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,000
because right now

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,880
right now this application now all the

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,320
content is

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:25,760
in english so

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:29,279
if this is directly designed

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:32,400
for kids so it is

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:35,520
it will be really really

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,080
important to have these the the

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:41,039
application and the content in

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,039
in another language

00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:48,240
[Music]

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:51,520
the ability to to do

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,760
a third party quest uh

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,640
it's something really interesting also

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,360
because

00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,159
if if we are able to create a community

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,679
we can have

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:05,679
something like uh like a quest

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:08,799
store or something like that so

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:11,360
anyone can create content and polish

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,360
content

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:18,640
it will be interesting to have

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,279
something like that to be able to to

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,559
have

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:25,760
uh more content because

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:28,480
at the end the technology behind this is

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,200
not really important the important thing

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,679
here is

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,679
is the the content

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:43,039
and we can use we can think about the

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:47,279
the flip the clip to hack experience

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:51,279
and we can think about integrate that

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:54,559
with for example genome default

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,360
development tools so for example for

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,240
newcomers

00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,600
it could be really interesting to have

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,720
something like

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,880
a wrong uh an application

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,080
again on application and being able to

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:12,240
click to get on builder

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:14,960
to just have the real code

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,240
behind the application and update that

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,000
code and flip back

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,000
and have the application updated

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,840
so there is something that

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,640
there is some some some interesting

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:35,279
ideas to explore

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:39,039
to try to make it easier to even easily

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:42,880
to to hack something on

00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:46,799
another desktop and make it easier

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,919
to contribute i'm talking about gonna be

00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,960
there but it

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,960
could be really

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,919
really easy to integrate these with

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,919
other

00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,279
with our application that we can call

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:03,039
toolbox

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:06,720
um being able to flip and

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:10,960
modify for example translations or

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:14,400
or the css or something like that

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,400
and the the

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:22,640
and another important point is to try to

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:27,279
to deploy more offline content

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,279
because right now everything is

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,600
there is a lot of content on the

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,840
internet but

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,360
there are a lot of kids that doesn't

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,200
have

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,760
internet connection or the internet

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,159
connection is not good

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,880
so if the application has the content

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,440
inside

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,440
it will be

00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:54,559
easier for for these kids to

00:27:50,480 --> 00:28:00,000
to to access to to the content directly

00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:00,000
and not having to to go to a different

00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,840
webpage

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:10,720
and that's all that i wanted to to talk

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,720
about

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,120
if you want to learn more about this you

00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:20,559
can

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:23,840
always ask me you can find me as

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:27,840
on irc on different vietnam irc

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,840
channels or matrix

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,840
or using this email

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:40,399
and if you have any questions i will

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,399
be happy to answer

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,880
okay and we have one question here i

00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,880
will answer in the notes

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:58,159
so what are the benefits or of

00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:01,679
the main specific language versus item

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:03,600
the benefit is that it will be easier to

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:07,919
write

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:13,760
quests at the end the quests are

00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:16,799
mostly texts

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:20,399
i mean it's text but with a

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:23,919
small logic the small logic

00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:27,840
is sold by these the ink language

00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,840
it saw that logic

00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:34,000
with with some debate um

00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:37,440
[Applause]

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,840
simple syntax is it's it's

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,840
like writing

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:49,919
mark down or something like that

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:55,760
so it will be easier to write quests

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:59,919
instead of writing a python code

00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,919
so you don't need to to write

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,320
at the end you will need to learn

00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:11,919
a specific language for the quest but

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:15,360
i think that it's it's

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,080
more semantic the the the specific

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,720
language

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,520
than python item is a generic language

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,679
and

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,520
you will be able to do everything with

00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,600
python and

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,120
the domain specific language will be

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,840
more

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,840
restricted

00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:37,840
so i think that that is the answer

00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,760
i didn't know if there are any other

00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,840
questions

00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,720
[Music]

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,399
okay if there are no other question i

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,559
have one actually

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,600
but it's not related to the code so i'm

00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,880
wondering whether

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,600
you have data like um testing with

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,519
children

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,760
like real life testing or control

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,880
situation where you can test out

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,240
how kids perform in the different tasks

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,120
or in the different questions you call

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,799
them

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,679
because i think that would be like very

00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,679
interesting to know

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,559
yeah we have uh during this

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:52,960
this project has a long time

00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:56,240
development i started to work on these

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:59,679
two years ago almost two years ago

00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:02,960
but there was

00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:06,399
people working on that before and

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:10,240
i'm doing this we at first we

00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:13,600
we have uh a playthrough with kids

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,720
with some kids every week that test

00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:20,000
is a specific content

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:23,360
um and we we

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,880
we try the test with real kids

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:29,440
and we get the feedback to continue with

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,840
the work

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:37,519
so the content

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:42,000
is is based on on that feedback

00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:45,200
and the main idea of this interactive

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,320
uh quest is based on

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:53,360
this feedback we we tested this

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:57,840
with kids so yes

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,840
this is really interesting the

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:04,080
um um and we have done this

00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,080
before

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:13,840
but sadly right now we have now the

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:17,360
resources to do that anymore um

00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:20,480
it's harder now to test with real

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:24,399
kids to try to to

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:38,680
test the actual content or

00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:46,599
or the experience

00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:46,599
[Music]

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,699
[Music]

00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,840
is there any other question if you want

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,480
please type it in the chat or in the

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,480
shared note

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,480
there are some comments saying that the

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,480
kids love the the play test you need

00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,320
right so i guess if there are no other

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,000
questions where we left your email

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,520
address actually in the shared note

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,159
so if someone wants to contact you

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,760
they can and i guess we can thank you

00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:47,919
for this amazing presentation

00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:47,919
