Title: Keynote: The Prism of Collaborative Marketing in Open Source - Melissa Logan
Publication date: 2020-11-15
Playlist: Linux App Summit 2020 Talks
Description: 
	The role of marketing in open source is to increase usage and adoption, and collaborating with members of your ecosystem can vastly extend your reach. But developing a shared vision across multiple organizations with different goals requires as much finesse as working on open source code itself—neutrality, trust, and a willingness to find common ground are crucial. How do you create an architecture of participation? This keynote demonstrates how marketing, refracted through an open source ecosystem, expands the spectrum of outcomes more than any single organization acting alone.

About Melissa:
A 20-year veteran of technology marketing that began in the dot-com era, Melissa Logan pioneered the role of the open source marketer that helped fuel the rise of open source software development. She led marketing for open source projects at The Linux Foundation and founded Constantia.io, a firm that supports open source projects/companies such as Apache Cassandra, Tidelift, and others. Previously, she worked with companies as diverse as Microsoft, Isilon (acquired by EMC), Octarine (acquired by VMware), Meridian (acquired by Aruba Networks), and others.

Logan loves all things open source and community, and spends the rest of her time riding horses in the vaquero style. She launched the Sexism Field Guide in 2018 to help people identify and confront all forms of sexism. Logan graduated from the University of Oregon with a degree in Journalism and Political Science, but only uses one of those.

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,320
excellent thank you so much hi

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,320
everybody it's really good to be here i

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,320
it's early in my day i'm outside of

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,879
portland oregon i know that this is a

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,840
global conference so nice to know where

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,879
people are

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,480
uh and tuning in from all over the place

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:58,800
um so just some background on myself i

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,000
uh melissa logan i've worked in tech for

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,359
20 years

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,080
i'm here today to talk about my

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,040
experiences with ecosystem and marketing

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,159
on behalf of

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,159
open source communities um

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,240
if a community you work with is hoping

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,720
to have as technology

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,920
become more widely adopted this talk

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,000
should hopefully give you a framework

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,920
for how to support that effort

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,840
and i'm more than happy to answer

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:27,840
questions at the end

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,759
so uh first just some background on

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,040
myself i started

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,479
in the dot com era uh doing tech

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,680
marketing i've been at it for about 20

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,079
years as i mentioned

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,799
and about a decade ago i started working

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,040
in open source at the linux foundation

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,320
where i was focused on digital strategy

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,079
and ecosystem

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,520
which essentially means understanding

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,720
the needs of the community

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,240
and then understanding the needs of the

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,600
end users and figuring out a way to

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,360
bridge that gap uh with information

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,520
but my most awesome claims to fame which

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,439
you can see on here is that i was on the

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,560
first intro to linux tutorial on

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,719
edx there in the middle and i rode on a

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,840
mardi gras float with lena sorbolds

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,840
at linuxcon in 2013. uh

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,520
today i run a marketing firm that

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,480
specializes in open source and

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,360
enterprise tech companies at

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,200
constantia.io

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,280
uh and today i just want to talk a

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,200
little bit about rainbows

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,200
and a lot about communities

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,920
so

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:38,080
sorry about that advancing my slides

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,920
so presumably everyone here today works

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,000
with free and open source communities

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,959
uh you already understand the value of

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,040
having multiple people contributing code

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,720
building something that no one person

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,800
could build by yourself

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,400
that same model can be applied to

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,680
marketing as well

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,319
collaborating with people in your

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,560
ecosystem that are around your project

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,040
can greatly expand your reach

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,840
and this can be achieved by centralizing

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,920
a marketing effort for your project

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,599
centralizing it creates a focal point

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,000
around which people can contribute

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,200
similar and open source where you have

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,200
code that's in public

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,319
that means everyone can contribute you

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,760
can do something similar on the

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,840
marketing front

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,920
so i'm going to share some examples of

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,440
the outsize impact that a collaborative

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,440
marketing effort can have

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,080
so the way we often measure the impact

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,120
of marketing in an open source

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,440
project at a macro level it's not github

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,840
stars it's not lines of code it's

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,840
something called share a voice uh it's

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,840
essentially a gauge on how frequently

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,599
your product or project is being talked

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,920
about across the internet

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,680
in forums and news and other third party

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,799
outlets and reddit and all that good

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,480
stuff

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,400
in this example i just use a really

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,159
simple kind of not a

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,920
traditional sharea voice tool but just

00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,239
using google trends

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,920
it's a simple way to gauge typically we

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,360
use other tools to get that get a lot

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,680
more granular but this will just give

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,920
you

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,040
an idea of how you can kind of quickly

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,439
look and see

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,640
what's being said about a project to

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,879
understand the difference in what a

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,879
centralized marketing effort can have i

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,880
compared two similar open source

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,160
projects in the cloud space

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,000
um one with a specific coordinated

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,919
effort which is openstack

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,080
and one with a more informal marketing

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,080
structure which was cloud stack

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,960
so openstack as you all probably know

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,840
has a centralized paid marketing team

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,520
uh cloud stack as an apache project has

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,880
a less formal structure

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,960
so they created a framework to

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,520
participate but didn't have a directed

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,560
effort

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,680
uh on an ongoing basis and as you can

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,960
see in this chart

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,960
interest in openstack has been

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,880
significantly higher over

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,960
the life cycle of the project compared

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,320
with cloud stack

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,080
so certainly there are other market

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,600
factors at play in all of this but a

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,440
centralized marketing effort

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,840
did have a measurable impact on the

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,800
growth of openstack over cloud stack

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,240
over its life cycle and iv marketing

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,880
really is giving a project

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,560
its best chance at life our aim is

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,160
really to try to educate people about

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,720
their choices with the hope that it will

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,960
increase

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,880
usage and adoption like i said a lot of

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,280
things go into that but it really can

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:25,039
help

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:26,639
in a significant way

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,280
so another metric we look at is

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,479
contributions so more awareness in a

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,639
project

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,720
driven by marketing often translates to

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,840
more contributions

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,000
i know that not every project wants more

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,600
contributions

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,080
there might not be enough enough people

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,960
to review uh or maybe your governance is

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,800
not set up

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,880
or developed in the right way yet maybe

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,280
you're just not ready for other reasons

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,880
but it is often a natural byproduct of

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,360
marketing so we like to look at it as

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,000
another

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,120
health and key health indicator so in

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,800
these two graphs

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,199
we're looking again at cloud stack and

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,759
openstack cloud stack is on the left

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,120
openstack is on the right so i will say

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,120
a couple things

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,319
one these don't start at exactly the

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,919
same time there's a three year

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,440
difference based on when these projects

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,639
began

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,639
but they're pretty they're roughly

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,120
around the same time frame and

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,000
two the scale is different so openstack

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,199
on the right

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,520
it goes up to 300 on the y-axis on

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,880
cloud stock on the left goes up to 150.

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,600
so what you're seeing is that

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,520
openstack at its peak was dramatically

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,800
higher in terms of contributions

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,560
um that over a cloud stack

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,160
and again there are other market factors

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,199
that work here but this does show a

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,280
correlation

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,400
between interest in a project driven by

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,360
marketing and usage and adoption

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,199
so the question is how do you centralize

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,560
a marketing effort in a disaggregated

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,720
ecosystem

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,319
so cloud stack would be that at some

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,360
level it's easier for an organization

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,599
like openstack

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,960
because it has a central paid team how

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,960
do you kind of compete against that

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,400
so participation in open source as you

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,680
all probably know

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,440
is is driven by self-interest

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,960
different people are participating for a

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,680
lot of different reasons so

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,000
in this picture here there's people who

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,840
create

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,199
distributions that participate for their

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,800
specific reason

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,440
you might have a solution built on top

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,120
of it you might have apps or services or

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,400
integrate with it or integrate your

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,240
product with it

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,319
there are consultancies and integrators

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,919
that create managed services around

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,479
open source and then of course you have

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,680
end users and and so on and so forth

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,280
your

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,919
array of people might look a little bit

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,840
different but really at the center here

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,520
there is a collective interest and

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,039
with each one of these people has a

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,840
collective interest in keeping this

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,240
project

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,319
healthy stable and growing so in the

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,319
case of the linux app ecosystem

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,479
there's a desire to standardize certain

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,960
elements from a technical perspective

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,240
and increase adoption and interest so it

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,080
really would benefit

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,520
the whole ecosystem to work collectively

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,120
on that challenge

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,879
and that's really where you start when

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,400
you think about collaborative marketing

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,319
and open source project

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,360
finding that common ground what is that

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,599
collective interest and that can be done

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,120
formally or informally you can do

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,280
research you can have

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,400
one-on-one conversations with people you

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,080
can have official

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,840
community meetings it's really whatever

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,160
makes sense for your community

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,840
in fact throughout this presentation

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,759
this is a general framework but your

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,199
community has its own norms and values

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,039
so you might do things a little bit

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,479
differently

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,399
but once you understand what is that

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,640
collective interest here at the center

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,000
you can develop a shared vision or a

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,760
goal for the future

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,760
with the members of your ecosystem

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,880
so after identifying that collective

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,839
interest you need to then

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,240
recruit people to lead the marketing

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,240
effort

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,560
marketing and open source is similar to

00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,920
a startup but there is a key difference

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,600
these people don't work at the same

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,160
company they're not on your internal

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,680
team

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,160
they don't get a paycheck from you

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,320
they're very often volunteers

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,360
that's why that identifying that

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,440
collective interest

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,920
and defining your shared goal is really

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,839
really important

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,680
it's equally important to find the right

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,920
types of people to work on

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,080
the effort with the right personal

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,000
personalities and expertise

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,000
on the personality side you want people

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,480
to act as a neutral entity

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,760
on behalf of your entire ecosystem you

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,519
don't want someone who's going to come

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,120
in and try to drive their own personal

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,120
interests so they really do need to be

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,959
this kind of neutral arbiter

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,320
for the that acts on behalf of the

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,080
entire community

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,160
not influenced by the loudest voices etc

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,640
on the expertise side you do want to

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,560
have someone with marketing expertise

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,320
they should absolutely understand your

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,279
technology and how it fits into the

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,120
landscape

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,480
but they should also have knowledge of

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,959
the best places to reach

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,560
your specific audience they should have

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,560
relationships with media and analysts if

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,079
that's something that you need

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,240
they need to also understand how

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,320
marketing is changing during covid

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,240
things are changing pretty rapidly these

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,760
days with how people are reaching people

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,240
i think you all know we're getting a lot

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,160
of webinar fatigue and things like this

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,000
so you really have to understand they

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,760
should understand what's happening

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,279
in the marketing world to see what's

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,200
working and what's not

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,040
and these people can come from within

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,000
your community or they can be outside

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,920
your community

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,600
again it really is up to what makes

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,079
sense the most sense for people

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,839
that you uh communicate with on a

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,839
regular basis

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,000
so once you determine that shared goal

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,120
and you figure out who that group of

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,920
people person or

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,040
a group of people is who can help direct

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,040
this effort

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,079
then comes the really hard work of

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,160
asking the

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,480
broader ecosystem or community to

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,399
participate in that

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,399
it's no easy task how do you get people

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,079
to volunteer their time when they have

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,240
a lot of other things going on and

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,920
especially now during the pandemic

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,680
they have there are even more

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,959
constraints on people's time than ever

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,680
before

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,360
and i found that actually uh regardless

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,120
of whether someone is paid full time to

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,360
work on open source or not

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,519
or they're a volunteer marketing is

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,519
typically the last thing they think of

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,600
they don't volunteer they volunteer to

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,360
contribute code not marketing

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,640
that's why defining that shared vision

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,519
again is really crucial

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,959
if you have that similar interest then

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,959
the ask becomes a lot easier

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,720
it can also help to design an

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,920
architecture of participation

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,120
for people to contribute for the

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,040
marketing effort

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,519
and there are both formal and informal

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,519
ways you can do this

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,800
some projects have formal governance

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,320
around marketing

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,079
and bylaws it's in these documents

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,639
uh there may be a committee that hosts

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,320
regular meetings so on and so forth

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,079
on the left hand side here you have this

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,959
example from the cloud native computing

00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,360
foundation

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,440
where marketing is is written into the

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,440
bylaws

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,440
others may meet more informally or

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,040
create a more general guideline on how

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,560
to participate that's what you see on

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,160
the right hand side this is again a

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,160
cloud stack example

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,000
this is on their wiki and it just

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,600
outlines how you can contribute to the

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,040
marketing effort

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,040
whether or not people followed up on

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,839
this front i can't say i'm not part of

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,519
that community

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,120
but at least you have some general

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,600
guidelines here

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,680
for people to participate kubernetes

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,680
does something similar

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,079
with guidelines on how to contribute and

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,560
they put them right into the github repo

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,959
so anyone can see but really in either

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,040
scenario defining that shared goal

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,200
and outcomes gives people a framework to

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,480
work backward from and contribute to

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,680
it makes it really concrete again you

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,519
really need to figure out what works

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,800
best for your community

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,120
and i encourage you to put it into

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,240
writing so it's normalized as a best

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,399
practice

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,480
and a side benefit of this is that it

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,839
encourages those non-technical type of

00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,600
contributions

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,880
to an open source project which can be

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:07,200
just as valuable as a code contribution

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:09,680
docs is a really good example of this

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,160
once you've defined that framework to

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,399
centralize the marketing effort

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,320
then your community acts like a prism

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,480
for your efforts

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,720
refracting a single contribution into

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,880
this beautiful array just like in open

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,560
source software development

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,320
you contribute code that by itself might

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,079
be useful but refracted through the

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,519
community becomes something much much

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,440
greater

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,399
that's what open source can do and

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,760
that's what we can achieve with

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,920
collaborative marketing this really

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,200
beautiful rainbow effect

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,120
and i'm going to give you some examples

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,959
of this in practice but first i want to

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,440
talk a little bit about the term

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,440
marketing

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,639
so most people when you say marketing

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,519
immediately think of ads

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,040
or landing pages or those thousands of

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,519
automated emails you get

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,199
with people trying to sell you something

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,720
the most intrusive forms of marketing

00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,920
which are memorable because they're very

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,040
annoying

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,680
um that's not typically what we do at

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,360
its core

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,720
marketing is about communicating with

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,959
your end users

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,639
you need to understand your end users in

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,279
order to communicate with them about the

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,519
value of your product or service

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,959
and how you do that will be dictated by

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,480
your industry

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:22,480
your market and the end user preferences

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,519
so in open source people don't buy your

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,920
product

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,560
they adopt it but the core marketing

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,399
principle

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,399
is the same you're trying to give people

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,639
something of value so they understand

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,880
and appreciate and hopefully adopt your

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,720
product or project

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,720
and marketing can include everything

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,360
from public relations

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,279
so working with journalists analyst

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,320
relations working with analyst firms and

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,120
so on

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,800
uh research that you can conduct to

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,959
understand your end users

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,240
your market your industry so on and so

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,959
forth

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,560
content which can include things like

00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,000
executive level pieces

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,760
to tutorials or docs you could create an

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,839
ecosystem marketplace

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,279
you could do advertising yes you can do

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,120
automated emails

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,279
although i'd recommend using them very

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,040
sparingly and

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,000
trying to make sure that you have

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,920
something of value in there for people

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,360
uh speaking at events or there's a

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,440
multitude of other activities

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,839
um there's there's just a huge laundry

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,959
list of things you can do and

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,440
dependent on who your end users are

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,199
and how you think they will they would

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,839
like to receive that information from

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,680
you

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,000
it's really anything designed to grow

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,440
adoption and interest in a project

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,199
uh that that's what falls under the

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,839
marketing umbrella so i'm gonna share

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,839
some examples with you

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,959
so probably about five or six years ago

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,079
now i worked with

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:54,480
a project called uh cloud foundry

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,519
it is an open source uh platform as a

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,199
service

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,199
and at that time we had a charter to

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,279
grow awareness for the cloud foundry

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,519
ecosystem to help fuel adoption

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,800
for the project and for the different

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,600
distributions that were

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,279
available on cloud foundry there were

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,759
several commercial distributions at that

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,000
time

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,120
and thousands of services and

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,040
integrations

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,639
but what we kept hearing that is that

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,240
end users weren't always aware of the

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,079
breadth of the ecosystem they didn't

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,600
understand what their choices were

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,360
and you wouldn't know it if you visited

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,560
the main website back then

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,000
there was information about

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,920
distributions but really you couldn't

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,680
see it all in one place

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,839
so to showcase the breadth of that

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,920
ecosystem we decided to create a

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,199
centralized marketplace to aggregate all

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,320
those pieces

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,839
and then in those redirecting them to

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,759
specific solutions

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,360
essentially serving as a pass through

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,600
for the members of our ecosystem

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,519
each distribution had its own site that

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,120
showcased its own ecosystem but our goal

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,880
was to try to bring them together in one

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,320
place to demonstrate the strength of the

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,079
entire community

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,600
really acting like a top of funnel

00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:01,600
source for all distributions

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,279
but we had a relatively small team it

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,559
was just me and a couple of devs so we

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,439
had to get kind of creative

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,039
there were about there were over 5 000

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,919
individual services

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,760
distribution solutions etc so there was

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,199
no way that we could manually do this

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,959
and bring it together

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,640
so we got permission from all the

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,799
members of the ecosystem the core

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,240
distributions and created scripts for it

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,120
and then built this frame that you see

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,160
here

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,079
uh around it and the result was this

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,200
centralized location so end users could

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,520
browse the entire

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,360
ecosystem in one place and connect

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,520
directly with partners on solutions that

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,360
they needed

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,440
in tandem with this we also built a

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,520
campaign to promote this

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,919
and the new page was promoted by all key

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,520
players in our ecosystem

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:49,520
and how we measured success of this was

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,960
we did see web traffic increase by i

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,919
think 20

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,919
um but really more importantly the

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,000
participants the distributions

00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,679
um the integrators all the people in

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,559
this in this

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,440
marketplace saw their traffic increase

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,440
um with us

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,120
being the referral site and that was a

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,320
huge win because that was the ultimate

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,520
goal it's not about

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,520
us retaining that uh the traffic it's

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,880
about passing that traffic on onto the

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,760
distributions and the people in the

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,760
ecosystem

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,600
so it really was a win-win for everybody

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,559
it helped kind of grow that pie for

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,080
everybody

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,600
and this is why i think about open

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,679
source marketing like a prism

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,160
their individual contributions being

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:31,760
refracted through this community lens

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,520
on this community site produced this

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,360
unified but really diverse marketing

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,600
effort on the other side

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,559
and i'll talk a little bit more on the

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,320
next slide about

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:44,160
how we actually got everyone to promote

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,160
it because that is no easy task either

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,919
so this is another example from cloud

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,559
foundry again

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,440
building a marketplace is relatively

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,200
straightforward

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,360
it's not that it wasn't hard it was just

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,640
relatively straightforward

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,799
but getting people to actually

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,039
participate in promoting this

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,400
in a collective way that was actually

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,400
harder

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,559
every participant has their own

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,240
marketing goals they have their own

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,440
you know needs and demands and things

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,760
that they're thinking about they're

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,280
trying to sell their own products right

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,960
and why would they help promote this

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,840
marketplace that points

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,760
people somewhere else um at that time

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,960
cloud foundry i think had about 50

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,880
members

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,720
remember we were pretty small team we

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,280
had two major events to put on every

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,679
year

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,120
along with our day-to-day marketing work

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,799
and we really didn't have time to

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,080
connect with every single member of that

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,080
ecosystem

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,440
50 new people anytime we had some new

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,039
marketing initiative

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,799
so we thought we would experiment with

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,280
putting together a

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,200
web portal essentially kind of a member

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,400
portal that incentivized people to

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,640
participate

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,520
in marketing by offering additional

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,400
benefits

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,840
to those who did so for example

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,240
promoting the new marketplace

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,200
was one of the campaigns that we created

00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,520
and

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,720
pushed out through this dashboard so

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,240
it's kind of an experiment we thought

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,600
we'd try something new and see how it

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,240
worked

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,000
we created a series of actions that we

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,400
wanted the community to take

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,240
and benefits that they would receive for

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,320
doing so

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,440
an example of this was promoting the

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,520
marketplace

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,840
using a specific link that we gave them

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,240
that had specific utm parameters over a

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,480
certain period of time

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,159
and the ask was please promote this you

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,360
know to your network over

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:32,000
social media or email or wherever

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,320
else it might make sense and then clicks

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,080
were shown on a leaderboard

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,240
and when certain thresholds were met

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,159
they would receive a benefit such as a

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,280
special social media tweet

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,120
or t-shirts or a logo on a newsletter

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,320
really kind of simple things but useful

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,480
to participate

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,520
participants and also kind of fed back

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,840
into our

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,559
shared goal of promoting the ecosystem

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,840
from our

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:57,039
neutral point of view and actually

00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,039
determining the

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,320
actions and benefits was more difficult

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,159
than the technology

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,600
we we wanted to make sure we offered

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,000
something of value it wasn't

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,840
you know it wasn't junk what could we

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,280
track what would be meaningful

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,440
you know all of these types of things so

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,679
we iterated on that we got a lot of

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,799
feedback from the ecosystem as we were

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,320
building it out to

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,760
and then really just kind of tested it

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,760
as we went um

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,919
the other benefit of this this portal

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,559
was that we had a lot of other

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,480
collateral

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,600
on it so we use it as kind of our our

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,919
docs store

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,440
and put collateral faqs you could see

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,919
some links on the left-hand side so

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,840
there was a

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:37,840
this became a hub for our ecosystem to

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,000
participate in our marketing our

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,159
collaborative marketing efforts

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,360
so before we implemented this it we

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,799
weren't really sure who was

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,880
actually doing things when we would send

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,760
out materials so it's hard to gauge

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,159
um before and after from the beginning

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,000
but

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,080
after we started using this over several

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,240
campaigns we saw a 22

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,799
increase in participation from campaign

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,840
one to two two to three three to four

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:05,600
so it really did spark some additional

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,600
participation from our community

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,480
so moving to a different example the the

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,080
first two with cloud foundry were a

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,640
little more complex they might require a

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,320
little more time and funding to do

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,080
i wanted to do something share something

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,720
that was a little more lightweight

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,320
um but could help you raise awareness

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,520
and interest for a project or your

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,280
ecosystem

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,760
so this is for the apache cassandra

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,760
community

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,320
we were hired to work with them to be a

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,919
neutral marketing contributor

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,520
by data stacks it's a company that

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,880
provides a commercial distribution on

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,640
top of cassandra

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,240
they really understand the value that

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,840
community marketing can have

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,559
not just for their business but for the

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,360
broader ecosystem

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,480
and we wanted to start digging into

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,840
mailing lists

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,520
getting to know contributors and

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,320
committers really understanding the

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,640
technology

00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,520
and the ecosystem and the landscape to

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,520
uncover

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,880
what are those untold stories in the

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,320
community that we should be

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,240
bringing forward cassandra is a really

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,919
powerful open source database it's used

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,480
by some of the world's largest companies

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,240
like apple netflix target etc

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,600
but if you looked at your website in the

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,360
first half of this year

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,360
you'd think there wasn't much happening

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,640
in the community and that simply was not

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,000
true the community had been working on

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,400
its next release

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,760
uh 4.0 and we found a lot of great

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,559
stories to tell

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,440
about the beta release about individual

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,200
features

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,480
that were in the release about new

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,039
testing tools

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,400
there were new projects being proposed

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,480
we also looked at the

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,440
user slack and user mailing list to see

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,080
what were

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,799
what common struggles that new users had

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,200
that we could

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,120
share solutions for or wanted to

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,000
understand better there's really a lot

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,000
to share

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,200
but without a dedicated marketing

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,520
contributor what

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,039
you heard about cassandra came in fits

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,559
and starts so

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:01,039
if you look back on their blog i think

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:03,440
there was just one blog in 2018

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,960
maybe four in 2018 so it was really kind

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,640
of inconsistent

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,320
um what you would know about the

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,919
community if you went to their website

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,600
as the key source which most people

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,080
would do

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,159
so in working with a community we wrote

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,600
and or asked people to write blogs about

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,360
4.0

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,039
and other topics for the main website

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,240
and that's what you see here

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:26,000
um the left hand side and then we also

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,880
help some of that content be placed on

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,159
other sites

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,640
like opensource.com or dzone or hacker

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,799
noon

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,080
or container journal and so forth so

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,080
people were not only hearing about

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,360
cassandra who were looking directly at

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,200
the cassandra website

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,600
maybe people who already knew about it

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,360
but also reaching people where

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,320
hopefully new people who were interested

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,480
in cassandra as a database

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,559
and since we started that effort i think

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,080
there have been one to two posts every

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,919
month on the site

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,760
as well as about as many in other media

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,520
outlets too so the ripple effect now is

00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,200
that the site is getting more traffic

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,880
and the community also is being

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,480
recognized for its efforts all the stuff

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,279
that we're already doing we just kind of

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,279
brought forward

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:16,720
so as a marketer

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,480
where do you find ideas to communicate i

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,799
just talked about some of them

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,320
in open source there's no central place

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,720
where you can go figure that out there's

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,039
no

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,120
product roadmap not always sometimes but

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,440
there isn't typically a product roadmap

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,039
like you have in a proprietary company

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,520
but i'd argue that at open source you

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,080
actually

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,960
have a broader range of sources to draw

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,880
from

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,240
your ecosystem and your community are

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,080
super powers and you don't need

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,880
permission to go talk to them and figure

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,400
things out

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,159
we're in a company you might have to go

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,640
get permission can i talk to this

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,400
vendor can i talk to this person etc in

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,320
open source there are so many people you

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,200
can talk to to understand and find

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,480
sources for

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,200
marketing and this slide is just putting

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,039
together

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,640
a few things that might spike spark

00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,279
ideas for you

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,360
so of course on the top technology

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,760
what's happening with the release cycle

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,000
what is coming up in the road map what

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,679
projects exist today and are there new

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,600
ones being introduced

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,279
what conversations might be bubbling up

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,200
in community

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,679
on the community side who is

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,000
contributing who is participating

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,919
how diverse is it how inclusive is it

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,440
are there hobbyists doing cool things

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,120
do you have ambassadors doing cool

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,720
things do you

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,799
have community awards or should you

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,600
create community awards for your

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,559
for folks uh who are the de facto

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,320
spokespeople

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,679
um just really digging into the

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,039
personalities of people in your

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,000
community

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:42,240
i know that a lot of there are some

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,600
projects that have pretty charismatic

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,159
leaders

00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,440
and that can get a lot of visibility for

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,679
community

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,200
in the absence of that marketing can

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,120
help find those

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,360
people and find those stories if you

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,520
don't have this charismatic leader

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,200
then how can you do that i think a mar a

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,240
good mark reader will go figure that out

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,760
and find out

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,679
who those voices are and bring them

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,200
forward

00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,039
and then of course your end users in

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,679
open source can you figure out who's

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,400
using it

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,640
will they do a case study will they talk

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,880
about their use cases so on and so forth

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,799
how are they using the project

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,480
specific use cases again you can create

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,240
a whole list of these how are people

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,600
using it

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,399
skills is your project hard to adopt and

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,720
use

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,320
maybe it is maybe it isn't how long does

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,399
it take who's writing docs

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,600
are there docs even can you do training

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,360
and certification

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,799
so what are the skills needed for your

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,559
project and

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:41,679
can you help people on board faster

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:43,919
and then of course in your ecosystem uh

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,760
what integrations are being used what

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,960
are people building on top of what does

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,960
it work with

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,520
and what do competitive ecosystems look

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,960
like both proprietary and open source

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,960
because that's who you want to be

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,440
comparing with at some level and showing

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,520
how

00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,360
the value of your ecosystem and your

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,120
project

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,840
can people easily contribute so on and

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,840
so forth

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,600
and really that's the kind of summary of

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,360
the talk and i hope by now you have

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,880
a better understanding of how marketing

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,919
can help an open source

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,600
project this slide just shows you

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,039
what i call an open source marketing

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,799
flywheel it just shows you when you

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,240
understand the technology

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,159
you dig into that you apply some

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,200
marketing to it it increases awareness

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,440
and interest

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,960
then you have people adopting it and

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,640
creating new integrations on it

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,399
which then they contribute back into the

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,120
technology and it just goes into this

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:41,440
nice little circle

00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,559
um i hope this gave you a bit of a

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,919
framework of how you might look at your

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,760
own community

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,360
figure out who those stakeholders are

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,080
figure out what your collective interest

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,799
is

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,919
and and how to get those multiple

00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:55,520
stakeholders involved in a collaborative

00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,360
marketing effort

00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,480
i am more than happy to answer any

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,480
questions that you have

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,480
quickly before we do that i wanted to

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,520
mention that we are printing just a few

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,039
of these

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,000
linux prism t-shirts so if you want one

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,000
just let me know

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,600
send me a tweet to melissa underscore

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
b2b and

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,799
my only ass is that you wear it so with

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,679

and uh help you work through those

00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,960
i'd like to give a plug to the sustain

00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,640
oss podcast too

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,000
which they do have a marketing working

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,600
group that talks about this type of

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,480
stuff i think it's bi-weekly every

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,480
thursday

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,000
i join when i can i can't always join

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,039
but it's a great

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:18,799
group to just bounce ideas off of too in

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:21,440
terms of marketing for your communities

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,559
yes moiny i totally get it it is tough

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,480
to get people to write

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:29,440
i think uh one thing you might consider

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,480
if someone if you have topics but get

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,519
have people have a

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,559
blank page it's it's can be more

00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,399
difficult

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,919
if there's someone who could even write

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,720
outlines for people that can

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,320
often expedite things for that for you

00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,919
if you just give them something to think

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,519
about some kind of framework that might

00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:49,200
be a way to

00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:51,600
help people get started on writing

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,360
i know i certainly do i did with this

00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,320
keynote it freaks me out to have a blank

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,840
page

00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:01,519
so if you give them something to work

00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:05,120
off of it uh it'll help

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,480
um let's see and mahala comment on the

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,000
difficulties marketing and

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,240
non-programmers face when trying to

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,159
contribute in open source projects

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,840
there are usually many obstacles from

00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,559
devs they seem to feel marketing as

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:20,399
corporate evil or unnecessary

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:22,000
yeah i think this is true um so

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,919
let me just talk first about there are

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,640
technical difficulties often when

00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,039
contributing to open source projects

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,720
so for example for the cassandra

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,880
community if you wanted to contribute a

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,679
blog you have to download the

00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,279
the cassandra website dev environment

00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,000
figure out how to do all that stuff

00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:41,039
and then push a website push a blog up

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,960
to as a pr

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,799
and then get it accepted and that

00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,640
creates a technical barrier i think for

00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:49,919
non-technical contributors

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,519
um so the less in a community if you can

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:54,640
lessen those technical barriers that

00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:58,159
will help more people contribute

00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:01,039
in terms of general

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,159
perception of marketing in open source i

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,039
think it's true i

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,799
this is why i frame the talk around it's

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,120
not about

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,399
those automated emails and channels and

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,399
social media and this that and the other

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,679
it could be that and that's fine but

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,000
what you're trying to do is provide

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:19,679
something of value so i would say

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,519
look at what your when you talk to the

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,600
people in the open source community

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,799
say you're trying to reflect what

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,519
they're doing

00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:29,120
and show them how you can do that so in

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:33,120
cassandra it's

00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:34,640
not a fluffy automation email but it's

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,840
how how what are they doing with the

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,320
technology and how is that useful to end

00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:41,519
users um

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:43,039
we found out for example that bloomberg

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,279
was using cassandra

00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,880
we put it in the newsletter and sent it

00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,720
out and bloomberg was thrilled about

00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,880
that they were excited to see

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,320
that that you know that we noticed that

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,000
and that was just kind of a small

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,919
mention we found on a website

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,440
so i think it's just how do you find the

00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,240
ways that you can show that

00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,679
marketing is valuable it's not about

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,919
social media or

00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,600
web traffic or whatever it's about what

00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,240
is happening in your community

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,359
that you can showcase and demonstrate to

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,359
potential end users

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:21,839
does that help i'm happy to go into that

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:21,839
more as well if you like

00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,560
and that's a good question it's very

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,800
difficult

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,599
there is a perception that marketing is

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,320
not that

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,280
of marketing just being things like

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,200
advertising

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,000
and that's not it it's it's much more

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,000
diverse than that

00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,639
so the question from alex was do you

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,560
have ideas as to how to convince

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,639
non-programmers to work on marketing

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:56,560
besides hiring them

00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:58,400
so it's true i think marketing

00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,160
so as i mentioned even people who are

00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,440
paid to work on open source they don't

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,200
think about marketing

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,760
they think about contributing code as

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,960
their main contribution

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,040
i will say though if they're

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,560
contributing code and it's really cool

00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,680
they'll probably want to write about it

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,520
so that's one way to

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,079
get them involved is to say we really

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,320
want to showcase this cool new

00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,280
like fuzz testing tool that you created

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,359
or this new

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,800
update that you made to you know such

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:29,359
and such project

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,280
and we found that's really effective in

00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:33,040
in

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,440
and it's a win-win right it showcases

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,960
the project and the the momentum as well

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,599
as this individual person

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,359
and so we we will help them put that on

00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,960
paper and then try to get that into an

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,880
outlet like a d-zone

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,400
or hacker noon or something like that so

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,599
it really is kind of a win-win-win

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,880
what's in it for them well they get

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,440
recognition for the things that they're

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,440
contributing

00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,560
so how would you approach contributing

00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,640
to a project that doesn't have much

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,240
non-programming people involved

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,599
what are things that can be done without

00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,440
wasting a lot of time that can show

00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,400
results

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,280
so i would say content is probably one

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,599
of the ease

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,119
well it's not easy but it's something

00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,480
that is

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:20,960
typically of high value that

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,839
that can get a lot of visibility for a

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,160
project that may not take a ton of time

00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:27,040
so in that last example again i think if

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,200
you someone

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,480
contributed something really cool to a

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,000
project

00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,920
have them write that up and you can

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,480
again create that outline for them

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,480
write that up help them edit it and then

00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,440
you take it and try to place it on a

00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,520
site

00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,440
uh there are a lot of really great self

00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,480
public self-publishing sites out there

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,599
too

00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,960
dev.t.o i've mentioned d-zone i

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,680
mentioned hacker noon

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,520
these are really great places for people

00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,079
to showcase their work and that might be

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,480
a good place

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,480
to start

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:09,839
no problem

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,960
if no more questions then you all know

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,880
