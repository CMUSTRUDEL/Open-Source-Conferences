Title: Distribution of Qt apps to other platforms
Publication date: 2021-05-30
Playlist: Linux App Summit 2021 Talks
Description: 
	A story of an app which is distributed to Linux, Mac OS and Windows.

In this talk I want to share my experience with distribution of Qt apps to all major platforms. I'm going to talk about tools and methods I use and also about specific requirements each platform, like Windows and Mac OS, have compared to Linux and who knows, maybe you will tell me how to do it better and simple.

Q&A


1. I wrote a Qt app with Kirigami and k18n. While I'm strugling to varying extent to create builds for non-Linux platforms, I'm struggling the hardest to create a build for iOS. I know it is possible to do since Subsurface was ported to run there, but I cannot find any documentaion on how to do it. What steps could one take to create this build?

2. Where did you obtain the certificate for signing on Windows?

3.How robust would you consider is MingGW for crosscompiling Windows versions from Linux compared to compiling natively from Windows?

4. Do you think you could run WSL 2/WSL to run the tools instead of MingW on Windows?

5. Have you tried uploading your app to the Apple and Windows App stores?.

6. Have you seen the talk done by Dan and Arjan on Friday? :)
