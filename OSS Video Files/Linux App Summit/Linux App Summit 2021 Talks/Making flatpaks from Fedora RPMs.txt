Title: Making flatpaks from Fedora RPMs
Publication date: 2021-05-30
Playlist: Linux App Summit 2021 Talks
Description: 
	Some of you may know flatpaks as a new, distribution-independent way to distribute your applications. But did you know there is a direct way to turn your Fedora RPM package into flatpak in the Fedora infrastructure?
In the talk, I would like to explain the idea behind flatpak and the difference between standard flatpaks (eg. from flathub) and the Fedora ones. After this brief introduction, I would aim at the process of the RPM-to-flatpak conversion, what is needed and how to perform a successful conversion. Finally, I would demonstrate the whole process of conversion on some simple application.
This talk is aimed at developers and RPM package maintainers (rather than end users).



Author(s) Bio

I currently work as an intern in Redhat in Brno, CZ. My job is converting RPMs into flatpaks and helping people interested in the idea to convert their own application.


Q&A


1. Isn't this a fragmentation risk?

2. Why is it necessary to list the RPMs? Can't this be determined by looking at the app's (build) dependencies, then subtracting the packages which are included in the SDK/runtime?

3. What is the difference between fedora-runtime and the other runtimes (GNOME, KDE, freedesktop)?

4. Are there downsides to packages built this way?

5. can the container specify what architecture to be used? A few projects are armhf only for now as example?

6. So the plan is that a maintainer needs to ask his users "but which version of my app are you using?". 
This means that the developers won't know which binaries of their app are being used, either theirs or the ones you create
