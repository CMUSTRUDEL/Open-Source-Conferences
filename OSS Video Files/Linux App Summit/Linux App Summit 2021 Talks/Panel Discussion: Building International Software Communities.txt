Q&A


1. What do the panel think about creating or joining a LUG? (Linux User Groups)

2. What do you think about using languages other than English in FOSS communities for user support, development, and other purposes? I have encouraged this but ironically got pushback from people whose native language isn't English.

3. How is the Open Source software trying to call out for companies so that they are more attracted to use non proprietary software? Also, how is Open Source handling the demands that most of proprietary software can handle? Many times we want to use open source software but they just can't keep up with the features of proprietary software, therefore, companies will pay for the proprietary software instead!

4. What success story can you share on a self sustaining project that you have been involved with or influenced?
