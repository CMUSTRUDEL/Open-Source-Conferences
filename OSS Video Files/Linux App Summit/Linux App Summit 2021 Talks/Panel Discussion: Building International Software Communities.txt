Q&A


1. What do the panel think about creating or joining a LUG? (Linux User Groups)

2. What do you think about using languages other than English in FOSS communities for user support, development, and other purposes? I have encouraged this but ironically got pushback from people whose native language isn't English.

3. How is the Open Source software trying to call out for companies so that they are more attracted to use non proprietary software? Also, how is Open Source handling the demands that most of proprietary software can handle? Many times we want to use open source software but they just can't keep up with the features of proprietary software, therefore, companies will pay for the proprietary software instead!

4. What success story can you share on a self sustaining project that you have been involved with or influenced?

okay well

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,280
let's not waste our time and get started

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,400
thank you

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,880
thank you very much for being here

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:19,279
i see regina has finally joined regina

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,279
could you please rejoin the audio for me

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,160
today we're going to ask some questions

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,800
and get some answers

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,560
um i think it's probably easiest if we

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,600
go alphabetically

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:38,160
in uh name order first name

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:42,000
just to to make things a little simple

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,680
so to start off i'd love

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,600
if each of you could give a brief

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,000
introduction of yourselves

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,719
uh obviously we know your names but let

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,160
us know

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,960
your name maybe we're pronouncing it

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,360
incorrectly where you're currently based

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,199
uh which open source projects and

00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,079
communities you're affiliated with

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,960
and maybe just a little highlight from

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,960
the pandemic

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,880
did i stop okay

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,640
so my name is anita cooper and i'm

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,960
currently based in berlin

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,320
and i'm working with kde as a marketing

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,520
consultant

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,799
and i think um the highlight for me for

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,920
pandemic was that i

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,119
moved to berlin and as kde i think it

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,400
didn't change much

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,640
but yes we'd have more online events

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,640
now

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,360
thanks please go ahead

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,240
yes so um hello everyone uh first of all

based also in berlin

00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,399
germany but not only i would be

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,479
i would be um living in in asia of

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,119
course also of the the pandemic i've

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,280
been

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,840
here for for a while already so i'm

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,360
associated with

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,360
asia i'm one of the founders of the

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,239
organization as well so this is a

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,959
singapore

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,360
based organization that developed open

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,640
source uh software and hardware

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,480
and i will go to try to foster

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,120
open source um movement in asia

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,520
and uh beside development of software

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,920
and hardware we also organized um

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,360
events similar to this we had the frost

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,959
asia annual

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,560
summit we run a lot of online programs

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,239
to show people how to code and

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,080
contribute to various open source

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:46,400
projects

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,400
the pandemic i think is

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,560
impact everywhere everyone around the

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,440
world and also

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,040
of course like um the frost asia

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,159
community

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,319
uh in several ways so um

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,319
just three weeks ago our one of our call

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,159
maintainer passed away in india when he

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,440
was only 26

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:09,920
and um you know the situation in that is

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,599
so bad and there are majority of our

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,879
contributors coming from india and of

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,920
course it influenced

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,640
the development of of the projects the

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,800
people

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:23,519
really just they uh they struggling to

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,280
to survive so um being able to

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,360
contribute to open source it's really

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,640
difficult now for for developers coming

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,519
from of that

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,159
region we're doing hardware development

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,879
the production of hardware significant

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,519
significantly uh slow downs due to the

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,760
pandemic disruptive of components

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,519
uh cheap production it's also the

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,000
pricing also increased really high for

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,239
us

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,840
like for organization that or that

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,239
develop open source hardware

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,120
so a lot of things happening uh at the

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,920
moment

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,280
um very challenging in order to to

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,239
sustain um

00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,360
the community but i'm i'm glad that we

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,480
still be able to um

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,720
to to stay uh together and continue what

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,080
we

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,480
are doing similar to uh to the linux app

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,120
um

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,720
summit we run our first asia summit

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,479
online this year

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:20,560
as well so this is uh some of the

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,560
highlights related to the pandemic

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,440
well thank you it looks like we lost

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,960
your video but while you're figuring

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,360
that out and well why don't you tell us

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,759
about yourself

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,360
yeah sure thank you alison nice to meet

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,880
you everyone

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:40,320
i am from mexico i i am living at the

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,440
sakataka city is placed at north of the

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,880
country

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:48,400
and we have i am working with

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:52,400
with open source for about

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:55,040
25 years my professional career i was

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:59,440
starting working with the unix system so

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:04,000
the evolution to linux to open source

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:07,520
was very natural for me so uh

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,800
here at mexico we are working we have

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:14,000
nine years working to to a strange

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,440
uh false community around all the in the

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,479
country of mexico

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:22,479
we we have a very important community

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:26,000
named the open source lab in spanish is

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,800
laboratories because my shirt is lapseal

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,680
laboratory

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,520
software say is the the name of

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,600
community of our community

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:38,479
right now we have 65 university

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,039
restraint in the the community open

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,400
source

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,240
around the around the different

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,240
universities as you see

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,800
is academy as a community of academics

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,400
of universities working together to to

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,280
create to develop

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,680
innovation projects every project all

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,639
the

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,080
technology is exclusively we are working

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,199
with false technologies

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,400
so we are uh confirming a very strong

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,680
community using development develop

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,240
develop and adopting the use of open

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,120
source

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,720
open source software here in mexico open

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,639
source lab community

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:21,199
is working develop development uh

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:24,240
maybe around 50 51 52

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:28,240
projects every every six months

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,120
with a 120 students from the

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,400
university working to develop this kind

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,639
of project so

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,600
this i think is a very very important

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,240
community

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,600
strengthening the the devos community

together with

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,319
google open source community so we are

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,280
trying to align

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,400
with very important leaders about the

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,720

okay yeah so my name is regina and um

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,680
i'm

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,599
from nigeria but i'm currently living in

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,599
sweden

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:03,280
and i moved over to sweden basically

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,759
during the pandemic

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,400
so there's uh quite a whole lot of

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,919
changes

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,800
uh i'm about the member for the gnome

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,919
foundation

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,360
and i'm also part of the

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:21,360
founding members for gnome africa uh

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:24,479
i think uh basically uh

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,240
how did the pandemic affect us uh yeah

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,680
it did in several ways

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,280
um first we were supposed to have the

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,440
first events in africa for the first

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,000
time for ground foundation

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,839
but then um it happened at the time when

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,360
the pandemic just started so we had to

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,080
postpone it

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,039
and so we had a little bit of um

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,240
enthusiasm

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,880
that went um you know not um

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,240
a bit reduced because everyone was

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,720
anticipating the event

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,320
and you know having to introduce gnome

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,680
um to africa for the first time

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,399
just what we all were looking out for

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,720
but then um we you know we compensated

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,959
that by having a virtual event

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,720
um towards the end of the year which is

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,920
quite um successful we had quite a

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,040
number of people

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,880
attend the event um right now

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,080
basically what we're trying to do is to

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,440
see how we

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,399
can get into um

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,990
african universities mainly um by having

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,480
the gnome

00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,160
[Music]

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,519
university outreach initiative in africa

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,519
universities for the first time it's

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,480
quite a very big

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,920
um project for us at the moment because

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,600
you know uh

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:36,160
um open source in africa is um

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,760
still at its developing stage and still

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,920
so much of introduction to do

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,880
and all of that but then we are quite

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,120
excited that

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,279
we have quite a number of um

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,160
applications and we

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,800
are looking forward to see um how um

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,000
glom foundation will be embraced around

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,040
universities in africa so i think that's

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,920
basically

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,800
um how the pandemic has affected us um

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,079
as a people

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,360
um yeah i think um africa is a very

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,880
unique place

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,880
so um motivations

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,800
come in different forms as to what you

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,680
have in other parts of the world

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,120
and so the way we treat events here

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,240
basically is different and the way

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,560
people get motivated to want to do um

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,160
partake in open source also is a little

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,120
different

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,640
so we are now we're trying to look at um

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,399
other aspects

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,320
of um introducing people and you know

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,279
possibly running more projects that is

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,320
um

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,240
um going to be possible like a little

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,600
bit of compensation for the for the work

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,760
they're going to be doing open source to

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,760
bringing more people into the project

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,720
for groom foundation and so we are

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,320
basically at the developing stage

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,920
and we're learning on the go at the

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,640
moment um you know

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,440
trying to find out more of what people

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,000
require

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,399
and how we could best feed contributors

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,920
coming from african-american projects

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,760
and i think that's basically where we

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,440
are at the moment uh thank you alison

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,320
once again and again apologies that i

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,800
can't

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,560
do my video at the moment and i hope the

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,360
background is not noisy like uh

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,560
i discussed okay oh thank you that's

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,720
okay

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,760
all right well thank you regina it was

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,720
great to hear

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,160
um let's go on to mustafa and then to

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,720
tomas

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,720
mista please introduce yourself uh let

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,079
us know where you're currently based

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,160
which open source projects and

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,160
communities you're affiliated with

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,279
and if you don't mind provide a little

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,800
highlight uh

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,680
something that's happened in your life

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,959
since the pandemic or your communities

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,959
live since the pandemic

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,839
you'll need to unmute yourself

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:57,839
hey maybe tomas would you mind sharing

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,839
with us

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:06,399
hello hi welcome

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:10,000
hello hello let me just remove this

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:13,760
thingy from my hair just a sec

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,440
so hi i am thomas i am from the kde

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,320
project

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,360
and i do think that open source is on my

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,079
life for almost

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,360
20 years and i do program professionally

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:27,920
for open source on 16 of those years

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,920
there is one thing that i try to do as

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,920
much as programming that is to create

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,200
communities and try to make people

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,920
also do things on open source so

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,079
my wife hates me because of that because

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,920
usually i take my vacations

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:48,399
sorry going to universities and teaching

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,800
how to start contributing to open source

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,240
i've been doing this in brazil for the

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,519
past 10 years and i'm

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,639
also a google summer of code mentor for

00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,079
most of those years

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,560
um usually i got in contact

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,639
with professors on universities i talk

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,399
to them i ask them if they like open

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,079
source or if they don't or if they

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,440
actually know open source because one

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,440
thing that i discovered that's

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,959
most of the universities at least inside

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,360
of brazil

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,360
they don't actually understand what the

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,760
hell open source means they think that

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,800
it's

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,200
just software that it's free but it's

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,920
not

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,800
that i mean with no open source we know

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:30,079
that it's much more than that

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,880
and then i go there and i talk to them

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,839
and then

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,399
usually they allow me to do a 40 hour

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,200
course

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,000
for free i've never charged it for those

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,480
with the

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,560
only intention of training the students

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,079
on the tools that we use professionally

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:49,519
and how to contribute to something

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:52,639
and this has been how i created the

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,720
kg brazil um

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,360
when i say that i created the kd brazil

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,680
there was a kd brazil before me but it

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,720
was

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,440
three members for five or six years

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,720
as soon as i started to do that we grew

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,079
to almost

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:11,600
50 members and most of them

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:14,959
are contributors some with codes we have

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:18,720
now around 12 contributors with code

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:20,720
but we have way way

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,199
more than that contributors for

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,399
translations and ux

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,279
for more projects than kd because it's

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,279
not because i

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,639
am inside of the kde projects that i

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,920
will only focus

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:36,800
on kd software so so

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,880
i've also pushed people through genome

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,839
foundation i've also pushed people

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:45,120
to mono and i really

00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:48,800
like how i

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,760
am how do i say i really like the things

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,399
that are happening

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,000
because i have the time to go and do

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,600
those things

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,120
um this year i got i actually want to

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,920
talk to regina because of this

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,440
uh i got a student from maputo in

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,279
mozambique

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,880
asking me if i could go there and do a

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,800
course in africa and i said

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,720
of course i just need a few days of

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,360
vacation and i

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,160
i am not even going to try to charge

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:19,199
because it would be my pleasure to teach

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,639
for people outside of brazil

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,600
and um then i also got contacts from a

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,560
teacher

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,560
in vancouver and only because of corona

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,600
i'm not doing those things this year but

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,000
as soon as corona

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,160
ends i'm going there and i'm gonna try

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,480
to start communities

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,519
not waiting for them for that because

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,079
i've waited

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,920
for someone to teach me how to start an

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,560
open source for a long time

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,839
and it took me almost four years with

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,320
fears that people would

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,440
laugh about my codes with fears that i

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,199
would be judged

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,480
so if you have somebody that already

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,519
knows how to

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,240
open source take the time

00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,560
go to universities talk to teachers talk

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,360
to students and see if the students

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,720
are willing to use open source or they

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,040
are

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,839
as their conclusion projects because

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,560
i've seen that

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,440
this makes them quite happy to have more

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,279
people

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,800
looking at the codes and it makes them

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,399
happy because it would be

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,720
a code that matters because usually

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,120
from what i saw as soon as the student

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,000
finishes his conclusion projects

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,000
he belongs it

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:33,440
so this makes everything better

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,720
and this is how i am trying to create

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,560
communities um

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:41,759
as soon as corona is africa vancouver

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,440
and also university in india and nick i

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,320
think i talked to and you can choose

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,199
somebody else

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,399
about going to the early ic and doing

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:52,560
the same thing there

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,959
so yes this is my approach on building

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,240
communities never waiting for them to

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,160
want to start one

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,839
going there and pushing the communities

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,279
for them

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:06,799
that's awesome well if

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:08,799
katie brazil has any any um

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,959
example i'm sure the upcoming

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:14,559
communities will be just as thriving

i'm very sorry mustafa your your

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:31,200
connection

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,200
seems to be breaking up quite heavily

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,120
yes

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,160

okay um let's

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,799

myself i can find a better connection

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,080
uh and and jump back into the

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,640
conversation

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,640
i'd love to move on to our our first

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:52,720
real question of the panel

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:56,080
uh digging deep into the topic

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,720
uh the question is

00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,679
which tomas started to answer already

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,320
actually

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,240
how did you start your community and

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,360
what were some of the challenges you

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,600
faced

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,240
is there any advice you would like to

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,880
give to someone who is starting a new

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,880
community

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:19,520
oh yes don't

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,559
try to do a linux distribution we have

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:25,200
already too many linux distributions

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,840
pick one and try to have the software

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:31,280
because we do have

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:34,640
um for instance on gnome

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,440
and on kde that are big communities

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,039
i think we are we both are the combined

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,000
biggest community on free software that

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,080
there is

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,520
we have software's that have zero

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,799
maintainers

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,799
so instead of trying to create your new

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:51,200
linux distro that will take the world by

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,360
storm

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,880
pick a small application that is

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,320
abandoned

00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,880
and try to help try to make it better

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,559
with that view you have people helping

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,440
you choose starts

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:07,840
and things will be not as hard as if you

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,720
are doing everything alone

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,679
try to find professors and people that

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:17,039
are within the community already

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:19,600
try to push the idea towards your

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,600
study group or your university usually

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,640
they are open sometimes they are not

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,840
really onto it

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:29,280
but usually it's because they don't know

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,679
and do not wait because there is

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,720
nothing around there or there is no work

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:38,080
based on open source near where you live

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,880
because nowadays the work on it

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,679
is global you can work whenever you want

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:48,960
wherever you want

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:51,440
basically that and don't be shy

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,039
it's important not to be shy yeah if you

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,840
are shy you are not going to talk to

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,760
people

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,679
if you are not going to talk to people

00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,520
nobody will look at your codes your

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,200
mistakes will be still the same mistakes

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,120
that you did as a student because there

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,919
is nobody to correct you

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,039
and don't be scared on people correcting

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,080
your code i mean

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,600
i have 16 years of experience writing

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,400
source codes

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,080
sometimes my students they find theirs

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,120
and they fix my codes and i

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:22,799
am so glad because people fixing my code

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,799
means that i don't need to work on that

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,640
thank you well i saw some head mods from

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,159
manuel

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,640
and and from monica on should i comment

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,760
um anika would you like to follow up

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,159
with that

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,080
i know you are doing lots of work with

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,400
jumpstarting the kitty network maybe you

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,280
can pull in some experience from there

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,679
sure so we recently started kde network

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,240
but

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,039
i think it has been very successful and

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,799
in india

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,039
kerala there were a lot of things

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,679
happening but we had no idea about it

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,080
actually

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,799
so i feel that starting a new community

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,360
is about

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,720
finding the right people actually if you

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,480
find the right people

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,720
you can actually start a community and

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,400
they are if they are dedicated to it

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,159
because i feel you know if they do it

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,000
for maybe you know just

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,679
six months and they just leave you

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
there's no point because you want people

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,720
with

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,240
long-term commitment because and also

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,760
not just one person that's what we

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,760
decided for kde network

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,520
because if you just have one person that

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,440
person cannot start the community

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,120
you need at least four to five people so

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,679
that you know if somebody is busy

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,520
the other person can replace that so in

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,960
india what we did is that we have around

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,440
five people over there

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,760
and just thomas as thomas said that you

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,600
know you need to connect to universities

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,120
but you need someone who can actually

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,159
you know understand the language of the

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,120
community

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,720
i'm saying about not only the language

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,919
in terms of language but what they

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,880
actually how they

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,799
feel their way of communicating because

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,840
that's how you can enter the community

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:53,120
like um also about the nigeria thing

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,240
which thomas mentioned

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,520
so i feel that if the people are not

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,320
if you're not connected to them you

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:04,720
cannot actually pursue the community

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:07,039
um also i think when kde started in 1996

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,799
main thing which kde was lacking was

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,720
diversity and now we have

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,400
kd network in india and hopefully we are

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,400
starting in china as well

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,039
so i feel that you know this diversity

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,440
diversity will actually create

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,279
harmony and it will bring a lot of a lot

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,279
more people in the community

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,440
and the other point which i feel is that

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,880
you need to accept the community

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,960
not only technical person and

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,960
non-technical as well so you need to

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,039
create that awareness that we are just

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,520
not about technical people

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,520
but also non-technical also and sorry

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,080
for the mass because i'm actually in

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,400
hamburg

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,400
at the central city station so

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:50,080
to be safe i'm sorry for sure absolutely

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,039
thank you anika hong and then manuel

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,400
would you like to

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:59,200
take it on yeah sure

00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:03,120
well as a teacher of university

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:06,799
i am i understand absolutely

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:09,520
the the the words or thomas

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,080
we are trying we are the the open source

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,679
lab

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:16,159
is a is located at

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,960
zacatecas state science a technology

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,000
council

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,720
like a government state so we have we

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,240
have from the

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,159
the council the the approach of the

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,760
the close collaboration with all the

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,880
universities of the state

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:34,080
so we have we we was

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,520
have three challenge to start this big

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,120
community right now

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:42,080
the first challenge is to have the truth

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,880
of the universities beginning with the

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,640
teachers

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:49,600
and going with the students because

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,640
there are the open source language the

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,080
open source

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:58,159
philosophy here in mexico is very low

00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:00,320
so we we want we we works to try to

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,440
get the the truth of the students and

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,440
the teachers

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:08,880
the second challenge was uh when when we

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,120
had when we we got

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,880
the truth of the universities teachers

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,400
and students

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,240
we works to go to a public

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,760
and the dependence of government to

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,559
private companies

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,200
to have the truth to develop projects

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,760
around

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,400
open source technologies so but right

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,080
now

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:32,799
we have working to reach

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,400
to allied with big big leaders like

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:38,159
genome

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:42,400
i was the user finished genome

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:45,760
engagement challenge from genome so

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:49,520
this was an amazing experience for me

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:53,039
because we have more of a 150

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:56,320
projects around the from the maybe

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:59,840
50 60 countries around the world so

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,880
i i i was see the the very important

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,919
philosophy

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,200
of of open source and other noted

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,320
countries

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:11,840
than other continents i i

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,640
have the pleasure that i i was getting

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,760
i was placed i was being in brazil

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,760
sometimes

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:22,799
i was in enforce i was in porto alegre

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:26,799
the community is big big community

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:29,679
but the more important

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:31,360
the the really the the really matters

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,760
around brazil for me

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,919
is the philosophy around open source so

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,120
it's it's a very very big

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:42,720
uh how do you see

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:45,760
um it's a very important

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,799
goal for us to work to

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:52,559
to create this this philosophy around

00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:55,360
open source here in mexico uh and

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,159
i mean like like i'm a genomic member

00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,880
right now

00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:03,919
i am working specifically to works

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,240
to estrange this community so we have

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,399
a lot of students very talented students

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,240
around the open source community

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,600
uh the open source lab community around

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,640
the around country

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:17,360
and i i i think we have

00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,640
all the talent to start to work we are

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,039
working to develop

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,080
a lot of projects all the projects is

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,640
developed

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,919
with the open source technologies but

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,440
the next step

00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:31,679
is to work to take this talent to make

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,960
a very important contributors to

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,279
projects to big

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,480
projects uh the open source projects

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:40,000
like genome like

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,760
ide like maybe google

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,279
there are a lot of there are a lot of

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,960
leaders there are a lot of projects

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,320
there are a lot of strategies around

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,679
open source projects

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,919
so we are working to to take

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,039
these young talents from universities

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,960
and go to these

00:28:53,039 --> 00:29:00,240
big projects to make a more important

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,320
a community of contributors and and

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,200
right now in mexico i forget that the

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,480
last the last

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:10,000
chance the pandemic we have

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:13,120
a very very an amazing surprise

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,320
because every month every six months i

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:20,480
be before the pandemics we we are we

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:23,200
we was work with uh 140

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,679
students every six months but our

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,799
biggest surprises

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:31,120
the when when we go to the pandemic to

00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:34,399
home office to work from home

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,840
to this this kind of very complex

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:39,200
situation

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:42,000
the people the students follow

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,120
coming to the open source lab a working

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,279
home office

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,279
and we don't have uh

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,799
less less students every six months i we

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,120
have the

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:57,360
the same production we have the same

00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,720
community is very important for us

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,279
and the students is ready ready to work

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,480
in this new model this is very important

00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,600
for us

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,880
thank you thank you huang would you like

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,480
to answer a question

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:15,360
uh just in case you need it uh

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,919
how did you start your community what

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,799
were some

00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,399
challenges you faced at faust asia and

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,960
what's some advice that you give to

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:27,200
someone starting a new community

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:30,799
yeah uh yes so i hope you can hear me

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:34,559
uh okay good so um how did i start for

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:36,880
asia so uh back in 2009

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,799
so at that time like the open source

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,720
definition the idea of open source is

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:43,120
very new for a country like vietnam i'm

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,279
originally from vietnam by the way

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,320
and i also did not study computer

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,720
science myself

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,240
but during university i got involved in

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,600
the linux user room

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,600
and i got a lot of mentorship from the

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,840
people from community and i soon

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,480
realized the opportunities uh with open

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,320
source

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,600
in developing even countries like

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,720
southeast asia

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,559
getting access to um to education is

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,519
also challenging and people don't get

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,760
the same

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,960
kind of education system that you get

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,159
from from the west

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,960
you know and also very limited people

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,760
have asset

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,799
internet at that time so we see that um

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,799
with open source

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,880
uh there is a huge opportunity for

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,080
people where they can collaborate where

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,840
they can learn and also

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,360
the best thing is that they can connect

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,640
with people from all over the world

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,840
which is something

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,159
that really harm for people in in that

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,880
particular

00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,320
region so what i did in the beginning my

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,360
partner and i

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,480
uh he has many years um working in open

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,960
source

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,640
he originally come from germany moved to

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,760
asia

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,559
in the past we started to uh to think of

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,480
uh

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,240
creating a lot of platform where people

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,440
can meet can you change ideas so we

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,919
started the first

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,760
event where we invite people from from

00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,000
europe from the us to come over

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,039
some we have gnome actually we hosted

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
the gnome uh

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:05,519
asia in 2009 in ho chi minh city and

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,480
this that was the first

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,080
open source event uh ever in in vietnam

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,840
we got a lot of um

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,480
attendees a lot of interest from the

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,480
community people come

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,320
like each and the idea to share more

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,559
about different tools and more what is

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,559
open source and after the first event

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:26,159
people started to get together

00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:28,399
so over um more than like 11

00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,240
years we we join the events every year

00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,320
and when people meet people get together

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,399
so their new idea coming

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,679
so over the years of false asia was not

00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,360
an event anymore

00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,519
uh during the event people exchanged

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,880
ideas they developed new projects so we

00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,760
now

00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,760
hosted um a lot of uh open source

00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,000
project on our first asia github

00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,519
we have uh about um four thousand

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,399
contributors in

00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,279
in our organization a network of thirty

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,480
thousand people

00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:56,240
even though from the beginning it was

00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,440
only two people so we developed a

00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,519
various um

00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,720
open source software we have event

00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,760
management we have

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,880
um search engine we also look into ai

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,039
technology and i

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,799
mentioned in the beginning we developed

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:12,240
an open source hardware um

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,399
product which is the pocket science lab

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,279
that enable

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,840
students to learn electronics in a more

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,519
um

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:24,080
interesting and portable way yeah

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,240
uh so that was uh the journey i'm not

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,840
gonna spend so much time talking about

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,440
how we're getting here today but what

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,159
i'm want to say is

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,799
a lot of uh challenging challenges that

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,000
we face

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:37,840
along the way but um one thing that help

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,880
us to continue that if you believe in

00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,880
something continue

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,480
doing something like you you perceive

00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,200
with your idea um

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,679
no matter is it difficult challenging uh

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,080
we

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,799
we will still try to connect with people

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,000
and try to make

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:53,279
um try to make things happen and one of

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,600
the biggest

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,399
biggest challenges of asia and i think

00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,159
with many

00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:02,000
other open source projects and

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,919
communities as well is the resources

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,760
we do not have a big company who who

00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,799
backing us right sustainability is

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,399
always a big issue

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,720
how can you manage to continue to

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,159
develop uh the projects and

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,079
also the question of getting

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,879
contributors on on board

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,679
um and i already mentioned earlier about

00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,839
like how to

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,280
to try to engage different people you

00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:22,000
need to speak their language you need to

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,399
be open

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,159
and and and embrace diversity and it's

00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:29,359
also very similar to

00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:32,639
um due to the fossil community and

00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:34,000
i think um lorena mentioned in

00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,000
in africa people have different

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,359
motivation why they get engaged into the

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,040
open source community

00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:42,560
it's also similar to uh to to asia what

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,119
are people motivation we need to

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,839
understand to be more people motivation

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,480
and so when you come to developing

00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:52,480
country all you want is to do to have a

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,480
stable life to take care of your family

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,119
we don't have a healthcare system here

00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,200
um like in germany's or everywhere so we

00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,119
need to understand what people need

00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,200
and show them the opportunity they can

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,920
get with with open source

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,280
um building the trust in the community

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,640
so this is something that we

00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,359
uh believe that will um that works over

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,320
the year

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:16,400
and enable people to um to do more

00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,560
things enable people to be independent

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,480
enable people to build skill that can

00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,240
that they can market themselves in the

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,480
job market enable them

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,240
to earn a living to sustain their life

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,640
so that they can continue to contribute

00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,800
to

00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,560
the open source and we need to be

00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,960
prepared that people will leave at one

00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,760
point so how you can get new generation

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,920
to contribute

00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,440
is about what uh manuel mentioned

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,000
earlier uh the

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,880
education so what university was for

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,880
several years

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,000
uh for asia connect with university in

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,839
vietnam university

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,079
in singapore india we have several

00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:51,760
workshops in across india

00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:53,760
we have hackathons also in here and

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,520
china we work together with qingquan

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,079
university in china

00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,680
so it's really important to work with

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,000
the local

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,760
institutions and i just want to add one

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,680
more point if you are thinking of

00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,240
studying a community

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,200
and i want to to to reference what

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,599
thomas said as

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,040
earlier don't just start a community you

00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,599
think of what is your goal

00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,440
maybe it can be achieved already by

00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,079
being part of the existing community

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,440
it's not an

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,079
easy task to do so uh if you want to

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,640
foster

00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,240
um some there's so many projects out

00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,320
there that you can contribute to

00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,599
if you really have a specific goal that

00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,920
you want to achieve and no

00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,640
other existing communities can satisfy

00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,200
that goal

00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,320
then think of uh like to track something

00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,119
but it's not an

00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,520
easy start starting something easy but

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:44,240
manage how to sustain is really

00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,040
difficult yeah and i think that there

00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,680
are a lot of

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,400
also a good example if you want to to

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,079
look at so

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,880
um here we met like a lot of people

00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:55,119
mentioned the gnome foundation

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,359
as an organization in asia like us we

00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,119
also be able to succeed for

00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:01,280
several years and continue to grow we

00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,920
have our best practices available on the

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,000
blog

00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,480
on the website and we always are happy

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,520
to to exchange and share more

00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:13,119
ideas so our members are active also on

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:15,920
on gito if you want to to find it

00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,640
yes thank you maybe you can share any of

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,800
those links

00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:21,040
in the chat or even the shared notes

00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,240
that would be very helpful

00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,960
um regina would you like to answer the

00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,760
current question

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,760
how did you start your community what

00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,720
were some challenges you faced

00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,440
and what's some advice you would give

00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,839
yeah sure

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,960
i think uh it's quite um exciting to

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,320
listen to everyone

00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,240
and um um they've been quite a number of

00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,240
good points that were made

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:49,200
so actually the grammar figure started

00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:52,400
uh 2019 basically

00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,040
i started when i joined the dignum

00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,400
foundation

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:59,920
i had been lecturing um linux um

00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,400
for over seven years uh before joining

00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,440
um

00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,480
the gnome foundation so i was uh already

00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,880
uh you know i understood the linux also

00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,599
finding people that have the same

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,040
um that worked on the same platform that

00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,480
i've been you know using to teach for a

00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,040
very long time was quite

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,880
exciting for me but then i realized that

00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,320
when i came in i was only introduced to

00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,240
i think about two africans

00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:27,280
uh which basically did not at the time

00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:30,480
uh um was not a very um

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,400
good uh um introduction for me um in the

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,280
sense that we're a few

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,960
and i wanted them to have more africans

00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,880
into the gnome foundation

00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,560
uh because i know it would you know not

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,720
just for diversity

00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,160
but also to you know bringing you know

00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,920
diverse ideas um

00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,440
into the community and so that's why

00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,560
that's what actually formed

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,680
the gnome africa community and so at the

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,240
time we started

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,000
i think instead of first day i i spoke

00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,880
about the gnome desktop

00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,599
in an event and i was quite um excited

00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,040
to see

00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:05,040
the um interest that people add

00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,480
for the gnome desktop and you know i

00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,839
just did physically something like a

00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,800
practical

00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:11,680
workshop in the event and i showed

00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,359
people how

00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,760
it was easy to work with the gnome

00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:19,920
desktop um on the linux um

00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:22,640
um um on the linux uh

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,359
platform basically and we we know we got

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,920
a lot of

00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:27,119
people that was interested um to want to

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,400
be part of the gnome

00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,920
uh foundation and i think that's

00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,960
basically what started the gnome africa

00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,200
community

00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,480
and so at the beginning we had people of

00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,240
interest

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,720
that came in but then we had people of

00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:41,119
interest with no with less

00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,480
idea about what open sources in general

00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:45,119
and about basically

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,839
what gnome is and what gnome foundation

00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,040
is

00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:51,599
so for for us at the time it was

00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,520
more of introducing people to open cells

00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,880
introducing people to work no means

00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,200
and i would say first technical

00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,079
community is being very clear and direct

00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,920
about the

00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,280
road map of the community you're trying

00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,880
to build

00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,960
and the way the community you're trying

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:08,400
to create is going to

00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,960
so gloom africa is definitely a branch

00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,640
of the gnome foundation so we we ensured

00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,480
that we were clear enough about the

00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,920
goals of globe foundation

00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,920
and what green africa is doing is

00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,720
basically extending

00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,200
the community into you know into africa

00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,920
but

00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,520
we are all achieving the same goal so we

00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,560
we're always you know having to tell

00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,640
you know people who are coming to the

00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,920
community um your contribution

00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,520
contributions to open source you know

00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,400
basically it's a

00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:36,079
contribution on the ground um

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,440
maintaining ground projects and normal

00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,800
obviously software's that's basically

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,000
what it was

00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:45,359
but then um um another thing is um

00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,200
we um had people um

00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,480
we took people the way that they had so

00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,599
basically if you if you're not in

00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,440
technology for example

00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,280
you know a computer science person and

00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,040
you just have interests um

00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,880
in open source we where you know we're

00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,319
open to helping you grow

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,319
and basically telling you what the

00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,760
community is about so so let me iterate

00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:04,720
by saying that

00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,240
um the the foundation community you

00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,079
would know um

00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,760
i've not really had much faith in africa

00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,319
you know from onset

00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,040
so we had so many things to do as to you

00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:16,000
know

00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,800
having people to feel part of the

00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,800
community and

00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:23,440
you know feel um kind of kind of um

00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,119
comfortable accepted uh acceptance

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,319
basically in the community

00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,440
uh so um what we did again uh basically

00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:33,200
was to always show

00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,040
people um appreciation for the little

00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,599
for every contribution that they make um

00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,599
so we used mostar social media platform

00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:42,000
as a means to you know call out the

00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,400
names of those that know that helped us

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
um to maybe social media or contributed

00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,880
to the globe foundation project one way

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,520
or the other

00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,240
that allowed people to stay more in the

00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,160
community

00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,920
you know and has been able to create a

00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,720
kind of a level of um

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,319
sustainability for the community um what

00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,359
is the challenge is basically i would

00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:01,599
say is

00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:03,280
motivation in africa is different from

00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,240
every part of the world i i think we

00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,000
should say that

00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,359
and so if you need people to come to to

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,680
contribute to open cells people have

00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:10,880
real

00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,119
issue real problems so we need to look

00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,640
at

00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,319
projects basically that are going to

00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,640
help people

00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,520
compensate them for their contribution

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,160
and so

00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,760
that's for i think for some time slowed

00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,880
us down a little bit

00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:27,280
um so because uh we needed to do

00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,720
begin to do stuff that um begin to do

00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,560
projects something like outreach you

00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,319
know something that would help people

00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,520
you know gain the type of motivation

00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,800
they need that would help them go

00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,720
through the normal life and

00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,920
pay bills at the same time contribute to

00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:42,319
open source

00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,839
so right now um we are launching into

00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,680
universities in africa we just started

00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:47,680
the application process basically

00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,359
and we're quite excited at the numbers

00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,040
of people that are willing to be

00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:53,119
ambassadors for gnome in their

00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,880
universities um and we're looking to

00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,119
work out a way that would you know

00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,160
you know have to you know create a

00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,760
platform where they would

00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,920
understand what the gnome foundation is

00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,800
so again it for us basically in

00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,200
the community is more of continuing to

00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,000
show

00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,200
people the roadmap to the community how

00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,359
do you join

00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,040
how do you contribute what is the

00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,480
benefit of your contributions

00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,040
what are the different aspects you can

00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,319
contribute to it's maybe code it may be

00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,319
translation

00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:22,000
you know we just always have to do this

00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:23,359
over and over again to let people know

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,200
and it may never be

00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,720
because they're just starting um it

00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,200
might never be enough at the moment we

00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:32,000
have to

00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:34,079
keep doing this um as regards to um

00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,920
another thing i think that we did last

00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:38,560
year that happened well

00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,319
uh i don't have i don't have like a full

00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:44,000
update on that but i can talk about

00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:47,040
what um the scalable onboarding project

00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,480
basically started by three uh and some

00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,119
other members um

00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,680
inclusive me uh but i've not really been

00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,040
um

00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,280
there for for quite some time

00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,520
necessarily located so basically

00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,480
it's like uh you know creating a kind of

00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,359
a a

00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,160
platform a matrix that helps people to

00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:04,240
basically

00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,440
on board newcomers to onboard you know

00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,920
properly into the

00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,520
uh not just gnome as all but basically

00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,720
open source projects

00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:14,560
and and this is a there's another way to

00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,160
kind of help new people newcomers

00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:19,280
basically to community you know

00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,800
open source community uh so another

00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,720
thing that is very important that i'm

00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,319
you know quite um

00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,400
let me just do a passionate about the

00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:28,800
sustainability of um the project

00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,680
basically and how well the project can

00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,800
scale

00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:35,599
um above comment members um

00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,000
to um you know new contributors that are

00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:39,200
coming

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,960
up so um one of the the initiative

00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,480
um that we're driving again it's the

00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,800
university nation which basically what

00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,240
one way we can scale easily in africa

00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,839
and we can you know bring sustainability

00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:51,119
into the project and have more

00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:54,480
newer people join um the community

00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:56,800
so would that be uh we do we have

00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,160
challenges at the moment or yes we we

00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,000
have we have quite a number of times

00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,359
i've mentioned a few

00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,200
and that's basically coming up with

00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:05,359
projects we hope that we

00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,800
there will be more projects like lgg

00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:09,280
where people can actually get

00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,800
you know um compensations um for open

00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,720
source contributions and in a more

00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,079
project like manual sales like the

00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,400
educational project that they do ignore

00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,079
which is basically a very good project

00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,760
but so we need more of those type of

00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,520
projects basically um

00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,880
in open source to help you know people

00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,200
from diverse or um

00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,480
you know communities join the open

00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,280
source and

00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,400
you know we get more um diverse ideas

00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,760
from that part

00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:36,480
another another um another

00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,400
um challenge we are having is basically

00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,680
having to

00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,720
um again um talk more and build a

00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,520
platform for open

00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:47,119
for um the how people can understand

00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,800
what gnome is about as you guys

00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,240
documentation and all of that

00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,520
so what we are doing in global africa at

00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,480
the moment is to try to create a

00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,079
platform

00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,160
more like a platform for group africa

00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:59,119
where we have like a very very

00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,480
um videos and pictures and pictorial

00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:03,200
sequence of how the gnome

00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,800
africa was created and the the

00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,440
contributions that different people from

00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,480
africa

00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:10,319
is making at the moment and um you know

00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,560
have that documented in a way that

00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:14,720
when a new african comes into community

00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,800
we can tilt them to

00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,480
the the platform and they could see the

00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,000
road maps and to be easy for them to

00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,920
basically come to come because

00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,720
like um i think uh manual mentioned um

00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,400
gum foundation is big and kedy is big

00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:31,760
and so that there are

00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:35,599
quite a whole lot of um um

00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:37,520
um projects that can be contributed to

00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,440
and sometime one can get lost in the old

00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,040
road map and not knowing basically where

00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,359
to start and all of that so we're trying

00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,440
to make sure that um

00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:47,119
for the grammatical community we create

00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,760
a platform that allows people to easily

00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:49,599
come in

00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,880
and they don't get lost in the in the

00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,480
crowd and they

00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,480
they know where to start and you know

00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,280
they know who to reach out to

00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:59,200
and who to speak to at any point in time

00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:02,400
so i think that's basically where

00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,480
we are at the moment uh with um

00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,680
the issue with sustainability so i think

00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,160
overall in general

00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:10,000
is basically ensuring that you know

00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,079
we're making projects

00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,520
um that you know creates you know

00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,280
compensation we're enjoying that

00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,800
we're building several projects that

00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,319
allows people

00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:22,240
um to scale you know outside um

00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,400
the users i mean the people that started

00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,160
the foundation the community

00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,760
so new are people taking off challenges

00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,720
and all of that so these are basically

00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,920
what we are doing at the time we're

00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,200
doing that early

00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,960
um because we want to create the right

00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:38,160
foundation um

00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:41,200
for diplomatic community

00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:43,920
right thank you

00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,119
well uh mustafa let's see if we can get

00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,240
a little bit from you

00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:50,079
um let us know where your base uh which

00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,440
organization and projects you're

00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:55,359
affiliated with and

00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,359
and how did you start your community

00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:05,920
i see your mic is on and

00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,480
see we might not have mustafa here

00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,480
anymore

00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:15,520
okay unfortunately it looks like he did

00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:18,319
drop a call again

00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,040
i'd like to then introduce our next

00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:22,480
question

00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:24,319
being where are there opportunities for

00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:28,319
all of us to collaborate

00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:30,640
and increase users and revenue for linux

00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,640
apps

00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:38,240
i think um as a false community we are

00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,319
already collaborating really well

00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:42,160
but i feel that you know among us we

00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:45,520
should not have any competition

00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:48,640
it's not uh the real stats but i'm just

00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:50,079
saying uh assumed stats that the market

00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:53,119
share which proprietary

00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:55,200
uh softwares have is approximately 95

00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:56,400
and we might have only five percent so i

00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,160
think rather than you know

00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,240
competing for five percent we should all

00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,240
compete for the 95

00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,319
and we should support each other i feel

00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:07,440
in this uh journey

00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:09,280
and uh further today i think for revenue

00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,200
we can always do that rather than having

00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,440
a plain page of donations

00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,880
we create a small donation pages for

00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,440
example you know

00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,960
i worked my previous um background has

00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,040
been that i have worked for a lot of

00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,400
not-for-profit organizations so what

00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,319
they used to do was they had

00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,160
emotional impact so maybe you know

00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:28,160
creating a page where you can say that

00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,880
you donate for an educational app

00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,319
that is creating impact in a government

00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,280
school for example right now we are

00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:35,040
working with

00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,040
public schools in kerala and you have

00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:39,200
the stats that how poor they are

00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,160
so using those stats actually for more

00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,000
donations

00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:44,319
on your page can help you to increase

00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,520
revenue because we are not selling we

00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:47,040
are not we do not have

00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:49,200
advertisements we are not selling the

00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,640
data so we don't have any other way to

00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,480
actually earn the money

00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,559
this is the only way we can actually you

00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,119
know earn more donations and

00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:57,599
uh we need to create this the impact

00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,760
that

00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:01,040
no donation is a small donation maybe

00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,200
you know a lot of people think that

00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,960
i'm not a big company even individual

00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,160
donations are appreciated and we should

00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,800
you know somehow

00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,760
change our page and we should say that

00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,280
the individual

00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,359
these are the numbers of the individual

00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,200
contributors

00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:18,400
i think i've covered the points but if i

00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,839
missed anything let me know alison

00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,440
yeah so i don't want to say that i'd

00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:24,160
really like to point any

00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,200
any convention about competition inside

00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,359
the community

00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:29,200
so rather compete among each other work

00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:31,119
uh support each other and i think the

00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:33,440
most practical way how we can support

00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,040
each other is use each other product

00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,800
so if people in the open source

00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:39,040
community develop something

00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,400
use it and a lot of people go out there

00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,319
talk about open source but they don't

00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,480
actually use open source themselves

00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:46,800
yeah so if i organize an event i have an

00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,960
option i would use an open source uh

00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,160
system so it's nice that we just use big

00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,200
blue button here to

00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:55,200
um to run this event so i also

00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:57,760
like use instead of use photoshop that's

00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:59,680
your gim so how can we make sure that we

00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:02,240
use the uh

00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:05,119
um application that developed by our

00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:08,400
inner circle rather than um

00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:10,400
a variety software if we have an option

00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,440
and another thing that i want to to add

00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,720
here donation

00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:16,079
is one model of uh gending funding for

00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:19,200
open source project

00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,680
but this is not the only model yeah and

00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,400
also

00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:23,839
like commuting you also i mentioned

00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,640
about compensation

00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:27,040
uh compensation to uh to the developers

00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,680
so

00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,160
uh not everyone can afford to join uh

00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,559
the

00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:34,319
company can come and say the developer

00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:35,520
or not all the project will be accepted

00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:37,599
into our

00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,559
so we need to constantly think of

00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:42,400
different

00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:44,000
um commercialization model how people

00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:47,280
can earn an income

00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,800
there are a lot of research out there

00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,079
that are showing people can earn money

00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,319
by offer support

00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:53,280
around open source application so what

00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:56,800
we are missing

00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:59,280
in the ecosystem we develop on

00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:00,319
a software application a lot of people

00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,640
developers

00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:05,040
like thomas okay like to write code you

00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:07,599
spend a lot of time on make the

00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:09,920
super super nice application a lot of

00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:12,000
things related to very technical topic

00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,240
but one thing that we often missing is

00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,160
how to enable the user

00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:18,160
yeah and a lot of so when you try to

00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,160
convince a company to use an open source

00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,960
application they often ask for or do you

00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,440
have

00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:25,680
um offer to support the companies

00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,960
onboarding them or any um

00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,800
and maintaining of the service the

00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,720
nutrition of the service often opens up

00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:33,200
projects do not have

00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:35,839
a model where they can offer support to

00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:37,839
uh to companies or to more like to

00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:41,520
government sector for instance

00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:44,000
so um so anyway what i try to say

00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,880
is that uh helping each other by using

00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,839
each other uh

00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,800
product in inside the community and

00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:51,599
think of a way

00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:53,040
to commercialize your project offering

00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:55,920
support or

00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,559
or sell on the software as a service of

00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,800
course it

00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:00,400
is not so easy but we certainly need to

00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:03,599
think of a way how to

00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:07,119
um earn an income and also how to

00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:09,680
to to to pay our developers

00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,160
uh at the fossil for for example we we

00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,160
also

00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,319
constantly think of different models how

00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:17,359
to we can get the funding

00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:18,160
rather than depending on donation and we

00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:21,280
distribute

00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:22,640
uh um hardware over so the hybrid we

00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,640
produce completely open source but

00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:28,000
people do like buy the

00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:31,040
the hardware online uh to to

00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,800
to have the the project to sustain and

00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,319
uh one thing that i also feel a little

00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,559
bit sad so for instance

00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:39,040
uh even we understand how difficult it

00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:40,720
is to sustain an open source uh uh

00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,960
community a lot of us still really

00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:46,559
hesitate to pay for open source

00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,920
uh um product so uh people would okay so

00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:49,760
into the property uh

00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,240
software uh by default we have today but

00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:55,040
why do we have to pay for open source

00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:57,839
um and i think this is the mindset that

00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,839
that we need to change

00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:06,480
that's fantastic and i love how

00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:09,280
both you and anika kind of agreed and

00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:13,440
expanded on each other's points

00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:17,520
manuel please please go ahead

00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:21,119
this all the the talking about

00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:22,079
congress is is amazing here in mexico we

00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:24,240
are working

00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:27,839
to create new new companies a little

00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:30,559
companies of technologies and innovation

00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:33,839
projects of innovation with technologies

00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:37,200
uh focus it with philosophy open source

00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:39,920
right now we have maybe a 15

00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,839
15 new companies a little companies

00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,079
created by the students

00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:45,119
which works at the open source lab

00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,559
community

00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:51,040
and right now is a

00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:52,240
selling or getting getting paid and

00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,680
getting paid

00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:58,720
for the your your knowledge uh

00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,280
the mindset the the the the basic

00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,480
mindset

00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:04,160
is to change the way to see the projects

00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:07,680
with open source projects

00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:11,040
because we are we like uh

00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:12,160
open source uh technology users are

00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:16,160
developments

00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,880
developers uh we don't we we can see the

00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,680
projects

00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,599
like a products we must to see the

00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:25,680
projects like a services

00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:29,520
and we must we must to to get him

00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:32,799
to making boys to get money from

00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:34,640
our knowledge i think the the open

00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:36,960
source is a very good opportunity to

00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:39,760
create a new new business model

00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,280
to work to create a new companies a new

00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:44,640
economic model to

00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:48,079
to estrange the actual

00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:49,280
model economic model around the the

00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:51,599
companies

00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,400
specialized in technologies so it's a

00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:55,440
very

00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,400
is it's very important to take the young

00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,920
stalins

00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:03,440
and to take to the

00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:06,480
new new companies and to get

00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,880
all the talent uh to create new model

00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,240
new

00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,559
business model around open source

00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:13,599
technologies so this i i

00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:16,640
totally agree with with hong k and we

00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:19,280
we march we must to

00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,079
approach to the young talent to get the

00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,599
content the

00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:26,240
the truth to create our own companies

00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:28,799
i think is the the main the main way

00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:31,680
here at zacatecas here in mexico we have

00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:32,079
all the support from government but the

00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,240
with

00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:35,680
we don't we don't

00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:38,960
[Music]

00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:42,079
we don't have thinking only is the

00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:45,680
only way to to support or to

00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:47,280
finance or project we must to to try to

00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:50,319
create a new new way

00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:54,160
to strengthen this kind of models and

00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:56,000
the new new economic model new model of

00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,280
business with the open source is a very

00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,839
good opportunity for

00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,839
for for everyone thank you

00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:06,960
thank you so much would you like to take

00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,960
it from

00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,760
i here the things that i would say uh it

00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:18,640
will be a little bit repetitive because

00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:20,640
i went too fast on my first

00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:22,960
iteration and i think i already said

00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:25,280
this but i would

00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:27,760
completely agree with everything that

00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:31,040
manuel had said and also with

00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:34,079
um i really don't know how to

00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:36,960
pronounce your name i'm truly sorry

00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:38,720
and manuel i actually want to ask if we

00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,119
could try to like

00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:42,160
get a few people on mexico not just

00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:45,040
gnome

00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:47,200
and then try to do what i said go to

00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:49,119
some university and do a course for the

00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,799
teachers for the professors and for the

00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:53,440
students i would

00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:54,720
gladly spend a few thousand books and

00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,920
fly to there

00:57:54,720 --> 00:58:01,520
and ask for my bosses to give me a

00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,520
vacation just so i could do that

00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:07,440
thomas so my name is hong folk and it's

00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,680

it has a chinese origin it means as a

00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,400

well before we segment over to the

01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,960
questions and our shared notes because i

01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:42,319
think those

01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:44,720
uh are very much worth asking

01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:47,200
because we we do have about 10 minutes

01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:49,599
remaining regina would you like

01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:51,200
to add any additional comments to our

01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:54,319
question being

01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:55,440
where are there opportunities for all of

01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:57,359
us to collaborate

01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:00,160
and increase users and revenue for linux

01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:10,480
apps keeping in mind we do only have

01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:15,040
about 10 minutes

01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:18,240
okay that's okay thank you

01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:19,359
yeah i do have one application that is

01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:22,240
trying currently

01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:22,839
to join a broader community name is

01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:26,160
wired

01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:26,799
panda this application was started by a

01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,280
professor

01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:30,319
doing his master's on university in

01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:32,079
brazil

01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:34,400
the problem is that the application is

01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:36,000
actually awesome and he does not know

01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,040
what to do with the awesomeness that the

01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,799
application is

01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:44,799
so i'm gonna try to write here the

01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:44,799
try to remember the name of the website

01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:51,599
and i am just pasting this here on the

01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:54,160
chat it is wiredpanda.org

01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:55,920
we are looking for people right now for

01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:58,559
universities to adopt

01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,480
the software and make it grow because

01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:03,520
this is an awesome software to

01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:07,680
teach about you know

01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:11,200
wires and logic circuits

01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:16,160
and we are trying to create a little bit

01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:19,359
of network around this application

01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:21,359
fantastic okay let's

01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:23,839
let's go to our questions from our

01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:23,839
audience

01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:27,520
first question is what do you think what

01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:31,119
do the panel think

01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:34,559
about creating or joining a

01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:37,440
is lug log i'm sorry don't know how i'm

01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:39,599
supposed to pronounce this one

01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,280
i guess is it the link of yourself group

01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:43,920
or on online

01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:46,240
i'm assuming yes linux users group and

01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:48,000
thank you for whoever just typed it in

01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:50,240
so i think the first thing would be to

01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,680
do not use appreciation because people

01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:53,280
from different region might not

01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:55,280
understand what we

01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,880
mean so i think that we should always

01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,799
spell out

01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,200
the word this is the first thing we

01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:01,200
should do

01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,880
and uh to answer that should i just go

01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:06,720
ahead um

01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:08,079
yeah okay so what do you think about

01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:10,319
creating what's running so

01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:12,799
uh i would be i will highly recommended

01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:14,640
it so uh a few years back whenever i

01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:15,440
travel to a new city the first thing i

01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:18,480
would look is

01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:21,599
look for the linux user room in the uh

01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:24,000
in i remember one time i traveled to um

01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,760
johannesburg in in south africa so i

01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,799
contacted someone in the linux user

01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:29,440
group

01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:31,039
and i met him and later on he came to

01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,559
the frost asia somewhere in singapore

01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:34,400
and we have the connection there

01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:36,559
and if you reach out to people and say

01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,839
that you come from similar background

01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:40,720
they always welcome you

01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:42,640
and when i first learned about um on

01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:44,079
open source it also come from the linux

01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:47,119
user group in my university

01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:50,079
where people helped me to install ubuntu

01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:51,200
for the first time in my machine

01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:54,640
unfortunately

01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:59,839
it was very popular a few years back

01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:59,839
and it's coming from here so um

01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:05,200
it's not for me i'm in a very quiet room

01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:07,920
a few years back right linux

01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:08,559
you saw ripper very popular but but not

01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,039
so much

01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:12,720
uh recently because there's so many new

01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:14,720
technologies so people really use a

01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:16,799
group around a certain technology

01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,559
and not so big about linux user look in

01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:21,039
general anymore but more on the

01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:24,400
distribution level for instance you see

01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:26,319
uh ubuntu um user group also like very

01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,160
popular everywhere so it's more

01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:30,240
it's not like before in the beginning i

01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:32,319
i remember like 15

01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,920
12 15 years ago it's always about the

01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:35,119
first thing the first contact would be

01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:38,400
the linear user group

01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:40,480
in a different city but now that

01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,520
generation they're getting older so and

01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:44,559
they're not so

01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:47,440
engaged in air and also um like

01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:48,480
um how to say active anymore but younger

01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:51,440
communication

01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:52,319
who form around specific uh technology

01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:54,240
specific

01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:55,520
linear distribution has become more

01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:57,359
popular

01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:59,119
and i also want to mention here i see in

01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:02,400
the core is

01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:04,559
which is a very um active so he also one

01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:07,680
of the core members of the ubuntu

01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:09,119
user group in south korea i'm very glad

01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,160
that i see him here you know that south

01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:11,920
korea is the

01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:13,680
uh the city normally we don't know so

01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:16,559
much about what's going on there

01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:18,720
but they're very active in in many way

01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:20,640
and uh to answer this question yes think

01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,599
about uh joining i don't know if it's

01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:24,000
now still the

01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:25,280
uh the trend to create a new user linux

01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,039
user group anymore

01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:28,960
but there's so many other if you are

01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:30,799
interested in one distribution go

01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:32,799
find the user group for that

01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:34,079
distribution or for certain technology

01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:37,760
and join them

01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:40,559
highly recommend it okay yeah

01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,599
so i think that's the first question

01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:44,000
yeah

01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:46,240
uh just opening it up does anyone else

01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,400
want to add

01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:49,599
if not having to move on to the next

01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:52,640
question we have

01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:54,960
a couple more second question

01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:56,319
says what do you think about using

01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:59,359
languages other than

01:05:56,319 --> 01:06:02,839
english in fast communities

01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:04,160
for user support development and other

01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:07,280
purposes

01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:09,760
this uh asker says

01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:12,000
i have encouraged this but ironically

01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:19,839
got pushed back from people's

01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:19,839
whose native language is not english

01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:26,480
um i would like to answer that question

01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:28,160
but we started in india and kerala has

01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,839
their own state language which is which

01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:31,440
is malayalam

01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:33,839
so of course people do understand

01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:35,839
english over there but it was not easy

01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:37,599
so what we have done is that we have all

01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:39,200
the documents in english

01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:41,359
and we have asked the local translator

01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,799
to translate translated

01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:44,720
similarly we are going to do the same

01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:47,200
thing for china as well we are going to

01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:50,240
ask the local people to accurately

01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:51,760
translate that for us in china so you

01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:53,119
have as i said before that you have to

01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:55,359
speak the language

01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:56,240
that's the only solution because you

01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:58,880
just have to

01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:00,799
spread the awareness about linux you

01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:02,079
don't have to

01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:04,480
force them to actually understand

01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:04,480
english

01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:14,240
thank you nika would anyone else like to

01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:18,000
to add anything to anika's statement

01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:22,480
and again she was mentioning how

01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:25,680
we have to adapt to the local language

01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:29,119
so yeah brazil has a

01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:30,960
really low entry on english

01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:32,400
most of brazilians they don't understand

01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:35,520
english even when they

01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:37,039
are taught english the english is really

01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:40,160
basic

01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:42,720
one thing that i'm doing on the

01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:44,240
kd brazil community we are translating

01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:47,440
everything

01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:51,039
we are doing everything in portuguese

01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:54,079
and i am also in contact with the

01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:54,960
um future english teachers that are open

01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:57,119
source users

01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:59,280
and they are doing free lessons for a

01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:02,079
few of the members

01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:03,119
and we are fixing or improving software

01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:05,599
for them

01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:06,559
as a reward or something so we are

01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:10,000
trying to

01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:11,920
help each other out making uh

01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,920
one of those silly hollywood movies

01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:15,599
where one people helps another and then

01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:18,080
other helps another and then other help

01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:18,080
some other

01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:24,000
well thank you i'll keep myself brief

01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,920
there's a bunch of noise outside my

01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,759
window so i apologize

01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:31,359
would anyone else like to add maybe

01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:31,359
regina would you like to add anything

01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:41,600
you are needing to rejoin the audio

01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:49,839
yeah so while waiting for regina i can

01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,239
also

01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:54,080
mention that in the first asia community

01:08:52,239 --> 01:08:56,799
uh we organized several

01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:59,120
technical meetings in in hindi as we

01:08:56,799 --> 01:09:01,520
have a lot of contributors in

01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:03,120
in india when they work together i can

01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:06,080
see that they organize their

01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:07,199
their tech stand up and their regular

01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:09,520
technical alignment

01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:10,480
in in their local language so i think it

01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:13,440
is

01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:14,319
also we encourage people to speak in

01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:16,560
their own language that

01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:18,400
definitely applause make people knew far

01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:20,159
more comfortable

01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:21,679
and one time one thing that i also

01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:24,880
learned from from you

01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:28,080
youngbin i'm the um organizer from the

01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:30,960
wooden group in in south korea he also

01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:32,319
recommended us several times that

01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,480
instead of speaking

01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:36,239
to each other on the video call maybe

01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:38,400
it's easier for people

01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:39,279
to type so even though it lasts an

01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:42,719
episode

01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:44,080
to type into sleek but some developers

01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:46,640
more comfortable with

01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:49,199
using writing writing english rather

01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:53,120
than speaking it also

01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:56,560
yeah absolutely makes sense

01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:58,400
do you want to let us know how

01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:59,600
english language is affected in african

01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:02,000
communities

01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:04,239
what are your thoughts on using

01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,719
languages other than english

01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:08,480
for user support development and other

01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:11,760
purposes

01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:15,440
uh can you hear me now excellent

01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:17,679
uh oh sorry i had issues with networks i

01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:21,199
was going back and forth

01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:23,360
okay uh i i think that it's a very good

01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:25,199
um this is my opinion now i think that

01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:28,880
is a very good um

01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:30,880
thing to have other languages

01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,640
translation basically in open source

01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:35,360
project excites me a lot

01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:37,040
basically if you have um translation of

01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:39,760
projects in different languages um

01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:42,560
basically not not african

01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:43,600
but in other types of um languages and i

01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,600
think it helps

01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,800
to bring in onboard new contributors

01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:49,360
into open source projects

01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,920
um but in africa it's something that i

01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,000
uh

01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,679
i would love to see uh that we have

01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,120
different languages in africa um the

01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:56,480
gnome project has been translated in

01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,760
different languages in africa something

01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:00,159
i would love to see

01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:01,440
but yeah again it's uh like i started

01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:03,199
earlier when i was speaking

01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:04,960
one of the one of the things is

01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:05,840
basically road maps while these things

01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,239
have been done

01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:09,440
prior to now which basically at the

01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:11,920
moment

01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:13,520
it's not so clear as to how translations

01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:16,640
of open source projects

01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:17,679
um are being done i would i would love

01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:20,239
to see

01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:21,600
uh basically do a little bit of more

01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:22,480
research on other open source projects

01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:25,360
and see how they've

01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:26,000
done well with translations and it would

01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,920
be you know

01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,520
very nice to invite that in the

01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:31,040
grammatical community in basically

01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,719
the ground project as all since we

01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:35,520
basically are working

01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:36,320
to see that um there's more visibility

01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,080
for the

01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:41,840
gloom project so yeah i think it's a

01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:41,840
very good initiative

01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:48,159
great thank you we are

01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,920
nearly out of time i would love to at

01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:53,120
least get the next question

01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:54,719
out in the world for everyone uh it is

01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:56,960
how is the open source

01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:59,280
software trying to call out for

01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:59,760
companies so they are more attracted to

01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:03,040
use

01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:05,360
non-proprietary software also how is

01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:06,080
open source handling the demands that

01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:08,800
most

01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:11,120
of the proprietary software can handle

01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,560
many times we want to use open source

01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:15,280
software but they just

01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:17,360
can't keep up with the features of

01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:18,239
proprietary software therefore companies

01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:23,679
will pay

01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:25,600
for the proprietary software instead

01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:27,600
why the companies are not also paying

01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:28,400
for the open source software to develop

01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:30,719
themselves

01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:32,480
i mean if the only problem is money they

01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:37,840
can hire developers

01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:37,840
to do the job and improve

01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:44,000
yeah yes

01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:45,440
the answer is we cannot complete we just

01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,800
don't have enough money we are not

01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:49,360
google we are not

01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,000
microsoft how can we invest further into

01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,920
uh like

01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,679
all open source uh software but it

01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:55,840
doesn't mean that we don't have a way to

01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:56,719
succeed so earlier we mentioned about

01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:59,199
offer

01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:01,120
um support for open source uh a rare

01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:03,440
open source software as a

01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:04,480
as a service to offer to companies so a

01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:06,880
lot of companies

01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:08,719
do not make a decision on um using an

01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:12,159
open source because they hesitate of

01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:15,440
the support um uh system do they get

01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:17,360
support to get a meditation service from

01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:19,199
open source application and another

01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:21,040
thing how we can encourage i think here

01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:23,040
in europe and it will be soon

01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:25,920
uh happening everywhere around the world

01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:28,719
like the legislation the government

01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:30,719
thanks to uh to embrace open source so

01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:33,920
if we have something coming from the

01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:36,960
uh the government level that encouraged

01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:38,400
um and find more like

01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:40,640
embrace open source more i think

01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:41,760
companies we also started to look into

01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:44,400
open source

01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,280
in europe there are a lot of uh funding

01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:47,040
for um

01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:49,120
for companies who want to develop

01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:50,640
develop or stack open source i'm also

01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,760
part of the open source business

01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:54,239
alliance europe

01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:56,080
so these are a network of open that of

01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:59,360
uh companies that are doing

01:13:56,080 --> 01:14:00,239
um that develop open source application

01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:02,480
or using

01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:04,159
open source i think we need more uh like

01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:06,239
this so company get together

01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:07,760
and if it changed on the government

01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:09,679
level where more

01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,440
adoption of open source being embraced

01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:14,719
every way also change

01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:18,480
the um the ecosystem

01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:21,440
how many software but they can't keep up

01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:22,719
and yeah so i think that what you

01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:25,920
checked

01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:27,360
yeah just one thing increasing on what

01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:29,280
one sells

01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:30,719
those companies that they that do not

01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:33,679
work on open source

01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:34,159
they are also using open source a lot

01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:37,440
like

01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:39,280
really a lot probably their web servers

01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:41,120
are running linux probably their web

01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:42,960
services are running php

01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:44,719
probably there is something on python

01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:46,800
involved their routers

01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:48,400
are running linux their phones are

01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:52,800
running a kernel on

01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:54,880
linux so yes they are using a lot

01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,480
but why they are not spending a little

01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:58,960
bit trying to improve

01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:00,560
free software does not just means that

01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:03,199
you can get it for free but

01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:03,679
people are working on that and people

01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:06,880
need

01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:08,000
to get paid to work on that on their not

01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:11,120
free time

01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:13,760
um i work in a company that

01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:14,560
luckily allows me to do open source for

01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:18,000
a living

01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:19,920
but when i'm not working on open source

01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,920
i'm also working for open source because

01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:23,520
for me it's fun but for a lot of people

01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:26,080
it's not fun

01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:28,560
and they can't stay on the computer on

01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:28,560
the weekends

01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:35,600
yeah so i think it's more like a chicken

01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:37,360
and egg problem so in order to compete

01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,880
with the feature set of the

01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,480
old software we need to have the frame

01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:42,320
that funding before we have the funding

01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:44,560
we need to get somebody to pay for

01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:45,920
for open source application and in order

01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,960
to get somebody to pay for open source

01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,480
applications

01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:50,800
we need to make sure that we offer the

01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:52,000
services we need to pay people so that

01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:55,760
we can offer the services

01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:58,159
around our software to do the business

01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:59,040
yeah but i think with the current

01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:00,960
development and

01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:02,880
of course um we did not have a chance to

01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:06,800
go to another question

01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:10,719
when we discussed about how the pandemic

01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:12,480
influence the false ecosystem i think

01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:14,960
of course it's not good the pandemic but

01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:17,199
it also opened up a lot of opportunities

01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:18,080
where people see how important it is to

01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:21,040
be

01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:21,760
transparent um to be collaborated to be

01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:24,400
open

01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:25,360
to develop better solution altogether so

01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,719
i think this is

01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:29,120
the right time and you see also the

01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:32,400
opportunity for us we see a lot of

01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:34,960
open source um application in health

01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:36,000
like being developed during the pandemic

01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:38,400
and they are more

01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,280
in different uh in different industry

01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:42,080
yeah

01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:43,360
and i have a high hope and also very

01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:46,840
positive for the future

01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:48,960
of a false ecosystem even though it is

01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:53,040
challenging

01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:54,480
thank you okay well our next talk begins

01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:57,520
in 10 minutes

01:16:54,480 --> 01:17:00,080
there is only one more question left

01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:00,960
if if you all are happy to to give it a

01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:05,199
quick answer

01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:10,320
and happy to give us the time for it

01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:12,960
um so i'll take silence yes

01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:13,760
uh the final question from our audience

01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:16,679
is

01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:18,880
what success story can you share on a

01:17:16,679 --> 01:17:20,960
self-sustaining project

01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:23,920
that you have been involved with or

01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,920
influenced

01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:33,600
i see the link being put into the notes

01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:37,679
um well with would you like to or hong

01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:40,239
tomaz regina i think both gnome and kd

01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:41,920
are a really good example of a

01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:46,640
self-sustainable source

01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:50,320
i mean genomics use it on really huge

01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:53,840
um linux installs from the red hots that

01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:56,080
it's a really expensive linux

01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:59,040
red hat is more expensive than windows

01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:01,440
server and let's use it there

01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:02,480
so just to show that free software does

01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:05,600
not mean that it's

01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:08,760
graphics and

01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:12,159
kd is up and running since

01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:14,239
96 97 i mean it's

01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:15,679
more than 25 years there is a lot of

01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:19,679
people that are working

01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:22,960
today on kd that could have been a kd

01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:25,280
son if kde was a person and this is

01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:27,600
self-sustainable

01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:29,600
they are i think just should picture

01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:32,719
fail now even if they are

01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:35,920
not uh like a

01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:37,840
company that deals with currency

01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:40,000
they don't actually need currency to

01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:43,280
keep up but they do need a little

01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:45,760
bit of currency just to make people

01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:48,239
together once or twice a year

01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:51,600
because it's much better to work with

01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:51,600
your colleagues by your side

01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:59,520
um

01:18:55,600 --> 01:19:01,600
okay okay and so i also put in the two

01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:04,400
projects that i directly um

01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:06,159
involved uh it's under the first asia

01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:08,560
community so the first project is a

01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:10,719
hardware project the pocket science lab

01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:12,080
so it's been developed for about four

01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:14,000
years now and being

01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:15,440
a success so we have different way to

01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,719
disassemble the two projects so the

01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:19,440
pocket sign lab

01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:19,840
will sustain uh this project uh drew

01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:22,320
like

01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:23,520
a different source of funding we work

01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:26,560
together with the eu

01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:29,520
on the horizon 2020 and

01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:30,960
and we also get funding from uh from

01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:33,040
different programs where they

01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:34,840
where they have to grow the open source

01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:38,719
uh hardware um

01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:41,280
uh ecosystem and uh we also offer

01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:43,280
um like um the product so the board that

01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:44,320
we make we sell on different channels so

01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:47,600
distribution

01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:48,560
in china in um in the u.s and europe

01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:51,840
everywhere so

01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:53,920
selling the device in so a way to to get

01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:55,679
an income to pay for the development so

01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:57,199
this is the first project

01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:59,360
the second project is an event

01:19:57,199 --> 01:20:00,080
management system eventually this is

01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,920
also

01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:03,440
tightly open source and the model how we

01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:07,120
can sustain this um

01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:09,120
event yeah is to uh similar to uh due to

01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:10,800
event price or another commercial

01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:13,120
service so people pay

01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:14,719
um for open source community if you

01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:16,560
don't sell a ticket you you don't pay

01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:19,440
but if you want some kind of

01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:20,080
like commercial um sales and tickets so

01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:22,239
we just

01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:23,600
own commission like for a small

01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:26,000
commission when you

01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,360
earn income and i think this is also uh

01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,239
um

01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:30,880
like often seen model for for for many

01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:33,280
software

01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:34,320
yeah so so you pay when you also get an

01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:36,960
income for your

01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:38,000
event these are the two um projects and

01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,960
two different

01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:44,080
funding models that um i've been

01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,080
directly involved with

01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:49,360
let me let me just um add to that um

01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:51,199
basically i i think just to um

01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:53,280
expand on the gnome foundation project

01:20:51,199 --> 01:20:54,719
basically um

01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:56,719
looking at the group foundation project

01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:59,840
when it started um um

01:20:56,719 --> 01:21:01,840
apart from it being um self form

01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:03,520
you know funding that we get basically

01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:05,040
you would see that the gnome foundation

01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:07,760
also have

01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:09,840
a way of creating them legacy programs

01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:12,400
basically that allows it to

01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:13,040
continue to um sustain itself for

01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:15,840
example

01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:17,600
um projects like um the altitude that

01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,000
came out from ground and basically and

01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:20,000
now

01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,840
we are running the educational challenge

01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,920
as well and glen foundation

01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:25,600
is basically still you know with looking

01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:28,239
at other ways to

01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:30,080
skill as well to you know to bring up

01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:33,520
sustainable projects so i think

01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:35,440
sustainability um um um if we look at it

01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:39,199
in a more um

01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:41,760
diverse way it's um the project is not

01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:43,760
relying basically on what it has been

01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:45,920
fed with for over 20 years

01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:48,000
the project is expanding itself to other

01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:50,239
not other um aspects of

01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,679
um the world globally and you know and i

01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:53,520
think that's uh

01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:57,840
one of the exciting thing about um the

01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:57,840
ground foundation project basically

01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:05,840
would you like to add anything yeah

01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:09,920
thank you alison

01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:10,960
i think i think the very important

01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:14,400
project

01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:17,520
i i am user i am just i am using

01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:20,000
linux from 19 1996

01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:21,840
with the first edition the first version

01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:25,280
of mandrake

01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:28,800
so ah i think uh

01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:32,159
absolutely i agree with thomas and katie

01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:36,000
was the first the first ui in india

01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:39,920
a graphical interface for the linux

01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:43,120
but i i i want to share

01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:46,239
i think uh in here in zacatecas

01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:49,280
around the open source lab we are

01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:51,120
we are getting the the

01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:53,120
trust from the government and right now

01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,920
at government of the state of zacatecas

01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:58,400
we

01:22:53,920 --> 01:23:01,199
we have maybe 10 10 biggest projects

01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:03,280
10 more important places for government

01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:03,920
which are developed and developed with

01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:06,719
the

01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:07,199
technology of open source technologies

01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:10,080
so

01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:12,080
i think it's a very proud for us because

01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:15,440
our projects

01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:16,560
which don't have the government don't

01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:20,639
have to

01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:24,320
to pay expensive expensive money

01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:25,280
because uh we are we are working from

01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:28,400
open source

01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:29,360
but the more important is our guys or

01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:32,719
students

01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:33,679
which develop this project is working

01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:37,600
for government

01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:39,840
like support like a background technical

01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:41,920
background to this kind of project so

01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,280
it's very important because they go to

01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:45,679
the government

01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:46,639
and working for this specifically for

01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:50,480
this project

01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:53,360
uh together with this project

01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:54,639
are developed they are they are working

01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:57,600
to develop

01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:58,560
maybe five or six another projects for

01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:01,440
this this

01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:02,320
this instance from government so i think

01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:05,679
the the

01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:09,199
model open source lab may make

01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:12,880
may get the impact to the government

01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:16,080
uh right now we we was starting

01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:19,040
to try to adopt and to migrate

01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:19,679
to use open source at government but

01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:22,639
it's uh

01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:23,520
it's uh youtube because it's very

01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:27,600
complex the

01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:30,639
the the market around it open source

01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:33,440
around in technologies

01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:34,480
so but we are right now we have a

01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:38,480
government

01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:39,199
maybe 95 of the of our infrastructure of

01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:41,440
government

01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:42,239
are working with open source

01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:45,840
technologies

01:24:42,239 --> 01:24:48,080
and they i i am sure it's a very

01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:49,280
very good it's a very good impact it's a

01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:51,440
very good benefit

01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:52,560
for the government is very important for

01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:55,840
us so

01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:57,199
we are working with works to to make

01:24:55,840 --> 01:25:00,639
more projects

01:24:57,199 --> 01:25:03,360
but in the same way we most

01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:04,480
works to create new companies with open

01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:07,760
source technologies

01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:12,159
with new italian italian talent with

01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:15,360
new uh entrepreneurs creating or

01:25:12,159 --> 01:25:18,480
these own companies i i think is is that

01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:18,480
