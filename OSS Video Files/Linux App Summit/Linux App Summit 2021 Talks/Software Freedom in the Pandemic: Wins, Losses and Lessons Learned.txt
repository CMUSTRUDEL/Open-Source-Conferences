Publication date: 2021-05-30
Playlist: Linux App Summit 2021 Talks
Description: 
	We're over a year into the pandemic and starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel. During this tumultuous time, we've seen massive societal changes and struggled as a movement to rise to the challenges presented to us. While there have been quite a few successes as we've held remote conferences, cheered while others learned to work remotely, continued our collaborative communities and supported each other, there are many things that we wish were better. Karen will talk about our biggest triumphs, our lost opportunities and explore how we can learn from all of this to come together to push the software freedom movement forward beyond a return to "normal times" and into the future.

Q&A


1. How/why do you think we failed in the adoption of these different free and open tools? 
2. Do you think adoption of remote tools will stay for future FOSS events after the pandemic ends? Considering from a PoV where it helps spread out the word for people who are unable to travel.
