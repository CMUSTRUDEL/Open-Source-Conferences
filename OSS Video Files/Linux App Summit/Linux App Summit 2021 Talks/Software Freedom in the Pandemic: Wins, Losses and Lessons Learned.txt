Title: Software Freedom in the Pandemic: Wins, Losses and Lessons Learned
Publication date: 2021-05-30
Playlist: Linux App Summit 2021 Talks
Description: 
	We're over a year into the pandemic and starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel. During this tumultuous time, we've seen massive societal changes and struggled as a movement to rise to the challenges presented to us. While there have been quite a few successes as we've held remote conferences, cheered while others learned to work remotely, continued our collaborative communities and supported each other, there are many things that we wish were better. Karen will talk about our biggest triumphs, our lost opportunities and explore how we can learn from all of this to come together to push the software freedom movement forward beyond a return to "normal times" and into the future.

Q&A


1. How/why do you think we failed in the adoption of these different free and open tools? 
2. Do you think adoption of remote tools will stay for future FOSS events after the pandemic ends? Considering from a PoV where it helps spread out the word for people who are unable to travel.

um so i i'm gonna tell you just a tiny

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,199
bit about myself

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,799
many of you already know me my name is

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:08,000
karen sandler and

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,760
i am really interested in software

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,560
freedom for a variety of issues but one

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,119
of those things

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,799
and i was talking about this in the uh

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,080
the chat just a moment ago

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:21,600
is that i have a big heart

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,720
i have um oh okay

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,080
so oh trying to turn down b suggests

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,920
turning down my uh

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,920
my gain a little bit so i will do that

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,759
how's that is that a little bit better

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,520
i'll just keep continuing and we can

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,720
adjust as we go um

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,159
so uh so i have a

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,960
i have a big heart i have a heart

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,280
condition it's called hypertrophic

00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,640
cardiomyopathy

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,479
um and that means that my heart is

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,200
literally thicker than a normal person's

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,240
heart and i have

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,880
it means that when it uh when it

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,920
it beats it sort of beats a little bit

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,520
less efficiently

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,640
and this is generally not a problem but

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,520
i have a very high risk of suddenly

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,319
dying

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,680
um and uh that's the medical term that

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,239
they use is called sudden death

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,080
and um so i have a pacemaker

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,200
defibrillator implanted

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,840
um right uh in my chest and it

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,800
uh it's it's screwed into my heart with

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,360
a wire and

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,319
it monitors my heart and if i get into a

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,959
dangerous rhythm

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,400
then it um it shocks me and this is

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,040
actually a picture of

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,560
my old defibrillator that used to be in

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,519
my body and you can see that there's

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,440
like a little

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,040
uh like dents and scratches which i

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,040
think is when they pried it out

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,120
um i think it's really cool to to be

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,599
able to see the stuff that uh that was

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,519
once a part of me and so uh you know

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,080
getting this defibrillator cause i've

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,440
given

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,120
talks about this before and i won't talk

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,120
about it for too long here but it caused

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,280
me to reevaluate the technology that we

00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,319
rely on and my own technology

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,959
um and and instead of uh of

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,640
feeling um you know a little bit

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,920
helpless from the whole procedure i feel

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,760
like is a very

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,080
empowering thing and so i think like to

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,440
think of myself as a as a cyborg

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,280
and um and i'm a a lawyer as well

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,120
um and uh and so i like to think of

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,879
myself as a cyborg lawyer which is in a

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,239
way quite terrifying

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,080
and and i basically um

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,080
through that whole experience i became

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,599
very passionate about software freedom

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:33,120
um i once upon a time was lawyer to

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,560
lots and lots of free and open source

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,879
software projects

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,920
and that included both gnome and kde

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,480
so so that was pretty cool there's a

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,519
question

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,519
of why does it have two serial codes

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,920
and it's that one is the model number

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,799
and one is the serial code

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,319
so yeah so we were putting questions in

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,400
the

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,720
public chat now that i'll respond to and

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,400
we can go to the shared notes later

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,760
and after after the talk is over um

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,080
so uh so all of this um

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,840
caused me to believe that software

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,560
transparency was really important and we

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,280
needed to

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,120
be able to audit our code when when i

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,359
have an engineering background and

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,639
um and then became a lawyer and um and

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,959
not being able to see the source code of

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,560
my own body was quite

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,199
upsetting and so um uh

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,040
that caused me to be a real uh real

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,720
advocate for software freedom and

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,160
gave me the opportunity to advocate for

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,280
gnome and other free and open source

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,440
software projects

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,000
um in that way and i thought that it was

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,280
all about transparency and then when i

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,520
um i was pregnant i got shocked

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,280
unnecessarily by my defibrillator

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,720
um because my heart was palpitating

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,600
which is super normal for

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,960
um for pregnant women um it's about a

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,520
quarter to a third of all women they

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,840
think have

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,880
uh they estimate have palpitations and

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,199
so um

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,040
and so because my heart was palpitating

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,720
but i had a defibrillator it thought

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,280
that my heart was in a dangerous rhythm

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,680
and it

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,720
it shocked me um even though i didn't

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,240
need to be shocked

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,759
and the only way for me to stop

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,840
my defibrillator from giving me

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,160
unnecessary treatment was to take

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,680
drugs that slowed my heart rate down so

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,800
much so that i had a hard time walking

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,880
up a flight of stairs

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,479
and it was like really hard to um

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,400
to get my head around when this happened

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,880
and you know it was a little bit

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,240
upsetting but but ultimately it worked

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,960
out okay because

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,600
the drugs were fine i managed to you

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,919
know i

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,880
i had the baby and everything was fine

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,000
and um but i

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,560
i it really was very um

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,120
a very interesting experience because

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,160
what

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,280
i learned from it is that even though

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,600
um everybody involved in the process

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,440
had the best of intentions right even

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,600
though everybody who worked at the

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,639
medical device manufacturer

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,880
and um and

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,080
uh and all of the medical technicians

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,639
and the doctors

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,720
all wanted to help me and provide me

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,880
with life-saving technology

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,840
my use case was not a use case that was

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,120
anticipated

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,639
by the manufacturers because a very

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,400
small number of people at any given time

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,639
are pregnant and have defibrillators

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,720
only 15 percent of defibrillators go to

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,680
people under the age of 65.

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,800
so uh when i raised this to my um to

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,600
like the head of

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,360
high-risk uh obstetrics where i at my

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,800
hospital where i gave birth

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:36,319
um uh she said i've never i've never

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,759
and you know i've i've only uh once had

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,440
a patient with a

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,120
defibrillator i've had pacemaker to

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,240
favor pacemaker patients but not

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,280
defibrillator patients

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,880
anyway so um so it really stood for this

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,000
proposition of like well there are going

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,000
to be lots of use cases

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,360
that the manufacturers don't anticipate

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,319
even if everyone has the best of

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,560
intentions and

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,440
the only way that we will be able to

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,000
have

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,440
technology that we rely on over time is

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,120
by making sure that it's free and open

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,080
and that we have control over it as a as

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,800
a society

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,840
and have the ability to have collective

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,280
action

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:12,720
so um that's um

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:15,840
that's a uh you know it was a really

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,919
defining moment for me and it really

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,759
changed the the lens for me of how i

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,160
view software freedom and so

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,479
um i think of software freedom as a

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,160
deeply personal issue

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,360
and even though we rely often on

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,160
collective action

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,520
in order to make sure that like to take

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,919
advantage of

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,680
software freedom um especially for folks

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,360
that are not developers

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,840
um the the ideas behind software freedom

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,599
and

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,160
making sure that our technology is safe

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,280
for us to rely on our deeply intertwined

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,120
and so that's sort of i wanted to just

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,560
give you the introduction so you can

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,120
understand

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,000
where i'm coming from and how i see the

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,280
whole

00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,800
software freedom movement

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,759
so um and incidentally that picture was

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,800
taken at a

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,319
aquatic and all this to say so now we're

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,120
this is many years later and

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,680
we are in a pandemic and i miss all of

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,680
you

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,199
um i just want to start that i was

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,120
looking down this list of names and

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,319
there are so many people who

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,360
i care so deeply about and i miss you

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,160
i i also miss those of you who i don't

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,039
know

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,080
because as someone who is trying to

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,879
advocate

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,160
for a better for better technology for a

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,719
better society

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,760
for um you know for for things to

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,880
improve

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,080
i i i can't do that alone i'm only i'm

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,719
only one advocate

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,120
and so much has happened over the last

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,000
year

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,040
and i look forward to conferences and

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,080
interactions

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,080
to reset to reset myself

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,080
and also to hear what all of you think

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,519
so i can learn and so that we can better

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,200
function as a movement

00:08:53,519 --> 00:09:00,560
and so i i i really can't underscore

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,600
how much i miss seeing all of you

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,240
and talking to you um

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,000
so uh and and and thinking about that

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,399
and thinking about how special

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,920
this conference is and how it comes out

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,279
of you know it's it's such a

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,800
collaborative process

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,920
it made me think of this conference and

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,080
if anybody can post in a public chat

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,000
if they know if they can guess what

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,839
conference this is

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,399
and i'd be curious to see if anyone

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,080
could uh could guess it

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,240
so i'll just leave it for just a second

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,120
longer so that people could figure it

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,839
out and i'm

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,720
curious if anyone's gonna gonna guess it

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,839
okay all right so we're going to move on

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,399
to the next slide

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,680
but i'll keep putting your guesses in

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,720
and i'll let you know

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,760
later on if anyone gets it right

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,800
okay um so

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,120
you know we rely on conferences a lot

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,120
um

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,399
in order to reset our remote communities

00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,200
because we're all working around the

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,399
world

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,519
and and of course we're

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,920
you know no one was better prepared

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,440
for a pandemic in a way than we were in

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,720
terms of the remote nature

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:16,839
of of of avoiding other people in person

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:20,399
like we were very well situated to

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,000
um uh uh we were very well situated to

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,160
deal with uh with working from home

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,760
almost all of us that i i and again

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,959
looking at the list of names on the side

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,760
those of you who i know

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,440
almost all of you were uh or a very high

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,640
percentage of you were already working

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,880
from uh from home before the

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,640
the pandemic already happened and

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,920
conservancy which is the organization

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,880
that i work for the software freedom

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,600
conservancy

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,200
um we're a charitable nonprofit that

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,000
that is a fiscal sponsor and so we've

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,399
got around 50

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,680
member projects and we're also known for

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,320
working on

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,680
um defending the gpl and enforcing

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,040
copyleft and

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,800
also for our um our project

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,399
member project outreachy which i will

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,839
talk about in a little bit too

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,279
um so so we at conservancy were already

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,920
a remote organization

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,320
but um but not going to conferences was

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,959
uh

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,600
was really a a change and not being able

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,040
to

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,920
uh to see people um

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,519
luna mentions that that it is our it is

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,160
always better to see people online than

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,720
not at all

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,079
and i think that is exactly right and

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,800
that is why

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,399
we are we are here today because even

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,880
though we can't be in person

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,040
and it's not the same it's still really

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,800
important for us to get together and

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,120
um and share our ideas um and and sync

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,360
up

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,800
and i i should just i i went forward on

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,360
the slide so i'm gonna have to go back

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,959
again

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,200
but um but this picture is a uh

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,720
it's a a photo i found that's marked in

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,760
public domain where it's a doll

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,760
it looks like the doll is working

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,959
remotely it looks like the doll has a

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,959
keyboard but when you look a little

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,519
closer it's actually a television remote

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,600
which i

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,360
really astounded me when i i noticed

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,399
that um

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,720
so the um

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,480
the upside to this the huge win was that

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,519
we were ready to deal with this kind of

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,519
situation

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,200
we know how to communicate with each

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,880
other from afar we know how to

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,720
communicate

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,120
asynchronously and we know how to

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,560
communicate synchronously

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,079
when you know using various online

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,600
communication tools

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:27,360
and we had a lot of tools

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,360
going into this that we had already

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,639
developed and relied on and worked into

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,120
our communities

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,480
before the pandemic so this is one of

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,600
those situations

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,680
where we are so

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,279
like we we we were we were so ahead of

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,040
the curve both in understanding what it

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,839
means to work remotely

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,240
and um and how to gather people together

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,480
to

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,279
discuss important issues remotely but

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,680
also

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:57,040
we were ready with the tools that

00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:00,480
that would help us to

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:03,839
to do that with software freedom but

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,360
unfortunately that the fact that we had

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,240
these tools and that they were really

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,360
good

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,120
did not help us to spread the use of

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,360
those tools generally

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:19,680
the um i think

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:22,399
i can do a poll can i do a pull

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,399
yes i can

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,160
i'm going to set up a really super quick

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,160
poll

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:38,800
no i think i i set up an accidental

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,519
instead of an actual accidental yes or

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,440
no poll

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:46,160
i think which uh failed anyway

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,240
i i guess just uh i was just looking for

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,600
a yes or no for people who

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,760
um people who knew

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,120
who have friends and relatives who

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,519
started using

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,399
teleconferencing or other remote tools

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,000
that had not

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,959
used it before i would guess it's

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,279
actually uh oh i did a yes no yeah okay

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,000
yes

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,120
yes i was wondering if uh oh yeah okay

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,839
so people are saying yes they didn't

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,000
know

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,920
probably almost everybody here has

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,600
someone or many people

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,360
who had never purchased any of these

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,399
remote tools and

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,680
and started using them and i was so you

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,800
know we were all

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,079
in a we were all in a negative emotional

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,480
state when the pandemic

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,920
started of course um there were very

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,279
serious issues and there have been very

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,480
serious issues both

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,040
uh both related directly to um to cover

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,279
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,120
but also to a lot of political

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,760
situations throughout the world during

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,279
this time

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,800
and so it's been an extremely stressful

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,320
time in a variety of ways but at the

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,279
beginning of the pandemic part of me was

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,560
thinking

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,160
well at least this is a great

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,120
opportunity for us to be able to get

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,120
people to use

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,800
the tools that we have started to work

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,680
on and it was

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,480
it was in a way exciting but at the same

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,959
time

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,720
they what what really happened is that

00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,920
people jumped on the proprietary tools

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,480
that were already there

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,440
um many people who had never heard of

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,680
zoom before

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,040
started talking about zoom zoom fatigue

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,240
as if they had been using zoom their

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,279
whole lives it was

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,920
uh you know really really fascinating um

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,120
you know a parent group at my kids

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,720
school

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:21,440
they they set up a a a slack

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,760
um you know room and they were

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,760
encouraging people to join and

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:30,160
and even though i suggested we used

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,800
one of the other solutions instead and

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:36,560
set it up and made it available

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,959
i did not somehow do that in a way that

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,399
was

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,160
effective enough that people felt like

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,839
they would adopt it they all used

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,519
these proprietary tools that had been

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,519
standing around and that that

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,120
were also functioning at the same time

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,320
even though many of them

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,600
had a very steep learning curve for the

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,560
proprietary tools

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,199
and um and which would have been similar

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,360
to

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,360
the free and open source software tools

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,079
and so it was

00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:04,160
extremely disappointing because the

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,519
ability to have people come onto you are

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,519
solutions that could have been

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,160
customizable that could have had

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,920
so many more um you know could have had

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,880
follow-on effects for investment in the

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,120
technology

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,120
didn't really materialize and so one of

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,000
the deep disappointments of the pandemic

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,639
is that

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,399
folks began to understand a little bit

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,920
more about our lives the way we

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,600
collaborate and the way we

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,079
conduct our communities all around the

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,240
world but at the same time

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,120
we failed to bring our solutions and we

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,880
failed to i mean

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,360
we did in some ways and i'll get to that

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,600
too so i don't want to be too negative

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,399
but but you know negotiating these power

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,720
dynamics is

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,399
really really hard you know when people

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,360
are under deep stress

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,720
it's very difficult to say well i know

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,199
you want to talk to someone and they

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,560
want to

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,120
you know i know you want to talk to me

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,639
and you want to use zoom but can you use

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,880
will you use jitsi will you use big blue

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,040
button can we can we talk about that

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,320
and what i found was that you have to

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,959
really evaluate

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,680
where what the power dynamic is and

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,160
where you stand on that how can you be

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,160
con

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,679
you know how can you be considerate of

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,400
other people's

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,240
mental state and their needs while also

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,000
being a zealous advocate

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:18,160
being a a really persuasive advocate and

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,760
being appropriately uncompromising and

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,000
this is really really difficult

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,919
um you know an example of what i found

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,959
for example is that like

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:31,200
um here's a good one so my

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:33,679
um my one of my children

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,039
takes violin lessons and um and the

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,039
violin teacher

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,320
suggested a proprietary tool i think it

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,760
was facetime

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:44,240
but because i pay that teacher

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,080
for lessons i was it was very easy for

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,799
me to say okay this is a situation

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,000
i have control over this situation so

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,280
i'm going to

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,320
um i'm going to ask to move it to

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,840
a free solution even though it's a

00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,280
little bit of an inconvenience and i can

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,799
offer to pay for that time

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,720
that if there's any learning time and it

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,120
turns out this you know

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,640
uh i think that one was jitsy jesse is

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,559
so easy you know so easy to use and so

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,880
is big blue button there wasn't any time

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,919
uh for training but the uh the teacher

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,600
appreciated that

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,960
that offer and then it was easy to move

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,799
to that whereas

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:22,080
an institutional decision so i teach a

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,840
class at columbia law school and they

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,200
had made the decision to use zoom

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:30,320
it was uh it was a non-starter to try to

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,200
negotiate a chain a move away from that

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,200
for the whole

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,320
uh for for my class within the law

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,559
school um

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,760
and they have a whole structure for for

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,520
classes but i could move my

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,400
participation off to the extent that i

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,080
could so i

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,840
made a big blue button room and that's

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,160
what we used and so you know

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,440
it's it's it's tricky because it's

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,320
alienating to

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,240
run in and say no no we must use only

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,039
free tools and if you don't you're a bad

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,799
person

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,000
it's not a great way especially to deal

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,440
with people when they're under stress

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,039
it's a great way to make them never want

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,440
to work with you ever again

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,799
but at the same time to use every ounce

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,559
of our power

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,559
in the situation to get people to use

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,840
better tools because by getting people

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,679
to use better tools

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,200
it will it will improve things in the

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,919
long run for everyone

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,039
and so you know i think it's what we've

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,360
learned is that it

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,880
it it's particularly uh it's

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,720
particularly difficult to negotiate

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,600
these power dynamics and i think that

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,000
um in some ways uh we we failed and one

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,360
of those

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
ways was largely in so many conferences

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,440
that were organized for free and open

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,679
source software

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:38,640
we're done um uh we're done

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,440
in um we're done using proprietary

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,840
solutions

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,760
um there was even there were even

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,679
conferences that were built as

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,760
as software freedom as free software

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,320
conferences that were using

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,679
proprietary software and for those

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,360
conferences

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,960
you know i think it's really important

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,640
to meet people where they are

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,080
if people want to use the tools that

00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,600
they are going to use and that means

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,320
that people can hear your message more

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,799
clearly

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,840
then it's worth using them so for

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,840
example

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,360
a conference about ventilators that i

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,280
attended you know

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,799
it it's not you know that's not within

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,320
the software freedom community

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,240
uh but i could bring the ideas of

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,880
software freedom to them that's worth

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,240
engaging with proprietary software for

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,600
to get people to move away from

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,840
proprietary software

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,120
but conferences that are for for

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,720
software freedom

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,080
is it really a software freedom

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,840
conference if it's on proprietary

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,600
software and if all of the attendees

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,320
have to use proprietary software

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,200
and so um you know i really had to

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,080
figure out how to

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,679
handle that and in many situations i

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,520
recorded a talk that

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:43,200
using free software that included um

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,280
an explanation of why the proprietary

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,039
software was bad but i was

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:52,159
disheartened and upset because

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,880
like how how could it seem like

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,400
how could it be that um that we would

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,000
need to rely on these proprietary

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,440
solutions in order to have

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,720
our conferences even amongst ourselves

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:08,240
and so it was really really tough

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,880
um but

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,039
there were some wins in this time and i

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,640
would say that gwadick last year was one

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,280
of the first conferences that i went to

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,039
that was

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,720
a big blue button conference and it went

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,520
remarkably well thanks to the

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,600
sysadmin team and then um and just the

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,640
fact that we're meeting here

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,280
using big blue button is a huge one and

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,000
um and really reflects a ton of work

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,559
from the conference

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,240
organizers so i'm you know really

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,159
grateful for that and we have

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,480
you know about 100 people that are all

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,520
um here listening to this talk right now

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,080
live and i just you know that is

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,280
is it's it's uh it's it's it's a

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,960
difficult task

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,360
task and i'm really grateful for the

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,400
organizers for for doing that

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,559
um and um and and

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,039
uh the mo i think the biggest software

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,120
freedom win and conferences

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,360
over the pandemic so far was fosdem they

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,960
invested an incredible amount of time

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,440
and energy and resources

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,000
in making fosdem online be completely

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,840
free

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,120
and they were wildly successful um

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:15,840
fosdem had i think in total around 40

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,480
000 people participate in it and at one

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,000
time

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,240
peak attendance was 33 000 attendees

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,280
and it was all done using a combination

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,880
of different

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,799
those different tools that i had in the

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,679
previous slide

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,360
they had 25 simultaneously simultaneous

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,600
talks of the same you know like

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,360
going on at any given time um i

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,919
co-organized the legal and policy dev

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,080
room so i just have a screenshot of our

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,960
um of a panel that uh it was the the

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,559
organizers

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:47,440
from uh that dev room at our peak we had

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,000
almost 300 people just in our own dev

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,039
room

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,720
and it all went completely well and so

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,880
the huge win is that we demonstrated

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,080
that it was possible there are a ton

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,919
of uh of of

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,120
conferences that are smaller that said

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,159
that they couldn't they couldn't

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,400
possibly handle

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:07,200
a um using free software to conduct the

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,679
conference

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,039
but i'm so glad that fosdem demonstrated

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,520
that it could be done on such a

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,159
big scale because now we know that it's

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,080
possible

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,000
and if we can invest the resources we

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,480
can do it and it was great there were

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,080
private rooms where organizers were able

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,600
to talk to speakers and get them queued

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,960
up and answer any questions and have

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,520
them ready and then

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,520
there was the ability to invite

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,440
participants at the track into a private

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,280
room to have conversations with speakers

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,360
after their talks so that

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,000
it simulated the hallway track it was

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,600
extremely successful and i think was

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,039
was really exciting and i really have to

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,720
applaud the positive organizers for

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:45,200
doing that because now we know

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,440
that it's just a matter of resources and

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,640
that we can invest them

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,799
and and have a have a free format

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,480
so i think that was a huge win during

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,240
the pandemic for software freedom

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,760
even though um it's been so

00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,840
disappointing over and over again to be

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:03,200
asked to use proprietary software

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,080
um and i i use this this is a slide of a

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,679
tweet

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:09,039
where um where somebody posted a um a

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,919
news of a german town that was running

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:14,400
their own jitsi server

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,559
so that schools and local choir groups

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,159
don't have to rely on skype and zoom

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,000
and there are quite a lot of those small

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,919
stories like that folks that are

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,760
schools that are using big blue button

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,760
um uh

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,760
governments that are local governments

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,240
that were making uh jitsi and big blue

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,000
button

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,960
available to their constituents so that

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,440
they could avoid using um

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,960
free and open source software and so um

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,559
and have some kind of

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,880
local control and i've been doing a

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,919
bunch of local of advocating with local

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,640
politicians

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,320
to explain to them how how things could

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,120
be done differently and how if we have

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,799
our own

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,720
um instances that means that we have a

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,480
lot of control over um over how that

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,679
could be and that there are

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,600
companies that they could hire for

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,960
support and it creates a whole ecosystem

00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,400
and then we could improve the tools

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,559
themselves and not rely

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,520
on big proprietary surveillance

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,559
platforms

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,640
so you know i think that

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,799
i think that it's easy to be negative

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,559
about it because it's disheartening

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,000
to be asked over and over again to use

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,600
proprietary software

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,360
but one of the great things that came

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,880
out is that we have the alternatives and

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,120
we can offer them and we just need to

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,559
stick to our guns but more importantly

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,279
provide the resources

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,679
so that folks don't feel feel like the

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,520
free

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,679
peop folks that you feel like the free

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,200
options are are really viable and that

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,039
they'll be supported when they do that

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,880
and each one of us should engage with

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:42,000
our local politicians to let them know

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:45,679
that this is the case

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,679
try to move forward in the next slide

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,320
but there we go but then i went too of

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,679
course

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,840
um and so um one of the conferences that

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,919
i mentioned was the ventilator

00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,919
conference um

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,640
there was a what's one thing that has

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,080
been really positive about the pandemic

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,919
is that this idea that

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,120
we need to come together as a community

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,640
because there are

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,039
uh our real problems that we as a

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,919
society can can solve together

00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,600
right away when when we we all began to

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,279
understand the nature of the pandemic

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,520
people came together and started

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,679
uh locally every people started making

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,600
masks themselves and distributing them

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,039
um you know i had a neighbor who just

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,640
dropped off masks with

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,080
with any household that wanted them on

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,279
the block um

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,799
people started turning to um how we can

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,600
use 3d printing and

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:37,200
other technology in order to um to help

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,520
everybody else and there was this case

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,840
of a

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,159
hospital in italy that was using 3d

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,880
printed valves

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,520
which which worked out really well there

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,000
was some

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,600
misinformation about the whether there

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,480
were

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,919
threats made by the manufacturer over

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,000
the

00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,960
the patents on those devices but

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,840
ultimately

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,720
the company was very happy for these

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,440
valves to be

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,080
printed locally to save lives and there

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,720
was this

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,880
um this idea of we're in this together

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:15,200
and we can all contribute together

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:18,880
that i think was a win for our society

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,039
during the pandemic and

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,960
there are a ton of open source

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,640
ventilator projects public invention has

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,679
identified over a hundred

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,799
and this is one of the areas where we

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:33,919
have um we have difficulty because we

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,640
have uh we have we have this idea that

00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,000
we're gonna

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,520
uh scratch our itch and i don't need to

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,200
tell a community that comes out of the

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,440
desktop space how tough it is

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,720
when you've got um lots and lots of

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,720
different viable solutions

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,080
solving try you know working on a

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,520
similar problem but not fully

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,960
cooperating together

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:54,320
and this is uh you know much more

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,600
of the case in the um in the ventilator

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,440
space since there are

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,039
just so many of them and there aren't

00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,760
just one or two that are really solving

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,080
the problem

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,080
that are able to to work together

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,520
whenever possible the way gnome and kde

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,799
have done for a long time

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,200
but um but uh but in fact the community

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,919
is

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,240
is is so fractured it's so difficult and

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,159
um

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,600
and part of it is also that there is a

00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,880
um

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:22,000
a uh you know a the

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,279
the manufacturers are are reluctant to

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,880
participate in

00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,399
free and open source software solutions

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,600
for a variety of reasons

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:32,320
um and uh this uh

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,760
but but there's this idea that we that

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,039
there's an obligation to share that

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,600
there's an obligation

00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,440
at least during the pandemic to help out

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,640
folks that don't have the resources and

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,399
this is a picture

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:47,600
of a uh ventilator where

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:52,080
where the manufacturer made the

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:55,600
um made the software available

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,799
on a non-commercial license and there

00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,480
have been a lot of examples of this

00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,799
during the pandemic so one of the wins

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,480
of the pandemic is this idea that people

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,039
have understood that they shouldn't be

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,159
holding back helping other people

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,200
in a in order to prop up proprietary

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,279
business models

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,799
but at the same time so there's this and

00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,919
there's a desire to share

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,640
but at the same time because this desire

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,600
to share

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,760
has not been articulated um in it with

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,760
the degree of depth that we understand

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,279
in the software freedom movement

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,120
there are a lot of these halfway

00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:31,120
solutions which are

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:33,440
applauded as being a fantastic step

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,240
steps forward and huge steps towards

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,559
sharing

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,559
and actually they're they're not really

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,600
they are short-term solutions that work

00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,360
as advertising

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,240
for the use of the products in the long

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,880
run and um and don't actually bring

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,399
any kind of self-actualization or any

00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,480
independence to

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,440
the the communities that will be relying

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,480
on them

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,399
so um you know this this this

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,840
i guess as with anything all of these

00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,640
wins and losses are deeply

00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,640
tied up together um and and and this is

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,440
one of those things and because

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,720
uh because there are a few people who

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,640
are articulating

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,760
why these um these narrow scope sharing

00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,279
licenses

00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:18,080
are problematic and how um you know

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:19,279
because no one's articulate articulating

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,600
that in the mainstream

00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,679
we're losing we've we're losing this

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,000
opportunity to bring these messages like

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,120
the idea to say yes this helps us with

00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,279
this pandemic

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,120
like with this pandoric situation today

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,840
but what about our next pandemic like if

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,760
we don't

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,039
democratize this technology we're just

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,159
going to be in the same situation the

00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,480
next time it happens

00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,520
or forget about a pandemic another

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,200
situation where

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,440
there's a problem where we're relying on

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,440
technology and communities don't have

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,880
control over it all over the world

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,200
you know how will we solve that problem

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,840
then the answer is to think holistically

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,960
about our technology instead of thinking

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,760
about it on this

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,720
piecemeal basis and demanding that

00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:00,159
companies are

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,640
more upfront about their technology and

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:06,159
that they

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:09,760
rely more on on sharing licenses

00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:12,720
so um so that was another um a

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,519
huge win and loss right um during the

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,279
pandemic

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,880
individuals have been under so much

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:20,240
stress and while

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:24,559
under ordinary circumstances um

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:28,080
abusers use um use smart home devices

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:32,320
to um to manipulate and

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:35,440
um and abuse their their partners

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:38,720
this became even more of

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:43,840
a situation during the pandemic where

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,840
when folks were stuck at home their

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,919
problems that that were uh were endemic

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,080
to

00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:54,000
um uh to chew home life became a lot

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:57,440
worse and so for example

00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,440
um domestic abuse rose worldwide during

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,799
covet 19 which is i think

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,120
not a um a huge surprise when you

00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,000
think about it but that means that our

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,559
technology

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,080
is is is more critical than ever and

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,279
educating people about how to control

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,279
their own technology

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,960
and also about coming together as

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,159
communities to be able to vet our

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,840
technology

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,600
and to provide us with the granulated

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:23,519
control that we deserve

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:26,559
has become all the more essential

00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,320
so you know obviously i think this is

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:32,000
just one of those situations where

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,799
um where it's it's it's one example of

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,840
how

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:37,679
um of how the pandemic

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,559
has brought out the the best and the

00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,840
worst of our society and of individuals

00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,919
and so

00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,120
people are are pointing to the

00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,279
inequality

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,120
that is exacerbated by the pandemic and

00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:53,120
this is across

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:56,159
all areas many people who

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,640
are uh who

00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,080
who are uh you know don't have as many

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,679
access to resources and who are

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,519
underprivileged to begin with

00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,679
are in a much worse situation during the

00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,360
pandemic it's the folks that have to

00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:10,080
go out and work jobs where they're

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:14,559
delivering food for example or

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:17,440
uh or interacting with people um

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,880
uh you know uh that have to that can't

00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,200
just stay at home the way that a lot of

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,840
our

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,360
our our tech workers are able to just

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,000
stay at home and hold up are much more

00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,159
vulnerable to

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,519
both contracting covadite and then also

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,120
having negative outcomes because

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,080
especially in places like the united

00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,640
states where i live

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,200
there is not even access to healthcare

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,399
and so

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,240
it's it's just deeply problematic

00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:40,080
because all of these inequalities that

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,559
we've already baked into our system

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,159
become

00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:46,799
even worse um and um

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,200
you know i i've i've been encouraged to

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,679
see

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,399
how many people in the software freedom

00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,159
community

00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,600
have been able to weather the storm

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,640
because they

00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,600
are able to um to hold up work on their

00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,559
tech jobs and um and and it's hard to be

00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,960
isolated

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,679
but they're able to protect themselves

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,840
and

00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,440
and their families and to be able to

00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,480
keep food on the table and to keep

00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,119
paying rent

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,679
um and that is simply not the case for

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,960
everyone

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:17,200
and we're still um you know all of these

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,159
opportunities that we've that we've we

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,440
have in tech

00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,960
are are generally have been um unevenly

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,359
available to people and so

00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,879
you know free software it clearly has

00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,639
the potential to provide

00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,079
opportunities and empower those who are

00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,159
disadvantaged it's one of the

00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,599
reasons why i feel so passionately about

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,639
software freedom is it it's about

00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:38,159
democratizing

00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:41,280
our technology but at the same time

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:44,159
i i i don't know if it actually is

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,480
is doing that because um we have not

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,520
done

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,399
a wonderful job of bringing education

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,560
and bringing

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,879
software freedom solutions to people who

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,639
are in disadvantaged communities

00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:56,000
we've had a lot of rhetoric about it but

00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,320
we have not

00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,119
necessarily been able to have that many

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,760
we haven't had that many successes in

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,280
in in actually taking action to spread

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,520
the access to software freedom and the

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,240
access to technology and using software

00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,240
freedom

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:15,040
as a mechanism for doing that um and so

00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,400
one of the the projects that conservancy

00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,839
is involved in um and

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:24,320
and and me personally and is

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:26,560
our ichi which was formed as the um

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,520
uh the outreach program for women when

00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,880
it was originally

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:34,160
uh uh conceived in the gnome community

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,720
and then um kde has been a

00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,880
participant over the years as well so

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,960
outreachy is an internship program that

00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,680
provides opportunities to

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,599
people who are impacted by systemic bias

00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,280
and who are underrepresented

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,720
and who are impacted by that under

00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,760
representation

00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:54,800
and so the program is run now such that

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:57,040
applicants write an essay to explain how

00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,040
they've experienced systemic bias how

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,640
they've been underrepresented and how

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,160
that affects their lives

00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:07,520
and so having this um

00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:09,920
having this this program

00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,280
became even more essential during the

00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,960
pandemic

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:18,400
our application rates

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,640
went through the roof and

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,960
and we've you know we've we've worked

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,960
really hard to try to expand

00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,440
the program during this time because we

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,720
see how essential it is we also

00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,480
um outreachy had a travel stipend built

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,079
into it where we encouraged people to go

00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,520
and attend free software conferences but

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,320
obviously since none of that is

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,480
happening now

00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,680
we turn that into stipends and we pay

00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,359
them out to

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,880
pass interns who could have traveled as

00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:45,119
well to help people

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,440
who have already documented themselves

00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,880
as being impacted by bias and under

00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,520
representation to help

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,960
weather through the storm and so um you

00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,320
know i'm proud that's something that

00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,160
that i've been involved with and we

00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,760
worked really hard to try to expand the

00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,440
program

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:04,160
so even though a lot of

00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,440
corporate funding has contracted during

00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,040
this time we've worked really hard to

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,720
try to increase fundraising so we could

00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,240
increase the number of interns

00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,599
uh that we have participating in

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,280
outreach and i'm really proud to say

00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,680
that we're about to announce that we

00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,400
have

00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,599
approximately uh 70 interns for the

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,000
current round which is

00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,119
the biggest round uh that we've done by

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,680
far

00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,480
usually we're at around 50 interns for a

00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,520
round and so

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:30,800
we we worked really really hard for that

00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:33,040
so um so someone's asking if

00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,079
people can read the papers of folks that

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,440
submitted

00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,680
their application if they could read

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,359
their um their applications and

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,760
um and no we don't make those public

00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:44,800
because uh i'm worried about

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,359
about uh we actually just uh we

00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,280
we delete as much information as we can

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,720
because we recognize that

00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,880
that all these essays and when you read

00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,680
them they are so there's so many of them

00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,680
contain

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,880
a lot of really personal personal

00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,640
information where people talk about

00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,920
their bad experiences and

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:06,640
it could be identifying so

00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,640
we don't want to we don't want to risk

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,560
exposing people's personal information

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,560
or inadvertently

00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,760
giving enough information that that

00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,480
someone could figure out who our

00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,240
applicants

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,960
were but but we work really hard to

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,880
evaluate

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:26,320
our essays and um

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:28,240
and uh uh as a as a consequence

00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,160
um you know feel feel really good about

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,720
that and so even though in this last

00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,280
round

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,880
um we can't we can't provide even though

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,839
we're providing a lot more internships

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,560
than we did

00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:40,320
um it's we're we're going to be unable

00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,640
to provide as many internships as i

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,119
would

00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,839
like to or as are needed there's a huge

00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,520
need

00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:48,720
right now um we had 3 000 applicants to

00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,920
outreachy over

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:54,560
the last round so i'm proud we can do

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,760
our part and and hopefully we can do

00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,040
more in the future

00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,000
um so that's uh you know that's where we

00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,359
are

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,280
with that but um but nonetheless um uh

00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,960
um i think one of the wins is that we

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,440
are able to scale up outreach and give

00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,599
people

00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,280
opportunities that they need um to be

00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,000
able to get into this situation where

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,880
they can

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,400
be one of the people who uh who has a

00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,000
comfortable tech job and can

00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,520
provide for their families without

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,599
having to risk

00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:25,200
um unsafe practices

00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,320
um and i'm being asked what our

00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,560
selection process is i don't want to get

00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,520
too into it because of this isn't a talk

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,880
about outreachy but

00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,920
um but we do have a really careful um

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,760
uh rubric that we use when we um

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,960
you know when we evaluate our our

00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,720
applications

00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:44,320
so um

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,000
one of the big wins to just move on to a

00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,079
slightly different topic

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,160
of the pandemic is that people really

00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:52,800
understand that they're reliant on tech

00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,000
in a way that they didn't before while i

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,119
think a lot of people thought of

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,640
software as a tool

00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,560
like they would look at like a hammer or

00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:01,680
something they looked at their um

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,280
their computers and their their handheld

00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,880
computers aka phones

00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,480
as if they were just these things that

00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,359
that you know they could use whenever

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,800
they felt like it

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,720
being in the pandemic made people

00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,319
realize how much they're reliant on it a

00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,200
lot of for a lot of people

00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:17,040
their phones and their computers were

00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,760
their only lifelines to the people they

00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,760
loved

00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,359
and so they realized that they are

00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,079
reliant on tech

00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,960
in ways that they they hadn't realized

00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,640
before

00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:31,119
um so uh you know that

00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,800
i i think that that is a huge win and i

00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,839
think people also in the pandemic

00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,359
realize

00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:39,119
you know as for example i have relatives

00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,960
that now

00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,800
use the word zoom bombing like they know

00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,680
what those things mean they understand

00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,359
that there are

00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,119
uh surveillance components to this

00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:50,800
technology and they understand

00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:51,359
how critical it is um that they shrug a

00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,760
little bit

00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:55,839
less than they used to about the fact

00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,480
that companies are collecting a

00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,280
tremendous amount of data on them so

00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,920
they

00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,560
they realize that they're more reliant

00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,200
um

00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:07,040
on technology than ever before it's like

00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,839
a completely different situation than it

00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:11,280
was

00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:13,920
um you know even two or three years ago

00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,400
and i have far-flung relatives who are

00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,520
um

00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:20,000
you know non-technical or just

00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,359
never saw despite every time me talking

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,800
about software freedom as best as i

00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,440
could at family functions and things

00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,839
like that

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,720
um finally over the last year texting me

00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,880
and saying

00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,040
um or or emailing me and saying i'm so

00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,960
glad you introduced me to these ideas

00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,359
before i started reading all of these

00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,359
articles because now i see that these

00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:39,119
issues are really important and i'm so

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:42,240
glad you've been working on it and so

00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,520
it's it's fascinating and

00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,359
and it means that we're in a really

00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,839
exciting time where there is a lot of

00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:50,240
opportunity

00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:52,240
um uh and i think that

00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,079
the the part of the problem is that is

00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,000
that folks are really beaten down

00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,359
by um by the fact that they have no

00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,119
choice with respect to these

00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:01,040
technologies so they know that they're

00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,400
reliant on them and they can see their

00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,520
use of their technology in a way they

00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,000
never did before

00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,880
but they're every bit is feeling like

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,560
they don't have

00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,079
that much control there is that power

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,040
dynamic right and they're not in the

00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,160
power seat

00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,119
um this is a a slide i like because it

00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,440
has a picture of

00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,280
an art exhibit where this artist put out

00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,800
the like printed out the terms and

00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,800
conditions on different colored papers

00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,599
for different

00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,240
common services that people use um and

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,079
uh

00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,599
there was a study done that showed that

00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,000
you would have to do nothing for a

00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,920
full-time

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,359
job except read these terms of services

00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,960
for three months

00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,560
before you could read just the terms of

00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,359
service that the average person agrees

00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,119
to

00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:40,960
in the ordinary online services that

00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,800
they provide and they've become

00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,480
desensitized to them we all have we all

00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,839
just click agree

00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,359
just i agree um because you don't really

00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:51,520
have a choice and when someone's invited

00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:53,920
you to a teleconference and you have to

00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,040
set up an account and agree to terms

00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,200
you're going to do that

00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,480
before the conference starts right

00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,319
you're not going to have time to

00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,160
consider and read all of these terms of

00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,640
services and we're not doing a great job

00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,560
as

00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,319
a society at putting these things in

00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,760
check um

00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:10,720
so so i think that there's this is sort

00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,359
of the downside

00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,400
of that and so one of the things that

00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:18,079
i've been working on

00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:20,240
with um with molly de blanc is to create

00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:23,359
a declaration of digital autonomy

00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:26,560
where we look holistically at all of the

00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:28,319
um uh at what are

00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,400
our what what we rely on for our

00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,200
technology and um and coming up with

00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,040
principles

00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,240
so that we can evaluate our technology

00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:37,359
and demand that we

00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:39,640
have um uh we have better

00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:41,119
so um so i recommend checking out

00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:44,319
techautonomy.org

00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,359
and um and uh you know let us know if

00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,280
you have any

00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,560
any suggestions or feedback i think that

00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,400
would be really uh it would be really

00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:53,119
helpful it's just a it's just a draft

00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,880
um and um and so we've got um we really

00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:57,200
want to get input from people

00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,560
um about what what should be better we

00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,440
haven't been thinking about our

00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,599
technology

00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,560
as holistically as we should we suffer

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,680
freedom advocates

00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:07,040
have been siloed in our space and and

00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,319
other people who are

00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:12,560
focused on um

00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:14,480
we're focused on other areas of ethical

00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,520
technology are siloed in their spaces

00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,720
and we need to

00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,640
do more work about that i've been doing

00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,280
that in the medical devices space as

00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,960
recently

00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,280
as five years ago i didn't even know

00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,319
there's there's a you know there's a

00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:29,359
a um an advocate

00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:30,079
who uh whose name is hugo campus who has

00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:33,200
the same

00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,720
heart condition as me um he has exactly

00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,680
the same condition as me

00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,880
but he is uh he advocates for patient

00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,760
access to data

00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,240
and you know there are the folks that

00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,760
are

00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,319
doing the hacking work on medical

00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,920
devices and we until somewhat recently

00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:49,920
we're not well communicated with each

00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,560
other at all so we need to do more of

00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,400
that

00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,760
organizing and communication so that we

00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,119
all work together and think about our

00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,560
technology as holistically

00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,680
because otherwise software freedom is

00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,400
not going to be a part of that

00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,240
discussion

00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,920
and we have to articulate why software

00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,520
freedom is important as part of that

00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,960
whole

00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,880
as part of that whole discussion and

00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,119
frame it that way

00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,720
so that we can bring the discussion to

00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,720
something that we can actually act on

00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:17,359
um one of the biggest wins in the

00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,200
pandemic is that we

00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,400
in the free software community we're

00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,920
here for each other

00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,599
we're a community that talks to each

00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:28,000
other that knows how to communicate

00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:31,200
but also we care about each other so

00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,599
um so you know i think that that is just

00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,119
uh

00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:34,960
like one of the things that's the most

00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,240
powerful during the um during the

00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,599
pandemic to remember

00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,000
that we've set up these great

00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:41,920
communities and we support each other

00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,200
we at conservancy have chats every

00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,920
thursday

00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,280
and that will happen in two hours a

00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,359
little bit over two hours in the

00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,640
conservancy irc channel

00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:52,640
so um

00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,119
and um and i welcome you to join and the

00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,040
idea is just

00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,720
just a place to chat we talk about

00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,920
important software freedom issues but

00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,040
also just

00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,040
just hang out on irc

00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:12,240
um yeah there's some just i was

00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,720
distracted trying to look for a moment

00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,839
at the

00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:17,359
chat in the sidebar to um

00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,880
to answer some of those questions but i

00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:20,079
don't see that anyway so coming back

00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,160
around because we're getting to the end

00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:24,800
of this and supporting each other

00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:26,400
nobody guessed the right conference at

00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,200
the beginning of the talk

00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,640
the talk the of the conference that i

00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,839
linked to was the desktop

00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:36,240
summit in gran canaria in 2009 which is

00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:39,359
one of the very first conferences that

00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,000
um that i i participated wholeheartedly

00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,520
in

00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,680
and it was really fun for me because i

00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,920
was a lawyer to both kde

00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,200
and um and gnome at my in that at that

00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,000
time i was still at the software freedom

00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,400
law center

00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,079
um and it was super fun to flip between

00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,720
the gnome community and the kde

00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,480
community

00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,560
and the reason why i'm coming back to

00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:59,920
that is that in 2009

00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:03,040
in gran canaria i felt like

00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,440
i i honestly at that point i had felt

00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,240
like

00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,280
i was coming to suffer freedom too late

00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,520
i felt like

00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,319
everything had happened already i felt

00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,319
like

00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:13,920
like oh if i'd only been there in you

00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:17,440
know in

00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,000
in 2000 in you know 2002 2000 if i'd

00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,599
only

00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
had the confidence when i first started

00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:23,520
participating in 2005 to become more

00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,440
involved and to do more

00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:29,520
uh you know i felt like you know like

00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,960
like i had missed it it all happened all

00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,760
the important things were done

00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,760
and looking back that is so laughable

00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,240
like there is absolutely

00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,640
there's so much has happened in in in

00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:44,559
the in the time since then and i wish

00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:48,000
that i had realized that um

00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,720
i wish i had realized that um at that

00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,920
desktop

00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:53,359
in gran canaria that so much would

00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,359
happen and that everyone who was there

00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:56,000
was a part of it and so if this is your

00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,960
first

00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,760
conference um if las is your first

00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,480
conference

00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,520
or if um if you you've started quite

00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,839
recently

00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,119
don't feel like your opinion doesn't

00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:10,160
matter and don't feel

00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:12,400
like uh like so much has has already

00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,000
happened and you've missed it because

00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,760
what matters is what's happening right

00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,559
now if we've learned anything from the

00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,040
pandemic

00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,240
it's that uh and richard cushing i'm so

00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,240
glad you're here for this being your

00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:25,359
first conference that is so cool

00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:28,480
um uh and and matthias

00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:30,640
uh gides too fantastic so

00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,079
like the main the if we learn anything

00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,000
from the pandemic is that we don't know

00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,599
what's coming down the road we

00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,920
have to be ready we have to work

00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,960
together and we are constantly need to

00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,480
iterate the

00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,920
what we're doing for software freedom to

00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,520
get people to understand it and to make

00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,319
a world where we can rely on our

00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,520
technology

00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:48,319
better and i'm so hoping that i can see

00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,119
all of you

00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:51,520
soon in person so that we can meet and

00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,200
have

00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,200
those kinds of fantastic personal

00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,920
dynamics that we have when we get

00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,839
together

00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,160
but i know that the fact that we can

00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:03,760
participate here and now and

00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:07,119
here and also uh charles uh sirois

00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,960
or syrah i'm glad you're here too and so

00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,559
um i look forward to meeting you all and

00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,319
seeing you all thank you so much for

00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:14,800
participating this because together

00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:16,960
we will figure out what we've learned

00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,440
from the pandemic we will celebrate our

00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,359
wins

00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,040
learn from our losses and be better

00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,480
together so

00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,880
thank you so much for listening and i'm

00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,319
gonna see if there's time for

00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,160
um i think i answered most of the

00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:31,280
questions as they came up in

00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:34,400
the um

00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,880
uh in the chat i think christy said

00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,000
there were

00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,960
shared notes very strange giving

00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,119
conversation

00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:45,760
giving like a talk to like just seeing

00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:47,760
myself and not anybody else

00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,240
yeah and i think that one of the

00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,720
questions is also interesting because

00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,720
it says that you think uh so i'm going

00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,960
first with the first question

00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,079
how and why do you think we failed in

00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,960
the adaptation of this

00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,559
different free and open tools so maybe

00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,440
that's somehow related

00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:06,480
to the beginning of your presentation if

00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,440
you'd like we can

00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,200
first answer this yeah i mean i think i

00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,720
covered that i think we were ready with

00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,079
our technological solutions and we were

00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,040
ready with our rhetoric but we didn't

00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,200
bring it together

00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,319
we didn't provide the infrastructure and

00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,880
we didn't

00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:22,400
uh advertise it in a coordinated way at

00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,359
the beginning of the pandemic

00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,200
we didn't empower individuals and we

00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:28,160
were all struggling independently to try

00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,920
to deal with

00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,000
our own personal issues during the

00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,359
pandemic i know anybody who was a parent

00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,680
had little kids that were home all the

00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:36,880
time

00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,000
anyone who um you know anyone who has an

00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,559
underlying condition

00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,760
was terrified that we were gonna get

00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,319
sick and many people were

00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,680
dealing with being sick um and dealing

00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:47,440
with loved ones who were sick and so

00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,359
there were significant challenges

00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,640
but i think that we should what we can

00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:53,599
do is we can learn from that

00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,000
and come up with with a more coordinated

00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,000
way

00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,200
of of dealing with these issues in the

00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,119
future

00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,640
and it's in part in coming together in

00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:01,440
conferences but it's also through a lot

00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,800
of collection

00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,319
collective action and having our

00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:09,839
rhetoric ready for the next time that it

00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:09,839
happens as well as our solutions

00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,920
great the second question do you think

00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,800
adoption

00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:19,359
of remote tools will stay for future

00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,040
false events after the pandemic ends

00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:23,359
considering from a point of view where

00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:26,319
it helps spread out the word for people

00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:27,680
who are unable to travel yes i think

00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:29,119
that we've learned a lot from that in

00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,319
that regard too is i think that we're

00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,920
going to continue to provide

00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:33,920
better mechanisms for people to

00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,440
participate remotely and so having

00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,480
conferences where there's a

00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,079
hybrid component um is really good i

00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,720
think one of the things that i loved is

00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:43,280
that that i

00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,920
i i might do more of in the future is

00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,920
having

00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,680
uh and we might do a conservancy is

00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,880
having pre-recorded talks where

00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:52,800
the speaker can engage with um with

00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,160
questions during the talk

00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,160
as i said at the beginning to heckle

00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:58,400
themselves which is a

00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,520
a you know pretty silly way of referring

00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,359
to it but but

00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,800
i think that a lot of those mechanisms

00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:04,480
to the extent that we're doing remote

00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,240
events will stick and i think that

00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,319
having remote sessions that are tacked

00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,680
onto in-person conferences

00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:11,839
will be essential and i hope that all

00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:14,559
the conference organizers continue to

00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:14,559
evaluate that

00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:20,800
i see there's a question about gpl or

00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,480
later

00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,400
um which i think is really out of scope

00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,640
for this so

00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,640
um

00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:32,319
uh oh but that was the end of the

00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:36,559
questions these the rest of these were

00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:36,559
uh were for the previous talk

00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:41,119
yes so i guess that we have we had these

00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:45,760
two questions

00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:46,160
the the shared notes for you to answer

00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,440
uh

00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:52,000
thank you so so much for joining us

00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,720
for joining us on this lesson really

00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,960
hope to see you in person soon

00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,559

00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,880
it and to all of the organizers you are

00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:02,000

00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:05,680

00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,760
so um i think everybody give your
