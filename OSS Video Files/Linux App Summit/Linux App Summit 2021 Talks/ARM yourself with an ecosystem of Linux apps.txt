Title: ARM yourself with an ecosystem of Linux apps
Publication date: 2021-05-30
Playlist: Linux App Summit 2021 Talks
Description: 
	Soon the likes of Apple’s M1 chip won’t cost an ARM and a leg. In the not too distant future adding ARM support to your applications is going to be crucial for reaching users, both old and new.

ARM hardware is cropping up in more and more places, it’s not just for embedded devices anymore. ARM clouds have been around for a while and we’re seeing the first serious workstations from Apple. Before NVIDIA brings ARM into every developer's life, let me tell you Ubuntu’s plan for support and how you can start testing and developing for ARM, using the software and the workflows you’re used to, today.

Q&A


    1. What apps do you think are ideal for new/beginning developers to convert or create? Either existing apps or general classes of apps.
    
    2. So in reality the new Ubuntu installer that you guys at Canonical are writting in Flutter and thats gonna be released in the future is gonna work on the baked raspberry pie
have you considered that?
    
    3. Where can I find other people who are packaging Snaps, who could help me debug Snaps that I'm packaging?

thank you i'm not sure who

00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,480
um put the scheduling together but next

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,160
time i think i'll

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,519
ask to go before richard because that

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,600
was very good

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,560
um so from one random english bloke to

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,920
another

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,840
uh first i want to say thank you

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,439
everyone for staying uh so long i know

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,039
if this was in person

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,039
uh conference everyone would have gotten

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,880
a drink at the break before last so

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,640
while i introduced myself please feel

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,480
free to get yourself a beer or some

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,719
non-alcoholic beverage before i start

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,800
chatting away and this is the last talk

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,320
so i'm i'm thinking of it for myself as

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,000
a sort of closing keynote

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,640
for my own ego but really it's just the

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,120
last talk um

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,520
uh so i'll just uh i'll just get started

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,840
the title of this talk as you can see is

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,960
on yourself with an ecosystem of linux

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,680
apps

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,559
uh soon the abstract for this talk was

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,960
soon the likes

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,559
of apple's m1 chip won't cost an arm and

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,719
a leg

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,079
uh in the not too distant future adding

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,039
arm support to your applications is

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,280
going to be crucial

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,720
for reaching users both old and new and

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,799
with everything happening

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,320
uh with apple and within within

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,119
acquisition of the arm by

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,520
nvidia potentially coming soon i wanted

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,439
to talk a little bit about ubuntu's plan

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,680
for support and how you can start

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,200
testing and developing for um

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,119
using software and workflows that you're

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,159
using today already

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,400
uh so let me just close the chat here so

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,400
i don't get too distracted

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,920
um and we can dive

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,200
in next slide okay cool so

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,840
uh first i'll tell you a little bit

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,000
about myself i'm rhys davis i'm a

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,360
developer advocate for ubuntu for

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,079
canonical

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,479
i've been in this role for a few months

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,799
now

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,040
where i've joined the community team the

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,360
rebooted community team i should say

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,439
economically focusing specifically on

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,079
supporting and helping the

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,360
community grow and and enable them to do

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,360
things

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,960
uh and before that i was a product

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,719
manager for canonical

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,880
for about a year and a half where i

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,560
looked after numerous different products

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,120
over there from robotics and iot type

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,920
things

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,360
and snaps to a little bit of desktop a

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,120
little bit of multi-pass some

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,879
virtualization stacks

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,160
that kind of thing so i i covered a lot

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,800
of the landscape and

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,480
along the way i very much drank the open

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,000
source kool-aid

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,520
and and it was part of the reason i

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,800
joined the company and drawing canonical

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,160
in the first place but then

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,760
the more i got into it the more i

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,400
enjoyed the more i saw the value and

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,440
what

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,480
folks like you do and what what open

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,400
source is about

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,879
and obviously principles and i uh i

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,640
really really sort of got inspired

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,959
and then a little a couple of other

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,239
things about me uh i like books i like

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,840
reading i'm a bit of a

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,440
big book nerd when it comes to reading

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,800
and writing uh i

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,040
joined the circus for a few months not

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,840
terribly long ago i ran away with the

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,160
circus and

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,800
the little groovy gorilla down there was

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,200
uh the eventual release that i last

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,319
sort of led in a little ubuntu t-shirt

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,000
here

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,680
um i just want to say as well before i

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,680
get into the rest uh

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,519
the meat of the presentation while

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,640
richard's story before me was very good

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,560
and very interesting

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,400
and very real mine's a bit more of a

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,080
fall experiment a bit more of a

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,959
fiction so um yeah

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,959
let's go

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,599
all right uh the animations didn't work

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,599
terribly well okay

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,280
uh once upon a time so yeah so i'm gonna

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,200
be telling you a little bit of a story

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,519
so uh bear with me if it starts to get a

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,720
bit weird once upon a time in a hole in

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,680
the ground in a cupboard under the

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,120
stairs

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:42,799
uh in a galaxy far far away or on github

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,879
i want everybody to imagine a developer

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,280
she is like many of us maybe she has a

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,720
job maybe she works for a tech company

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,040
maybe she works in a corner shop it

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,920
doesn't really matter uh but she's just

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,200
getting started

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,959
in app development uh let's let's

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,720
let's say she spends her time surfing

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,239
the web scrolling through projects

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,400
looking at open source repo is looking

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,080
for something to contribute to

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,480
and and she has an idea she wants to

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,560
build an app whatever that app is

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,519
it doesn't matter let's just say as any

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,120
app

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,280
for now let's say it's a command line

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,599
tool that and attracts the

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,720
stocks that she's invested in we'll call

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,840
it stonker

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,359
uh just for the sake of this

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,880
presentation since it's the last one and

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,240
we can have a little bit of fun

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,840
that was supposed to be an animation on

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,160
the screen so it's a bit of a surprise

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,720
but

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,080
there we are uh she does this in her

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,400
free time

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,000
after work on the weekends uh she really

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,639
wants to build something of it

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,639
uh help people track their stonks uh

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,199
maybe she wants to road maps and work to

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,120
add

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,639
a feature to crawl reddit for the next

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,680
opportunity to stick it to the man in

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,600
the future

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,520
maybe even build a community around her

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,080
app but that's all down the road

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,199
her first problem is just where to start

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,400
for the sake of this

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,800
uh story for the sake of this

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,280
presentation let's say this is her first

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,520
time

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,199
developing an app an open source app

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,280
that way we can look at

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,720
what's out there a little bit more and

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,400
really dig into

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,800
a first-timer's experience and really

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,560
examine the whole process a little bit

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,720
i'm sure we've all been there i know i

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,479
have where we have this idea maybe a

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,560
project idea maybe something

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,160
we want to contribute to and we go

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,400
hunting for where to start

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,520
where to begin how to begin quite

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,000
importantly

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,800
uh and well so let's have a look at what

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,080
she might

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,280
find ah

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,880
uh here we see our first sort of

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:34,160
uh plot twist um how do you

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:37,199
how do you get started well where you

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,960
where would you begin yeah i think

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,960
we need more articles about this kind of

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,880
thing about where where to begin with

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,919
with linux apps if you just search how

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,440
to develop an app if you don't know

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,039
anything about linux and for this

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,639
case obviously we're assuming that we

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,400
don't know anything about limits

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,800
you would get you would find yourself in

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,479
a rabbit hole of mobile apps

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,600
i didn't take any screenshots only

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,600
because it looked a little bit weird on

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,840
the slide so i did what we did here

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,000
uh i apologize for the funky colors i'm

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,360
not i'm not a designer

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,720
this is no other filters of course if

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,400
she knew she was interested in linux

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,479
maybe she would have added linux but

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,919
maybe she wouldn't as well if she went

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,759
off on her first search

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,360
uh here she'd end up down the mobile app

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,680
rabbit hole and would have found their

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,800
way

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,840
and found her way to ios or android

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,840
long before she would have thought about

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
linux

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,199
it seems like it seems like any bloggers

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,759
out there

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,280
have a nice seo target with this even

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,400
when i search desktop as you can see

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,639
here specifically

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,600
it was all windows documentation and

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,080
that's windows

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,680
documentation and in in my personal

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,240
opinion those docs aren't particularly

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,120
good

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,639
and very attractive looking so this is

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,000
sort of my first call to action i'll get

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,720
into the point of this talk in a second

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,759
i promise

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,440
um we need more visibility on

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,440
developing linux apps in terms of

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,919
documentation and writing and

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,759
blog posts and people talking about it

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,400
if we want first timers to go down the

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,360
goods

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,120
happy linux rabbit hole and i think we

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,039
do

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,800
let's start targeting getting started

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,240
blogs specific keywords

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,080
or building up the google juice

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,199
weightings of sites that are doing this

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,919
already

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,440
i'm not sure if you'll get these slides

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,560
after the event or not but there's a

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,280
nice url

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,960
at the bottom of it you can see there of

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,840
the search results that only came up

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,360
when i looked for

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,639
which was the only linux related thing

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,280
that i came up when i searched this

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,840
actually

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,520
which was make a linux dot app which was

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,919
some of you would have seen it before

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,440
or even maybe even had a hand in in

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,120
building it but it's a place to go a

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,599
place to start

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,280
uh it's this is exactly the kind of

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,720
thing that we're looking for

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,520
uh in terms of distribution of of people

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,120
but we also

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,560
need people talking about the apps that

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,080
they're making and conferences like this

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,560
are an awesome awesome

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,080
awesome thing for doing that um it just

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,120
needs to translate into

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,720
into google juice right uh my my contact

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,400
details at the end of this presentation

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,479
if you're writing a linux apps

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,080
blog or creating linux app content and

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,560
would like a hand optimizing this kind

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,759
of thing

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,400
just let me know anyway this is the

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,879
linux

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,120
app summit so let's move past this let's

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,800
say she finds her way to open source

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,319
maybe to linux but more importantly she

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,479
finds a way to open source

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,400
communities somewhere she can do her

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,280
work in the open and if she runs into

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,039
issues

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,599
there are active forums for questions

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,199
and uses for contributions

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,120
she hasn't got time for courses let's

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,879
say she just wants to get stuck in

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,160
so she looks for tutorials right

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,360
documentation maybe

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,440
youtube videos surely i know i would

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,039
now this is where we need a little bit

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,159
of suspension of disbelief

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,159
and she's reading through the

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,919
documentation she's watching the youtube

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,080
videos getting inspired

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,760
there's a lot of interesting things

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,360
going on but in her search

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,279
she's looking for something new

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,720
something exciting something that she

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,920
can get ahead of and really try

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,600
something

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,160
now this is a bit of a jump but maybe

00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:00,160
she sees certain developers she follows

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,160
on twitter say raving about the m1 chip

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,800
it's more specifically she finds maybe

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,519
the apple macbook air

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,399
with an m1 chip uh the people talking

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,760
about that

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,120
for better or for worse oh she thinks

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,920
right it's the new shiny

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,640
it's interesting it's performant okay

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,360
it's apple

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,320
yeah blah blah blah it's expensive which

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,600
is a pain

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,920
it's got an arm processor hello

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,240
that's interesting she realizes wait a

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,519
minute and what would have to be

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,320
that would have to be a whole new class

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,320
of application right it would have to be

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,519
built for this hardware built for arm

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,000
hardware

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,800
so she searches um so she searches

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,080
around

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,920
what's up with art right and uh no no

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,519
no no we don't let's try arm silicon

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:51,040
because this isn't what we're here for

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,040
um ah it was all apple

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,480
apps on arm silicon just gives you

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,959
everything apple or at least it did for

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,839
me

00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:00,240
in my location uh now that's doing a

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,760
good job of articles apple have really

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,600
sort of cornered this one

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,200
maybe if there are any amongst any

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,360
people out there amongst you

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,480
who want to start writing documentation

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,279
or tutorials for the next app

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,320
development on

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,640
arm this is another sort of seo sort of

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,000
google target for you and again i'd be

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,640
happy to help

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,480
juicing those articles for google

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,360
because it looks like we need a lot more

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,079
visibility for the apps keyword in

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,079
general

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,120
but let's say for the sake of priority

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,600
she finds herself

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,519
on the nvidia news right she goes

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,000
looking for an arm specific content

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,560
and perhaps the fable algorithm throws

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,880
up a

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,839
news article now of course she's heard

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,560
of nvidia right

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,200
who hasn't she knows they do crazy gpu

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,440
stuff

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:48,880
right cool videos acquiring arm

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,839
oh now that's something she picks up on

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,920
that's something that's quite

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,279
interesting

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,480
[Music]

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,880
uh blink next slide okay so

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,519
this could be serious right not just not

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,360
just sort of fruit associated with apple

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,640
oh wait okay so she realizes the

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,560
implications of this

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,160
even if we just zoom in on linux and

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,399
desktop applications

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,920
if folks like apple are already moving

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,160
towards desktop class

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,000
arm hardware you can bet your bottom

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,680
dollar other hardware vendors are

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,160
working on it too

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,920
equally you can bet nvidia have noticed

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,480
i've seen a lot of good things about

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,120
it uh but that's really matter the point

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,120
is

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,519
with arm a company partners with just

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,320
about everybody microsoft intel qualcomm

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,640
apple amazon ibm nintendo

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,959
and so on on embedded devices getting

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,040
leveled up by sort of invidious gpus and

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,720
servers and supercomputer stacks

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,240
you can be sure that embedded devices

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,000
will get smarter

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,600
and workstation vendors will be able to

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,279
leverage that technology

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,680
and it means that linux will be coming

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,680
to embedded devices and armed desktops

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,600
certainly which is um which is all on

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,320
its way right

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,200
so what's missing over there as ever

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,240
it's apps

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,519
right building new or adapting old linux

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,440
apps for arm

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,880
is going to become uh crucial

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,800
and she recognizes this let's say she

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,839
recognizes this in our presentation

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,800
so she thinks okay what else is um how

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,279
can we learn more

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,480
so she discovers um is typically for the

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,079
embedded space

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,880
right okay phones nice fridges it's cool

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,440
tablets that's interesting iot devices

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,079
that's

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,639
buzzwordy but where's the innovation

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,120
right now

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,760
she looks around and it's cloud right

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,880
amazon

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,560
graviton two there's a two edge compute

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,399
clustering blah blah blah

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,320
okay she's convinced there's a there's

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,639
definitely a future in this

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,000
so she decides to dig in now i'm aware

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,519
this isn't normally how

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,920
application development goes people

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,040
don't usually um

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,120
people usually decide on the

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,160
architecture first i'd presume i'm not a

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,200
developer so i wouldn't know

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,160
specifically but just

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,399
bear with me we'll we'll get to that um

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,760
so she wants to start developing

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,600
for a for this shall we say non-standard

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,800
architecture of desktop maps so she

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,160
definitely wants to do that

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,600
but she wants to get ahead of the curve

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,120
you know break new ground maybe she

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,079
could turn it into a mobile or embed it

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,720
up later

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,320
on the face of it it looks hard

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,079
especially to a beginner there's not a

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,880
lot of tutorials or examples out there

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,600
at the moment

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,959
and as we've seen what does exist is

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,639
apple

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,399
maybe there are paid for courses but

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,480
that's no good to her maybe it becomes

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,920
expensive you very quickly find articles

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,639
telling you that you need

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,920
an armed device to build arm on does

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,040
that mean she has to buy

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,959
the m1 to develop desktop apps does that

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,720
mean you have to build in the cloud

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,560
is there no way around that or is there

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,880
no way to build for arm

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,320
on another architecture okay so he

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,720
thinks okay okay okay

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,399
this is a lot uh so she thinks let's try

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,480
and start at the bottom right

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,680
i'm as a company maybe they have a place

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,680
to start

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:58,079
okay good they do

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,680
uh there's forums there's docs perfect

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,279
so you have a scroll through

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,959
but it's a lot about embedded stuff not

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,079
necessarily applications but there's no

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,240
need to panic

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,440
there's a linux section okay it's not

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,440
super helpful but

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,560
right linux linux arm is still very

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,760
embedded apps are a couple of layers up

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,880
yes this is a good sign um have their

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,639
docs ready

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,000
there's a lot of debugging and docker

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,560
but not so much

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,720
for what she's looking for just yet so

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,880
she she goes looking for linux apps

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,560
and i'm pleased to say she found this

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,800
conference when she was looking for

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,720
for linux apps but since this talk is

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,959
about linux apps for arm let's

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,399
let's focus over there and what i mean

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,040
by that is when i've searched

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,680
um for linux apps i found references to

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,839
this conference

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,040
that's that's very very good so the

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,480
first thing she finds

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,560
is uh a reddit threat

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,680
talking about ubuntu and i thank

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,560
goodness for that since

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,480
you know that's what i'm advocating for

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,120
and then later on there is a thread on

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,639
this website

00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,560
raspberrypi.org which is interesting she

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,199
thinks maybe there's like a super active

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,399
niche community for making baking apps

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,279
yeah i know

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,320
uh i know she would know about the

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,760
raspberry pi

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,360
unless she was living under a bridge but

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,680
jokes about baked goods are fun and i'm

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,639
pretty sure those guys like it

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,639
so she thinks to herself

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,880
can i do this can she do it can

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,560
can you get ahead of this kind of curve

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,040
and write applications for arm

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,079
that will run on graviton and that will

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,880
run on the

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,759
the m1 chip apps that cater for the

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,160
incoming

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,880
um based future if if that if that

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,199
happens

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,079
maybe she can get ahead of the army apps

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,839
ecosystem

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,839
maybe she would make um the first class

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,680
citizen of her app but of course

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,440
build for build up and around on other

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,040
architectures as well

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,120
maybe she could even write tutorials and

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,480
documentation and become something of an

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,320
influencer in this space before it

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,880
really even takes off

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,079
it's safe to say i think that pretty

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,120
soon arm-based

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,639
hardware won't cost an arm and a leg

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,800
and it doesn't even at the moment right

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,480
and nvidia may well bring it to every

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,120
developer on the planet

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,959
and they're not terribly distant future

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,199
so can she do this

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,240
spoiler alert for this fictitious talk

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,519
she can

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,000
but she needs to start making some

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,000
decisions

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,360
uh let's open some arm docks in tabs

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,360
that will likely never close

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,800
until our computer crashes and every

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,440
other thing we find

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,639
linked to all over the shop um ubuntu

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,240
there are links to snapcraft and

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,680
launchpad on the screen here

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,079
but we'll get to that stuff later don't

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,040
worry github raspberry pi

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,600
okay so she thinks next let's get

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,759
ourselves

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,959
into the forums and over onto the

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,360
youtubes

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,040
maybe she spots this new arm software

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,000
developers channel

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,800
which you can see on screen here this is

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,160
a neat

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,079
little software developers youtube

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,480
channel from the advocacy or the

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,399
the developer relations teams over there

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,160
at arm and it talks about what's going

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,440
on with them what partners and community

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,720
people are doing

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,480
and what they're working on and most

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,000
importantly it's talks about developing

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,760
software for arm

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,959
they have a series on game development

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,839
at the moment they do live streams it's

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,679
pretty cool

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,919
okay it doesn't matter i'm not okay

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,839
anyway uh so she finds that

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,520
uh that's a good thing that's good

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,880
that's good interesting stuff that's arm

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,160
support

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,400
that's the arm knowledge taken into

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,640
account and then

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,480
she looks to learn more about ubuntu is

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,720
nice and it's free and it's good and

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,640
there are two images for r that's good

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,760
for if she wants to to start developing

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,520
natively

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,360
she pops into the video discourse to see

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,960
what's going on it's a very active

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,240
discourse lots of people talking about

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,000
lots of different things

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,760
well there's not an arm specific section

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,960
there is a desktop category where people

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,120
talk every day

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,400
in a community category which is where i

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,480
live

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,480
uh where she can raise her ideas and

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,919
talk about what she wants to

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,919
what she wants to do and how she wants

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,720
to contribute

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,559
great okay that's the architecture and

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,400
linux taken care of

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,160
but i think but there's something in

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,640
between right

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,440
okay good there is support for the baked

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,919
goods

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,039
in ubuntu that's good there is a

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,320
raspberry pi support

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,919
uh when she wants dessert i mean testing

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,720
and there's a community here of

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,960
developers to help with issues

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,400
okay stepping back she's got ubuntu

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,240
raspberry pi

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,840
uh yes and both of those things are in

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,240
as expensive as it's going to get anyway

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,799
so

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,720
that's that's something uh and it's

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,280
perfect for testing arm applications and

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,480
there's

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:35,360
been to support uh great

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,400
we're ready to go reading around on

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,000
ubuntu and getting

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,000
up into one of raspberry pi she runs

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,120
into these snap things

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,919
she reads she reads she reads

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,799
packaging write an app package it and

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,240
build it to run

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:52,720
on a heap of architectures including oh

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,280
okay she can do this she can see the

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,480
path so she writes her stonker app

00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:02,400
yeah i remember it's called stonker

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,400
okay like i said i'm not a

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,400
i get the idea here and developers on

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,840
their apps etc but

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,840
i'm not

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,600
so so let's

00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:31,520
supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,520
and it's about done she's written

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,640
okay so for the sake of this talk we'll

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,720
say she used

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,960
flutter just uh quickly for those who

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,640
don't know floater flutter is a google

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,160
a google's ui toolkit for building

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,520
natively compiled applications for

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,520
mobile web and desktop

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:55,360
she's focused on but

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,039
cross platform and multi-platform

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,039
support is always a win

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,840
of course it could be some other nice

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,840
crop cross

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,559
it's maybe it's electron if you're

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:09,760
interested in electron instead

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,400
um i hope i'm saying your name right

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,480
pradeep

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,679
gave a very interesting talk on building

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,000
apps with electron

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,760
earlier earlier today i think that was

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,360
today so maybe she would find that

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,400
documentation instead it really doesn't

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,080
matter

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,840
let's see let's say she wrote it on on

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,799
her ubuntu workstation

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,600
because come on i work for chronicle and

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,799
she used

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,480
uh vs cody no that's not uh that's

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,400
codium not vs code

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,640
kodi m is not a fork it's a repository

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,679
of scripts to automatically build

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,440
microsoft's vs code into freely licensed

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,840
binaries with a community driven

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,520
uh configuration uh you should

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,600
absolutely check it out and just

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,039
and just like that she's ready to go she

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,240
can build a ramification

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,600
and get things going now i know i

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,080
skipped over those two things quite

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,320
quickly

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,440
flutter and vs kodium but like i said

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,120
i'm not a developer

00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,240
and we're focused on the higher level

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,760
sort of story journey here

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,159
um there's more information about

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,240
flutter on the ubuntu blog

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,360
uh vs codium is a snap you can find in

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,760
the snapstore

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,799
and there's uh lots of talks at this

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,200
conference alone

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,840
that you could watch for example like i

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,120
mentioned

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,640
already mentioned um or maybe tobias's

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,400
talk at the very very beginning on

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,600
adaptive apps with gtk

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,520
so lots of options i'm not recommending

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,600
necessarily these things it's just

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,080
these are the options that um that i

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:33,280
would have gone for let's say

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,799
so we have stonker on github maybe i

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,799
shouldn't have called it stonker

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,960
uh it's an open source project because

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,559
of course it is and maybe it has one or

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,200
two other contributors

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,799
who helped her out in the forums okay

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,720
great but really

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,679
that's the fun part the fun part done

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:53,039
right the bulk of the work is done

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,080
oh dear uh she thinks deploying linux

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,360
apps

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,440
is she going to start thinking about

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,240
packaging now okay okay

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,280
she holds her breath and she dives it

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,200
but of course not

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,799
helpful commentary starts to get a

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,400
little bit less responsive

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,520
linux apps are great that's why we're

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,440
all here right that's why this

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,600
conference is named after them

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:16,080
linux packaging is typically less great

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,919
she finds a lot about how to package

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,120
your software a lot of toxicity

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:24,159
a lot of options of course um why can't

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:27,200
you just compile a linux binary

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,240
yeah no okay maybe she can get it into

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,840
the kernel

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,760
no that's silly as well we've all heard

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,559
linuses talk about that by now

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,840
so we run into a hurdle right we want to

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,760
build this thing for linux

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,320
because obviously and we want to build

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,320
it for r for the reasons we've discussed

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,440
but of course there's more than on is a

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:48,799
bonus but arm is what we want

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,240
so she starts to flounder handcuffed or

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,880
restrained by choice

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,360
what does she choose rpm flat pack app

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,640
image

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,320
snap dab blah blah blah blah

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,159
she reads up she finds some pretty good

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,440
documentation for each format

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,600
communities who are definitely

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,360
passionate about what they're doing

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,799
but the days start ticking by she

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,480
doesn't want to pick one

00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,919
and then regret it which is an app

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,200
developer right not the software

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,520
packager

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,880
it looks like uh this is another call to

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,760
action for me to

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,440
everyone this in the future or live

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,640
because i want to be

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,400
right on the nose with this one i'll

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,200
just sort of say it we have a lot of

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,720
baggage

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:29,280
in the linux app ecosystem everyone's uh

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,799
talks over the past few days been that

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,520
i've seen at least have been really

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,039
interesting

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,880
in improving the experience of learning

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,000
how to do things better or more

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,400
efficiently

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,679
but not a lot to address the that i've

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:44,000
seen a lot to address the baggage

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,520
when it comes to packaging now of course

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,120
this presentation is going to go in a

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,799
certain packaging direction

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,559
and i'm not here to start fights what we

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,120
need is the sort of objective

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,840
measurement

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,360
of what packaging is best for use cases

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,480
and then work on that sort of wider

00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,919
support

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:03,679
okay i touch on this again uh later but

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:05,600
if representatives of packaging formats

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,279
uh the abundant community team then i am

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,240
a part of would love to sort of

00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,640
join the discussion anyway right she is

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,279
in

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,400
this whole this packaging hall right

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:18,080
enter plot twist

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,880
number two hopefully enter one of

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,679
you folks she drops her concern in a

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,520
forum

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,600
it doesn't matter where she just drops

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,799
it in the form and lo and behold a

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,200
trusted advisor

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:31,279
a community leader maybe one of you good

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,640
folks responds

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,640
with something like this

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,520
very the options can be good and they're

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,799
all good for

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,799
reasons just remember

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,279
it's a it's the app that matters and

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,720
thanks for writing it for linux

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,640
so what are your goals what's your use

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,360
case and we'll see what packaging is

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,360
right for you

00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:01,279
link blink thank you anonymous community

00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,360
leader and

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,720
so she wants this to work on linux but

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,679
most importantly she wants it to work on

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,679
art

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,279
so the packaging has to have arm support

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,200
she wants it to become a thing and keep

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,880
developing so she wants to have easy way

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,640
to update it and of course

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,640
security is important too it is

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,080
uh so this community leader is going to

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,880
recommend to her

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,799
snaps because again of course they are

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,039
but let me reiterate the packaging isn't

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,120
is less important than the app here

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,799
plus my friend and colleague igor they

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,919
have a nice talk about snaps earlier in

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:35,360
the event

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:37,760
yesterday afternoon afternoon for me

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,720
so you'll all know all about them by now

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,960
and they're pretty cool and they're a

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:44,559
nice fit for this u-case

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,840
so she gets into the docs here we go

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,840
there is a lot of documentation around

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,720
snapping an app snapping a flutter app

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,400
specifically

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,679
and some nice articles written by some

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,760
first timers that one's by me

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,279
she learns that snapping an app for arm

00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,760
is not only possible

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,520
but is already being done all over the

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,320
snap ecosystem

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,520
uh quick uh digression again here just

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,440
in case you don't know

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,600
snaps are application containers that

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,840
bundle libraries and dependencies

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,679
inside themselves you can integrate

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,320
packaging snaps with your ci cd

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,520
pipelines

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,039
you can take advantage of the stack

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,159
craft extension for specific kinds of

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,320
middleware

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,480
um i knew i know i actually know a

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,720
couple of folks who build

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,600
ros robotic operating system snaps for

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,159
their robots

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,720
um and once the application is snapped

00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,279
it can be

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,960
available on the snap store uh to run on

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,640
any links distribution that runs that

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,000
systemd

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,279
and so that it can be kept up to date

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,240
and maintained and promoted and so on

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,039
okay next she would have to write her

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,200
yaml

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,880
this is effectively the snap itself it's

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,159
where all the plugs and interfaces get

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,600
added

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,240
and where you can make the app strictly

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,360
confined this comes from the early days

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,919
when snaps were built

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,679
and designed for iot devices and to run

00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,480
our embedded architectures like

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,400
like a phone this strict confinement is

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,760
what gives snaps their sort of container

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,120
nature so where

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:09,279
lxc or something of that elk could be

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,200
seen as a sort of machine container

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,720
a docker container could be seen as a

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,159
sort of process container

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,840
a snap can be seen as sort of an

00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,200
application container right the package

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,720
code and dependencies

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:23,200
like i mentioned before um into and sort

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:26,480
of isolated and immutable

00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,240
uh as

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,919
that's so the isolated and immutable

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,880
with a writable area separated from the

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,200
rest of the system

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,000
but visible to the host and now i'm not

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,760
going to go

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,240
and keep giving the spiel and selling

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,200
snaps but you can be sure they're

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,440
they're a good choice for our

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,399
applications uh especially

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,279
one like stonker so she makes a song

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,760
strictly confined

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,799
because why not she gets his security is

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,080
important

00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,360
i know i've heard it from lots of folks

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,870
and yes security is important she

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,200
guessed right

00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:55,760
[Music]

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,279
and we move on to the next line uh and

00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,360
so and then she builds it remotely

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,480
so this is a snapcraft feature that

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,000
actually builds on someone else's

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,840
computer it's a super nifty

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,120
and easy way if you want to actually do

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,640
things with your computer

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,559
while things build and it doesn't take

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,559
up all your resources

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,320
everything's built on launchpad so you

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,360
can drain that canonical infrastructure

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,919
instead of your own

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,840
um there's sometimes a cube but rarely

00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,480
uh does it take that long

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,840
take that long anyway uh okay so let's

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,480
say her build works

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,640
it's good it spits out numerous images

00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,200
including an amd 64 image

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,720
and nom image she tries it on her laptop

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,440
she tries the mdc for image on her

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,440
laptop

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,880
okay that one works but that's not what

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,120
she cares about right

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,720
what she cares about is the art

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,320
architecture

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:45,360
as we have discussed um

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,960
so she fires up ubuntu on her raspberry

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,200
pi 400 as you can see

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,960
on the slide here okay it works there

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,559
too she installs it

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,640
runs she tests it it's good not just

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,600
the 400 of course ubuntu server is

00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,080
certified

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,840
to work uh on all the raspberry pi's

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:05,120
with a higher version number than two

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:08,399
and a bluetooth desktop desktop works um

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,840
grand on pi fours by four hundreds and

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,520
naturally the desktop means the four

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,640
gigabyte model minimum

00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,399
but it but it works uh little

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,720
sort of side note there because i worked

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:22,159
on that stuff um

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:26,320
uh where was i

00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:28,399
uh okay so we've so she can get herself

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,320
on this accessible um hardware recipe

00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,919
price reciprocal 400's whatever it is

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,760
and she's confident uh because there's

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,799
two communities around it ubuntu and

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,559
raspberry pi

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,399
that will work and she'll be should be

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,480
able to test these things

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,600
uh if they're not developed natively

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,960
because she'd be able to

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,039
do the remote build system which will

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,840
build alarm or she could test natively

00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,440
so she kicks the tires she makes sure

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,880
that everything she wants the app to do

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,960
works

00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,559
good maybe she gets in touch with uh

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,080
with me or one of my colleagues to talk

00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,240
about testing we've run

00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,679
testing days and recent history of uh

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,200
for the abu dhabi images themselves

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,159
there's no reason she couldn't if she

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,399
wanted to

00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,640
start map testers thread herself or

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,320
group and crack on with some sweet sweet

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,120
application testing

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,760
and she goes she goes to the snap store

00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,840
and she reserves the name stonker

00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,520
starting to regret the name and she

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,279
builds for every architecture

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,919
she sends them to the global snap store

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,880
next slide uh she hooks it up to her get

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,760
her repo

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,000
with a few clickety clacks uh such that

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,880
every time she pushes to her github repo

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,159
it it triggers a new build that is

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,840
pushed to the store

00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,159
that could be straight to her stonker

00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,919
users or to another channel for personal

00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,720
testing or her community testing that

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,919
she's now

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:48,000
set up and she is going with

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:49,520
good sai so she sits back

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,799
but then she sits back up again right

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,600
because of what i was talking about

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,520
before

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,520
she makes her snap landing page look

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,240
nice she writes a blog post about her

00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,240
experience

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,000
she links to the snap landing page and

00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,200
the documentation that she found and the

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,760
sites that she found and

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,840
it really starts to build this starts to

00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,679
build this this

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,600
hyperlink trail not a paper trailer

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,399
hyperlink drill

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,960
um then because again she wants to do

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,120
this

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,320
properly she pops into the snapcraft

00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,760
forum about

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,320
uh about and she talks about what she's

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,200
done i see it me

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,880
reese i put it up there on the features

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,840
snap section on the snap store

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,600
because it's a pretty damn cool app and

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,679
it goes up a few hundred users maybe a

00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,559
few thousand users

00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,840
and how hold the phone she thinks to

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:39,440
herself

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,399
is that it right let's check let's check

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,120
let's check

00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,559
she has your app it's open source it's

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,799
hosted on github

00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,720
nice there are a couple of contributors

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,720
because along the way

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,840
uh she found people in the forum but she

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,080
can always call

00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,120
for more contributions and she's in the

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,960
right forms now

00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,399
it's just a matter of hopefully it's

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,559
just a matter of putting out the uh

00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:02,240
putting the word out there

00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,080
her github repo is hooked up to

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,640
snapcraft so we can keep

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,399
so she can keep her app up to date uh

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,600
she can trigger builds for all of the

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,000
architectures

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,679
that that's relevant to her and each

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,600
time we can do

00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,799
each time we do we can install the snap

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,679
on our raspberry pi

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,960
keep the tires test it works order the

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,559
whole process

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,880
from the beginning on a raspberry pi in

00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:28,000
the first place anyway

00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,480
huh did she just arm herself with a

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,399
linux app

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,159
and did she just contribute an app to

00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,919
the linux ecosystem

00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,159
that is going to be able to run on the

00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,080
nvidia r developer hardware of the

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,919
future

00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:46,000
i think she did now if you go through

00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,760
uh this whole process of building your

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,840
app already

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,880
and it already exists uh you really

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,200
didn't need to listen

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,320
to most of my presentation but if you

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,360
have similar goals

00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,919
to our protagonist update ability

00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,080
cost district support arm support for

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,919
the new world on the horizon

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,600
uh you you could you should check out

00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:09,600
snaps too

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:12,799
give yourself a hand and an arm

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,320
on support for uh applications i think

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,120
is going to be crucial for reaching out

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,200
to users

00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,080
both but not just uh crucial for getting

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,200
new users

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:26,240
but it could be an opportunity for linux

00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,840
the linux ecosystem in general right

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,760
um naturally there was a lot of

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,360
snaps in this presentation and while

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,559
snaps have a lot of benefits and pros

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,000
especially when building for arm

00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,880
architectures

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,559
especially for security and updatability

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,840
of course there are there are other ways

00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,919
we've heard lots about

00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,960
flat pack heard lots about um we've

00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,080
heard lots about a lot

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,120
this these past few days so again

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:56,399
and think back to the trusted advisor

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:58,399
you need attention who appears to talk

00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,720
a powerful quote that i just coupled

00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,720
together

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:07,840
figuring out with the

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:21,119
uh here were three things despite

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,560
it like this and the work everyone at

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,440
this conference does

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,760
apps on the next i'm sure everyone knows

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,040
the

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,040
lacking ability next time

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,200
or a blog tutorial or even do a video

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:40,480
about app development

00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,480
a moment to think about

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:49,839
application to find your content

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,280
to beat the algorithm or or get the seo

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,119
in there like i mentioned earlier

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,040
but it means signposting where to get

00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,760
started right how can we

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,119
expect people to join our linux

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:18,079
community highway

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,079
if they can't find the and

00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,320
next packages software packaging

00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,599
brings with it a lot of questions and

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,280
now i don't

00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:31,280
to poo poo

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,560
packaging i like that like i've said the

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,599
technologies

00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,440
i spent all of about a month uh at

00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,400
canonical as a snap advocate

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,160
before i was moved to the community this

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,720
was not

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,240
an internal thing uh in that time i

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,359
snapped some things i wrote about

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,880
snapping i learned

00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:51,040
about the notifications and i learned

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,160
about packaging now as i say the

00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,960
technology is great

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,000
really interesting and super useful but

00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,040
the drama

00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,320
is uh less so there are some wonderful

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,760
people in the community who are

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,400
incredibly constructive

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,280
and helpful and who get it and i've

00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,760
virtually

00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,160
messaged numbers of them here at this

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,520
conference and it's been great

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,359
and there are people who talk about

00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,920
packaging software like it's an

00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:18,079
extremist branch of a religion

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,560
now far be it from me to wade into those

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,480
waters any more than i already have

00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,480
but for the sake of the linux app

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,240
ecosystem i think we need to find a

00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,200
better way to deal with

00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,680
these issues if you have ideas let me

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,960
know

00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:35,599
maybe we can start a movement

00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,359
and third and finally we have i think we

00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,280
have a unique opportunity

00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:41,040
with the coming of more linux compatible

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,440
mainstream

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,160
arm hardware to solve both of these

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,680
issues

00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,760
and get ahead of the game as a brit

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,440
i've been following the acquisition of

00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,920
arm with a keen eye

00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:57,280
the pros and cons are of course enormous

00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,359
and one way or the other there's going

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,200
to be a lasting impact on arm and the

00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,400
general hardware landscape that's out

00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,480
there

00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:08,720
if it goes ahead in theory possibly

00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,400
just possibly there is a huge

00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,440
opportunity

00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,440
uh to regroup and the kicks to kick

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,119
linux apps into a new gear

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,040
there's a lot of possibility but if we

00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,280
if we use this opportunity to get some

00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,040
semblance of coherency give linux

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,800
applications common ground

00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,280
get them out there ahead of the pack

00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,320
people new developers all developers

00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,119
might take notice

00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,599
hey i know folks at nvidia renault will

00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,920
see this

00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:36,480
they take notice themselves but it's up

00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,520
to linux app developers folks like you

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,599
guys

00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:45,200
and girls apologies you folks you people

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:48,480
people watching um to make it happen

00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:51,760
again if you have any ideas um

00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:54,160
i'd like to hear them we can uh start a

00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,160
movement

00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,920
yeah so hold on hold on carlos let me

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,119
can i

00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,200

00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:11,200
shared notes in a second when i open it

let me know if you want to talk about

00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,720
the ubuntu community or have a project

00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,200
idea that i might be able to help you

00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,800
with

00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,400
or you want to shout at me for being an

00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,480
idiot and you don't like this talk

00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,440
uh these are the places on screen you

00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,800
can find me

00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,000
come and say hello and i'll shout out

00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,240
now to keep an eye on that

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,119
twitter address on screen and the ubuntu

00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,560
discourse

00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,720
uh because we have some interesting

00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,960
things going in the ubuntu community

00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,079
and just before i get to the shared

00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,079
notes as well

00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,839
i'd like to use this last slot to thank

00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,160
all of the organizers

00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:49,920
of the linux app summit on behalf of

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,960
myself and also on behalf of

00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,960
uh canonical for doing such a tremendous

00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,280
job and keeping on top of everything

00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,880
i've been looking in the organizers

00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,520
telegram channel throughout the whole

00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,040
thing

00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,880
and everything has been handled quickly

00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,480
and well to keep everything moving

00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:09,200
so like um like karen sandler said

00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,400
on the day one i'd like to give i'd like

00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,440
i hope everyone can give

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,839
a silent applause for such a good uh

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,839
event

00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,480
to the shared notes yeah that's it thank

00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,800
you

00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,400
no problem uh what apps do you think are

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,440
ideal for new beginning developers to

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,040
convert

00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,880
or create either existing apps or

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,839
general classes of apps

00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,480
um so since we're at the linux app

00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,560
summit i'll

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,839
i'll stick to desktop applications but

00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,400
the the

00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:42,400
the best ones are the simplest ones i

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:46,079
think for getting started the first

00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,079
um application uh so

00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,520
i've i wanted to get into application

00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:51,680
development a long time ago and i found

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,760
sort of no code tools and things to

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,880
to get things going before i before i

00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,240
found the the kool-aid um

00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,079
and the best things i think to start

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,720
with are the really really simple things

00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,160
that you can make um that are maybe that

00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,920
would may be fragmented that you don't

00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,800
expect to make lots of noise or make

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,560
lots of noise about

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,480
something like stonker that you know you

00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,839
would use even if it's not the best

00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,560
thing ever because it doesn't really

00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,400
matter

00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,400
so maybe something like a note-taking

00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,880
app or a very very simple note-taking

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:22,240
app or a very very simple

00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,920
very simple timer you know something

00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,240
something that you can do natively and

00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,480
you can you can get your wheels turning

00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,760
something you could use even if no one

00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,640
else would use it just because you

00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,880
believe it

00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,000
you know and then write about it then

00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,000
talk about how you

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,119
experienced how you how what the

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,440
experience was like for you and then

00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,920
tell

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,670
me about it and socialize it and have a

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,920
great time

00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:45,119
[Music]

00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,079
um two so in reality the new we've been

00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,520
to installer that you guys that

00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,720
canonical are writing in flutter

00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,200
and that's going to be released in the

00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,760
future it's going to work on the baked

00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,520
raspberry pie have you considered that

00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,280
um

00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,560
we have we have and we are considering

00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,839
that still

00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,119
um like you say in reality the new

00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,480
ubuntu installer

00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,440
that those guys are writing and flooded

00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,160
that's going to be released in the

00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,160
future

00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,319
it's going to work going to work we're

00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,760
going to make sure that it works

00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:13,359
i hope i haven't dropped the desktop

00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,800
team in it but that is

00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:18,160
i think fair to say three where can i

00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,400
find other people who are packaging

00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,200
snaps who could help me debug snaps that

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,720
i'm packaging

00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:27,839
well let me let me tell you

00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:34,319
here let me paste this in this

00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:37,119
is a snapcraft oh dear that's not right

00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:39,280
dot snapcraft.io is the snapcraft forum

00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,359
where you can sign up and join in and

00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,640
uh and have all the fun there are people

00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,400
from canonical

00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,920
uh who are very very regularly in there

00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,839
including myself but there are also a

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,800
lot of community contributors and

00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:51,200
snap people who are happy to help debug

00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,079
and

00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,599
talk about snap packaging and i'm

00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,319
frankly a lot of folks in there i've

00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,599
seen

00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,359
talk about snap packaging and then if

00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,359
you come with your application and they

00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,720
see that maybe snap isn't the best fit

00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:04,480
we can point you to in the right

00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,520
direction as well

00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,040
but um to address the first of my sort

00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,400
of calls to action here

00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,760
i would encourage you to to try and do

00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,680
the app talk about your experience

00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,280
try and look for packaging talk about

00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,319
your experience write about it blog

00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,960
about it

00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:23,440
and let us know because we'd uh we'd

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,440
like to hear

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,319
cool i think that's all of the questions

00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,400
is that the end of my uh closing keynote

00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,440
thank you

00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:38,880
