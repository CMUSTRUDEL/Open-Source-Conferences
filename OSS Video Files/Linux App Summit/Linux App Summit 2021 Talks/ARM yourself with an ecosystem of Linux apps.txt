Title: ARM yourself with an ecosystem of Linux apps
Publication date: 2021-05-30
Playlist: Linux App Summit 2021 Talks
Description: 
	Soon the likes of Apple’s M1 chip won’t cost an ARM and a leg. In the not too distant future adding ARM support to your applications is going to be crucial for reaching users, both old and new.

ARM hardware is cropping up in more and more places, it’s not just for embedded devices anymore. ARM clouds have been around for a while and we’re seeing the first serious workstations from Apple. Before NVIDIA brings ARM into every developer's life, let me tell you Ubuntu’s plan for support and how you can start testing and developing for ARM, using the software and the workflows you’re used to, today.

    2. So in reality the new Ubuntu installer that you guys at Canonical are writting in Flutter and thats gonna be released in the future is gonna work on the baked raspberry pie
have you considered that?
    
    3. Where can I find other people who are packaging Snaps, who could help me debug Snaps that I'm packaging?
