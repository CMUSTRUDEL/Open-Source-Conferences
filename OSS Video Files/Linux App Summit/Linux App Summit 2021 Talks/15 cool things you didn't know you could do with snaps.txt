Q&A


1. Do parallel instalations isolate instance app configurations?

2. Will it be possible to configure refreshing from the store GUI, or the updates app, or the repositories, to make it more friendly for newbies?

3. Can we force snapshots on any snap?

4. Does Debian also have such system/feature? The Snapshots. Yes, ty

5. what will happen if different users install the same snap? will different snaps will be installed? 

6. Can you use the "home" interface to give each snap its own home directory, mapping to an arbitrary location in the filesystem?

7. what containerization tools are used in SNAP (ex. bubblewrap in flatpak)

8. What's the status of snap support across distros?

9. Aww, nobody uses Fedora on the team anymore? :'(

10. Other distribution bases for snaps possible?
freedesktop-sdk has been working with snap team to make this possible but we are not there yet, I think this is the thread; https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/base-runtime-freedesktop-sdk-runtime-19-08/11153

11. what's your favourite experimental feature?

12. Do you know if there's some chance of Fedora Silverblue supporting snaps? (Classic snaps use /snap, which is forbidden by RPM-OSTree, regular confined snaps work fine)

13. how can we make sure developers update dependencies for security?
