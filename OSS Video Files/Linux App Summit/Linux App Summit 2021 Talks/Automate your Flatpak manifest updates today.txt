Title: Automate your Flatpak manifest updates today
Publication date: 2021-05-30
Playlist: Linux App Summit 2021 Talks
Description: 
	flatpak-external-data-checker started life as a side-project at Endless, notifying the team when a small number of unofficial Flatpak wrappers for third-party proprietary apps in Endless' own Flatpak repository needed attention. Three years and sixteen developers later, it checks and automatically updates over a hundred apps on Flathub, many of which are free software and maintained by their upstream developers, and has a small but thriving community of contributors itself.

This talk will cover how this tool grew into its present form, how it can help you maintain a Flatpak of your application, and its implications for the health of the Flathub ecosystem.

Q&A


1. Can this tool be used to automatically update the runtime to use, so we avoid apps using deprecated GNOME, KDE, freedesktop-sdk, etc runtimes?

2. Can we use this tool to automate update GNOME/KDE tarball in manifest?
