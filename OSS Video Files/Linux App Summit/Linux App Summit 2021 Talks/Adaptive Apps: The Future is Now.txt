Title: Adaptive Apps: The Future is Now
Publication date: 2021-05-30
Playlist: Linux App Summit 2021 Talks
Description: 
	Over the past few years we have laid the foundation for an ecosystem of GNOME apps that work seamlessly across form factors, from phones to desktops and everything inbetween. There are now dozens of core and third party apps using these new adaptive widgets and design patterns, and most new apps are adaptive from day one.

But that's just the beginning: GTK4 is finally out, and apps are starting to move to it. This transition unlocks a whole new world of gestures, animations, and layouts that were not possible before.

In this talk I'll sum up the current state of adaptive GNOME apps, demo some of the most exciting new stuff, and talk about what's in store for the future.

Q&A


1. How is the system handling different DPI scaling? For example 1080p 24" vs 6" 720p one? (Identifying how "big" the UI should be)

Not sure I'm the right person to answer this, or how this is different from regular desktop HiDPI, but basically it's up to the device to have a reasonable resolution such that integer scaling gives you useful UI elements. Both Librem 5 and Phinephone have such a resolution, so they just do 2x scaling.

2. Some people don't like CSD because it may seem too large for them and that they have limited control over decorations applied to CSD. Could DWD (Dynamic Window Decorations) that was brought to the table 5 years ago be the solution to make everyone happy if it would be worked on this time around? 

Not sure how this is relevant to the talk? Also not my expertise, sorry :)

3. This makes me want to distro-hoop tonight

okay um hello everybody

00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,680
uh i'm tobias uh i'm on the design team

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,880
and

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,480
yeah uh this talk is not gonna be

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,400
totally new to those of you who have

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,400
seen my previous squad talks

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,520
um i used to always give these talks

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,359
about like sort of

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,279
state of no mobile and like adaptive

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,080
apps and just generally the app

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,400
ecosystem

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,320
like developer tools and so on and this

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,720
is going to be like basically another

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,439
one

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,160
in in that series i didn't get one last

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,640
year because

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,239
there were no real conferences and i

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,840
think at the time the thinking was very

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,280
optimistic that like oh next year is

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,960
going to be conferences again we can you

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,520
know

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,800
do things in the future but that future

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,440
is not here yet

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,640
so um here we are this this is i guess

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,480
like the best

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,760
the best we can do at the moment it's a

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,199
little bit unfortunate because this

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,640
stock is gonna have a lot of demos

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,480
and some of them are gonna have like

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,079
animated things and

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,520
those are gonna look very bad probably

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,039
because the frame rate is

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:04,640
not it's not great through this so

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,080
um maybe i can like where i'm gonna put

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,280
the slides maybe i can put links to all

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,400
the demos so you can build them yourself

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,880
and try them

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,799
um but yeah that's kind of a handicap

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,600
here um

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,720
and i i i'll try to like do things a

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,159
whole bunch of times so that maybe you

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,040
can catch some of the frames in between

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,960
but

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,640
it's not gonna be a deal but yeah so

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,720
basically i'll i'll pick up from where i

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,000
left off in like 2019 when i last gave

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,560
this talk

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,840
and kind of like bring you up to speed

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,000
on where we are now

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,680
and talk a little bit about the future

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,880
um but yeah since it's been a while

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,360
uh there's quite a few high-level things

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,479
to

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,000
catch you up on um here at the beginning

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,840
uh the first of which is that there is

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
actual hardware now um there are like

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,759
real mainland limits phones

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,040
um you know not just like the leader

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,320
five but also the pine phone and there's

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,680
a whole bunch of them out there and

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,320
people are using them and developing in

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,399
them

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,360
it's cool right like this is something

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,600
that

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,399
we we did not have at any point in the

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,479
past

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,640
and it's it's a real step forward and i

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,520
think we can be really proud of that

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,640
um on the software side one really

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,560
interesting thing that happened like

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,160
basically since i last gave this talk

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,319
it said live handy and the kind of like

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,319
whole adaptive um

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,680
way of building apps went from this kind

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,720
of like cool thing that

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,560
that a few people were doing sort of

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,239
um and pointing parts of the ecosystem

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,360
to really like a core part of the gnome

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,440
ecosystem

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,599
uh world of handy is now kind of like

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,800
the de facto library where we put new

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,640
widgets um for gnome apps regardless of

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,360
like adaptiveness or whatever

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,879
um and along with that also i think like

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,519
the whole app ecosystem both

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,640
core and third party has really um

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,440
embraced the

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,879
this direction and uh yeah we're seeing

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,080
a lot of great progress in that in that

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,800
sense

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,680
um i think yeah over the last whatever

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,720
like

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,959
three years we've slowly been porting

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,879
a large portion of the core apps and

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,959
just like to talk about a few that

00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,920
made like significant progress recently

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,239
uh geary

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,599
like there was a fairly fairly

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,800
long-lived process process

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,640
it's finally at the point where um most

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,080
of the major things are adaptive like

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,840
there are still some

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,200
uh things to improve around the edges

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,800
but like so the base

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,480
layout where like you know it folds into

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,080
various columns and so on

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,000
um that is uh sort of upstream now and

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,599
yeah like all of the major pieces are

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,799
kind of in place um

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,280
there's there's gonna be more work

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,519
coming probably but uh

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,959
there always is right um another one for

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,360
example is calculator which

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,640
um just very recently adrian plaza's uh

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,440
did some really good work on and it's

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,280
now fully

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,640
adapted upstream including all the crazy

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,560
modes um

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,040
i can quickly show you that because it's

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,000
pretty cool so like if it's really large

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,239
or like this so

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,280
the larger sizes there's this max width

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,080
which is actually

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,959
it's something that we didn't really

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,720
have before i think uh before yeah

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,840
either it wasn't resizable or like it

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,720
just looked really bad i'm not really

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,080
sure but

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,840
anyway now it does something sensible

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,560
when you make it large then when it's

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,080
small like

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,480
so it does shrink to like fairly small

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,920
sizes uh even in like yeah the crazy

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,360
programming mode or whatever like this

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,799
this also works

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,799
and that's a really nice thing where

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,400
like it's it's full width and the narrow

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,280
width and so like

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,000
it changes the column width there um and

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,840
yeah i mean

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,519
it's it's just like another example of

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,040
like if you do things properly in a

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,239
stream like you

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,120
just there's some real benefits for

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,880
everyone um from that kind of thing

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,440
and yes mother is an example like mac's

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,080
got some really nice uh updates at 40.

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,720
thanks i think mostly james westman um

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,960
bilal

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,400
and uh chris like did a bunch of work on

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,120
stuff like characters and a whole bunch

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,600
of other

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,840
so the smaller like utility apps and

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,560
they're all like slowly moving towards

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,759
being adapted or are already there um

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,280
and yeah i think we've

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,880
really made a lot of good progress here

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,160
over the last few years and

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,639
i think we'll continue to do for the

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,560
next few cycles um

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,840
the third party apps as usual are a

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,520
little bit ahead

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,680
where like i think yeah basically for

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,479
the last two years or so like

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,400
almost every third party apps that would

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,840
make sense for it to to run on on like a

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,360
mobile form factor

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,479
has been adaptive um yeah these are just

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,800
like a few of the

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,479
nicer examples uh one that i want to

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,520
show you is this translation app

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,880
called a dialogue and

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,720
uh the cool thing here is that there's

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,560
like you have these two entries

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,560
like next to each other on a wider

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,080
screen then when you make it narrow it

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,680
just puts them above one another it's

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,160
just like a really natural nice

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,880
way of doing that um so yeah kudos to

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,120
the developers

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:36,160
this is a really well-known app um

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,560
so yeah um that that's kind of like the

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,720
current app ecosystem we have looking

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,360
hell a little bit like gtk4 is finally

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,919
out

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,440
and that's sort of a big generational

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,039
shift like we're not really seeing a ton

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,199
of the benefits of that yet because most

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,639
of our apps are not actually for it yet

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,320
but that's going to be ramping up like

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,520
the next few cycles and yeah i'm going

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,240
to talk a little bit more about that

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,360
later but

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,360
that's going to be really really cool um

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,800
zooming out a little bit from our like

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,680
specific

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,720
um contacts to like the wider industry

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,479
one of the things that's been really

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,360
interesting the last few years

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,759
is um how like the entire industry is

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,919
moving

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,600
in a similar direction to what what we

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,039
have been trying to do

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,280
where like basically you have a single

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,880
app codebase and ui

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,639
and you just adapt it to various form

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,639
factors um in

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,400
sort of like the the ways that are

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,759
necessary but like without completely

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,199
redoing the app and i think

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,560
particularly interesting is that apple

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,360
is also doing it now where like in the

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,120
past they were

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,120
kind of like the odd one out today when

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,080
i was like no the iphone is like a

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,199
special flower and

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,680
mac is completely you know its own thing

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,120
and like

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,680
you should make two completely separate

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,520
apps like with if you like look at last

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,520
year's wwc

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,800
um developer talks like there's a lot of

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,000
talk about like

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,520
um sort of these these various like

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,240
device form factors and then like with

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,599
mac catalyst you can board ipad apps to

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,560
through the mac like it's just sort of

00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:01,520
like an automatic part of your

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,880
uh of your development workflow and like

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,840
even on the design patterns out there

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,840
they're talking about like you have a

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,599
tab bar at the bottom like on the phone

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,120
he moves that same stuff to the sidebar

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,720
on the tablet and then the sidebar with

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,840
some small changes stays exactly the

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,520
same on the mac

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,680
and so it's it's really cool to see that

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,720
everyone is sort of like going in the

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,840
same direction and

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,599
you know i guess it validates um

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,360
it values what we're doing also from a

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,280
conceptual point of view

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,639
so yeah that's that's a little bit sort

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,479
of like the

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:34,400
the high level um high level updates

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:36,560
let's dive into widgets um so i think

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,160
when when i was last giving this talk we

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,840
were kind of at the point where

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,520
most of the important widgets that you

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,919
needed to like actually port apps like

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,759
to

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,960
sort of i don't know do navigation and

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,360
things like that

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,360
we kind of had um but we were working on

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,120
a lot of like sort of

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,240
nice uh nice uh sort of improvements on

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,479
on top of that like for example the

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,199
backswipe gestures and so on and all

00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,759
that stuff

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,120
is now merged and has been in actual use

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,680
for like over a year

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,800
so i think uh yeah none of that is like

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,000
particularly new

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,720
but i'm gonna go through them quickly

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,240
anyway just like to catch you up

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,560
yeah i think the first and most

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,280
important one of them those is like

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,400
the swipe gestures especially on uh back

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,000
at the glass

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,560
so here's an example in contacts where

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,039
um at the smaller sizes basically like

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,840
you can

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,360
click the back button or you can like on

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,400
a touch pad or a touch screen just like

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,479
sort of swipe

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,080
just acceleration and sort of just you

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,399
know like all of these little details

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,599
like

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,959
it dims the background um and just like

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,440
behaves the way you would expect it to

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,680
which

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,360
as as always is always surprisingly hard

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,839
right um but yeah

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,680
that just works now and yeah alexander

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,480
mikhail did a lot of really good work in

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,519
this

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,240
um and and yeah i think like probably

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,440
all of you are

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,080
already using some apps that do this

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:58,000
that's not like particularly new but

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,640
yeah sort of a sister widget to this one

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,600
is

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,200
the flat widget which is basically the

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,320
same thing except like not covering the

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,720
whole view

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,080
and this only landed fairly recently so

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,800
there's not like a lot of apps that

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,720
actually use

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:16,000
it use it yet but um so this is a

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,320
kind of like uh initial uh step towards

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,760
supporting events like making an adapter

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,920
that comes with this widget and then

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,600
yeah it's like this transient sidebar

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,240
it's not like a completely separate view

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,680
it's basically like an additional like

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,200
space to show some information

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,279
related to the view so in this case like

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,959
the sidebar with the pages

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,640
and you can like open it with the button

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,120
or swipe it like with the same kind of

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,480
like

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:42,080
gestures um as

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,839
as the lethal door or the deck um

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,200
another one that i don't think i need to

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,880
show you a special demo for because all

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,560
the apps here basically do it

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,920
is around the bottom corners so that's

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,519
something that we wanted for a really

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,240
long time

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,839
and the that for for technical reasons

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,680
that was difficult because like

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,120
we could run things but we couldn't like

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,560
really have that also clip

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,800
the the background or like the the

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,839
the children like inside a container and

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,760
so essentially

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,880
uh you could end up with glitches where

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,160
like in some cases it's wrong

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,000
in our case there's like stuff kind of

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,399
sticking out so we couldn't really do

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,600
that

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,279
um thanks to alexander's work on hy

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,800
window that is finally possible

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,399
along with a lot of really cool things

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,240
but yeah it's just like one of those

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,200
things where

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,720
you you you sort of like think about it

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,640
and plan for it for years and years and

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,959
then eventually it finally happens and

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:35,040
it's just really cool to see that um

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,040
yeah speaking of cool things alexander

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,079
did the tabs widget is another

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,480
really um really really cool thing that

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,279
we got

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,959
in recently where basically like

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,480
historically we have gtk notebook

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,399
which you can kind of use to make apps

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,920
widgets but like it only does a fairly

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,200
small amount of the stuff that you would

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,480
want like from a proper

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,640
like web browser tab system um

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,000
and so there was a lot of inconsistency

00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,440
between different apps because like they

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,720
had to influence stuff like pinning or

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,120
whatever like

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,640
by themselves and like the key bindings

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,240
and like all sorts of stuff

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,079
but with these new tabs it basically has

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,920
everything that you expect from some

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:13,279
proper browser level tabs you can

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,959
reorder them with animations then you

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,480
can scroll

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,279
like before they were like these these

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,680
cheap arrows it was pretty pretty lame

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,720
um and yeah you can like move stuff

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,720
between windows

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,720
and like it all works in in the way you

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,000
would expect and it's just you know

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,519
there's like hundreds and hundreds of

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,079
little details and but if they're in

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,040
place like

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,839
it just like feels so so much better um

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,040
so yeah that's

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,160
that's currently in in web only as far

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,480
as i know

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,760
um but it's going like in the medium

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,079
term it's coming to all the apps that we

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,880
have

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,279
the test tabs so like novels and so on

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,839
so

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,279
yeah that's gonna be really cool i think

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,320
um another one is

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,959
avatars um so historically we had a

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,959
whole bunch of

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,880
widgets implementing some kind of like

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,600
standard avatar

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,480
um or something like fallback default

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,440
avatar

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,800
um thing where like if there's no avatar

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,160
picture like it will generate one from

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,079
the name and so on and there's like a

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,600
lot of edge cases with this because like

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,440
um sometimes you have a first name

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,639
sometimes you have a last uh

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,639
last name sometimes you have a whole

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,240
bunch of names depending on the size of

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,920
the characters like you need to scale it

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,360
differently like there are different

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,560
sizes of which you want to use them so

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,760
um yeah we had a bunch of

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,720
implementations that all had kind of

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,079
like different issues

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,480
those was winning fractal and one

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,880
contact the thing good one

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,079
uh well there's the one that's still

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,440
used in the shell that we're hopefully

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,519
going to get rid of soon

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,040
um but yeah look so now there's like a

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,120
new one in the handy that actually

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,800
covers all the edge cases and that looks

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,760
nice and like does all the things you

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,040
would want

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,240
uh including like for example um if you

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,320
look at this one and this one

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,399
they're not actually the same exact

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,800
image like the letters here are smaller

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,079
than

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,519
on here so that's like they're more

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,760
visible to smaller sizes but they don't

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,200
get huge on the large sizes so

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,120
there's all these little details that

00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,839
that you that you really want to get

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,760
right

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,440
um and i think i think we're pretty

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,079
happy with what we have now

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,959
um so yeah thanks julian and everyone

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,880
else who

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,560
worked on making this happen and i guess

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,079
like over the next few cycles we're

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,079
hopefully gonna get to the point where

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,360
we just use them everywhere um

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,920
i think like yeah right now they're in

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,320
contact uh in geary

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,399
in calls and a few other things but yeah

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,399
i think we're getting there

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,160
um another one that's also not like

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,440
super new is the carousel

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,120
which yeah i think i already had a

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,639
working version of that like that my

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,600
last talk but not as an actual app to

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,800
show you so

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,920
maybe that's a bit uh nicer so yeah it's

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,360
basically just like a paginated

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,160
scrolling widget it can be vertical or

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,240
horizontal

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,920
but like yeah you we usually use it for

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,920
these kind of like slideshow

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,760
um things and yeah you got all the same

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,199
like nice acceleration gestures

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:52,079
as um as with

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,959
stuff like back gestures uh yeah that's

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,800
just like sort of a

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,720
cool primitive to have for a whole bunch

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,079
of places

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,320
uh this is one that i personally really

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:04,240
love it's like a really small detail but

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:07,839
it's just really delightful um so

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,519
if you sometimes you have lists where um

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,440
you you want sort of like various things

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,120
to be grouped but then you also want

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,240
them to expand but then when you expand

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
them and they're still like grouped in

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,199
the list it looks

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,199
a bit weird and so what we have here is

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:22,320
the ability to basically like split out

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,760
things dynamically from the list um so

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,120
that

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,959
yeah essentially like they become their

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,800
own kind of like semantic unit

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,639
and yeah it's just like one of those

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,079
really nice details

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,920
uh that i personally really love and

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,120
that's yeah i i wish we would

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,920
do more of this kind of stuff because

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,760
it's just like it really elevates things

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,120
uh when you have these nice little

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,959
touches

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,320
um so yeah i don't want to talk too much

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,760
about all the stuff because i think

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,600
yeah you've all been using it for a

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,519
while so it's

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,720
it's nothing like too new a few more

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,360
things to shut up

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,880
um like generally the hdmi window thing

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,440
makes header bars a lot more flexible so

00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,040
you can

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,040
do like stuff like header bars above the

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,079
content or like um have them be

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,519
transparent or like

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,880
slide out sometimes or whatever like the

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,120
whole separation between header bar and

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,720
content is now essentially gone

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,560
uh so that allows for a whole bunch of

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,160
cool stuff uh

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,399
the column which is basically like to

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,120
have a max width on things

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,560
uh can also be used vertically um so

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,680
just like also for max heights or

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,600
something

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,120
um and so it will bring him to clamp

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,519
because otherwise it wouldn't make sense

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,480
there's not a status page widget which

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,920
is sort of like for

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,199
if you want an icon and some text below

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,320
it or whatever for empty states and to

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,800
like

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,160
and there's also uh like apps can now in

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,639
their desktop file like

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,279
sort of tell the operating system that

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,440
they're

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,199
optimized for mobile so that's helpful

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,600
for for example like filtering things

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,880
out

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,279
um on on mobile distributions

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,440
um so yeah that's some of the uh the

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,680
stuff that

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,560
that i guess we got done over the last

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,160
few years

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,759
but now let's talk about future stuff

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,279
because i think that's always where

00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,199
the excitement uh really comes in

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,120
tonight um

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,680
so one of the things that we've wanted

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,360
for a really long time

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,040
and i think that was sort of like a

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,079
missing part of our developer story

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,399
for yeah since forever basically

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,079
is a proper widget library that actually

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,959
like aligns our platform

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,639
um because i think historically the

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,160
strategy was always to like move shared

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,680
widgets into gdk

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,360
but then there were always issues with

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,560
like the the release cycles kind of like

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,480
being misaligned and

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,399
often we were like kind of frustrated

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,360
that like our ux goals could not really

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,720
be met for like

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,519
obscure gdk reasons um

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,120
and so going forward we we really want

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,800
to have a widget library that is

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,040
actually like synchronized with our

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,720
design um that is specific to our

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,880
platform and that doesn't like need to

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,560
have all these extra considerations

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,240
um that are not really relevant for

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,079
gnome um

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,759
and yeah i mean basically like for the

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,360
last few years i already alluded to this

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,240
uh the candy has kind of become this for

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,600
gtk3

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,519
but like initially it was just a bunch

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,959
of adaptive widgets but then like since

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,320
it was the place where where everything

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,160
was going like people also started

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,600
adding more generic widgets to

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,439
uh but like the list rows and the

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,000
avatars and stuff like that

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,839
and so yeah i think it is the factor

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,760
that now and we just made it official

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,039
but for gdk4 we would like something

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,880
slightly sort of

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,559
more like cleaner in terms of branding

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,079
and messaging

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,839
so we're introducing a new library

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,520
called libadvita

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,959
which is named after like the rest of

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,880
our visual language like

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,480
the icons in the style sheet use that

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,200
name so it kind of made sense to

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,039
to use it here as well and basically

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,840
initially it's going to be a gtk

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,720
or like it already is a gtk4 port of the

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,320
handy

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,919
uh plus minus a few things that got

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,200
upstream or whatever

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,720
um and yeah essentially

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,400
like going forward this is going to be

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,799
the new place where all

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,760
the like no specific widgets go and it's

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,559
going to be the place that app

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,080
developers can

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,000
can look at as like the canonical

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,280
implementation of all the

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,840
uh like four patterns and in

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,960
in addition to that um one thing that's

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,160
also currently in the works

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,240
it's a new version of the human

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,240
interface guidelines um

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,919
which sort of like it all ties in

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,760
together in the sense that like

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,600
historically one of the issues with the

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,200
hitting was that we were documenting

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,600
patterns that we didn't like have

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,440
a single economical implementation for

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,039
so like we would describe the thing but

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,360
then you would have to build it yourself

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,360
like

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,799
based on basically that description and

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,320
like there were all sorts of copy pasted

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,799
implementations in various apps or

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,320
still are in some cases and so going

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,760
forward what we want is like

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,880
for the human interface guidelines to

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,080
actually be synchronized with

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,640
libertarian

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,240
um so like you read about a design

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,520
pattern like in the higgs

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,640
and then you can just go use it uh like

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,880
you know there's a link there to the

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,080
widget for how to do it and i think

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,120
that's going to be a major

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:48,720
um step forward for our developer story

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,160
um as you know as always

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,400
like that you can never have enough

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,559
widgets um

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,559
i think we are at the point now where

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,400
like yeah uh

00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,679
there's not that many things missing

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,960
quote unquote

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:05,360
um to to like build like

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,000
really nice adaptive apps but you know

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,120
there's always

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,559
additional things where you can make

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,200
things easier for developers and i don't

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,799
really see that

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,760
changing anytime soon um one thing that

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,919
we've talked about

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,360
recently was sort of like having a

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,679
built-in version of like

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,840
uh sort of the adaptive side of a tabs

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,520
widget so like we have new tabs but

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,760
they are like basically desktop only

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,120
and ideally we would like as part of

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,400
that to have sort of like mobile

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,960
components as well where like

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,640
you have your text editor or whatever um

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,480
that like has tabs on the desktop

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,559
but then if you want it to run on a

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,880
mobile form factor like it would be cool

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,640
to

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,520
if the tabs just like work there as well

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,320
and you don't have to do something

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,000
custom

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,520
like efficiently has a custom tabs

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,080
implementation that

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,360
sort of does essentially this um but it

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,799
would be cooler if

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,360
app developers didn't have to do a whole

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:56,480
bunch of work um to get that

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,880
so i have a demo here let's see

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,160
i have a demo here that alexander made

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,840
um

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,120
this is kind of like so on desktop you

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,799
just like have basically these these

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,240
regular tabs you can do all the regular

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,440
tab things

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,679
and then if you like reset it to a

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,320
smaller size you get this hammer here at

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,840
the bottom

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:16,480
where you can like add and remove tabs

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,679
switch between them and so on um like

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,679
this design is

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,120
like not 100 set in stone but i think

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,600
something is direction is probably what

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,360
we're

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,200
going to go with for gtk3 for gtk4

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,640
it's it's an open question like we might

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,840
do something fancy or not

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,360
like depending on various other factors

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,960
um but yeah this is something that we

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,520
would really like to have

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,799
um then there's a bunch of things that

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,520
are more like on the wish list

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,320
um but that that i wanna talk about like

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,000
just sort of

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,600
to give you a more general idea of like

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,840
the kinds of things that we're thinking

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,000
about

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:52,400
um so one

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,080
problem with so in the last year we've

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,880
generally moved most layouts to list

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,159
boxes

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,760
this is just like a cleaner more

00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,120
flexible pattern than the old kind like

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,400
form layout

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,720
um but one of the problems with that is

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
that

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,000
entries don't really work that well in

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,360
that so they don't really mix that well

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,840
with list rows

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,520
and so it would be cool to have list

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,240
rows that are like optimized for that

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,640
kind of work

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,480
uh for that kind of um layout and

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,080
so we have designed for a new listro

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,000
entry widget that will basically

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,000
look a little bit like this in context

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,440
where you have a list row that is

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,720
actually the entry as opposed to like

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,480
having sort of like a box and then

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,480
another box inside the box and

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,159
the the label kind of like taking up

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,360
after with so you can only have really

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,799
narrow ones and

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,720
it will solve a whole bunch of issues

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,760
with that it's not like a deal breaker

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,640
for anything but it would be cool to

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,240
have

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,720
uh so yeah if anyone's interested in

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,880
helping with that by the way uh

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,919
contact us but yeah i mean it's one of

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,840
the things that probably

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,159
we're gonna look at medium term once all

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,679
the liquid weather stuff um

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:56,960
lands and so on um another

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,799
one in a similar vein is the whole

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,320
instax dialogue kind of situation where

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,840
like on desktop

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,919
you want dialog to be a separate window

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,640
that's just like overlaid right

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,080
um but on mobile that doesn't always

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,080
make sense because

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,240
like you know if if your window sort of

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,120
needs to take up the whole screen anyway

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,480
um you like structurally it would make

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,679
more sense if it was just like a panel

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,200
that you can swipe away

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,039
right so it's basically an in-stack view

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,960
instead of a separate window

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,400
um and technically that's kind of

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,799
difficult because yeah you need to like

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,799
sort of

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:30,159
dynamically get rid of a window of a

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,159
secondary window and merge it into the

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,799
all right yeah sorry about that isp

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,159
issue i guess i don't know

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,240
no internet anywhere in the house

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,440
uh yeah i'm not sure what that means for

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,640
a schedule because i

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,200
think i didn't have like three minutes

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,760
left but

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,760
yeah i don't know

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,200
well yeah telegram is the only thing

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,200
that worked because like there was like

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,840
i i tried to ping and like basically

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,520
every

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,880
15 seconds like three packages went

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,240
through and

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,960
the website was not loading at all i

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,559
have no idea um

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,840
but yeah i don't know like this do any

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,240
of the organizers want to tell me what

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,919
to do

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,919
like should we just cancel it at this

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,919
point because yeah i can't finish it in

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,640
two minutes

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,159
i can go until 53. uh all right yeah

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,400
maybe we can make that work

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,080
i'll try to be faster so yeah there's

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,760
there's some more stuff to be done on

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,320
system dialogues there's ongoing work

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,120
but yeah

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,480
this needs to be this needs some more

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,640
work basically

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,520
um but yeah let's get to the really cool

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,480
part of the talk

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,679
which is gtk4 stuff so um as you know

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,919
gtk4 is out

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,120
um there's not that many apps using it

00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,559
yet but like it

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,480
we're like at the point where we can

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,919
start porting to it very soon

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,080
um and there's like a few things in

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,880
particular that i'm very excited about

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,760
um the first of those is animation and

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,840
that's just like in general but like

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,440
specifically a few a few things that

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,480
that we can do now that we could never

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,720
do before

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,559
is things like this which is like proper

00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,520
physics based animation of like various

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,120
different things

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,120
uh this is a demo that alexander put

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,520
together and i think with some help from

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,360
manuel genovese also they really like

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,440
that the amazing job like making

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,880
the proper physics based spring

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,559
animations work

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,730
and this is like all gtk you know it

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,840
feels weird you know to to

00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,279
[Music]

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,120
be saying that or you know what i mean

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,200
like but uh

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,480
yeah this is like a whole new world of

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,600
animations that we could never really do

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,880
before

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:32,159
um and yeah the

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,679
the next thing that's probably we're not

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,000
going to be using a whole lot but

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,520
it is something that's that's cool to

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,039
have like for a lot of like sort of

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,000
smaller details

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,120
um similar to on the web i think is 3d

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,080
transforms

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,039
and here's a very interesting demo of

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,840
something that we're definitely not

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,840
gonna do

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,960
um but like stuff that shows off the

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,200
power of this a little bit

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,320
where it's like a full like 3d

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,840
environment

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,919
um and yeah this is all gtk4 so

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,600
yeah a 3d transform is something that

00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,480
that we could never really

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,200
never really do before um with gdk

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,880
widgets

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,360
and that we will be able to do with gta

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,520
4 and yeah

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,279
it's it's it's one of those things that

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,559
that

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,400
that's great to have in your tool set

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,679
even if you don't use it that time but

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
really the thing that i think i'm most

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,240
excited about

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,679
is probably just the ability to scale

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,279
things um

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,200
because that was kind of like a huge

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,440
bottleneck for a lot of like the nicer

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,799
animation stuff in gta 3 because we

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,720
could move things but like

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,159
actually scaling them is is really

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,919
important for a lot of the things that

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,520
you actually want to do with animation

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,279
um especially when it comes to like you

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,320
know transitioning between states and so

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,000
on

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,799
um and yeah that is something that we

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,200
can finally do and this this demo i

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,360
think

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,760
really shows off uh what you can do with

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,840
that also huge kudos to alexander for

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,039
for putting that together um so on

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,200
desktop or like on

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,799
a large size you like have sort of a

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,679
regular tab bar

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,880
um and like if you resize it use it like

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,760
get this mobile thing but

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,159
also um there's this button that you can

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,120
click

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,640
and it like actually zooms out the tab

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,600
and it gives you a grid

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,960
with sort of like all the other tabs and

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,240
this is the kind of ui that

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,159
personally like i you know

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,320
i'm not sure how familiar you are with

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,919
like my history of giving talks but like

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,120
this is my very first vladik talk was

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,320
about basically this kind of stuff like

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,720
semantic animation like

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,520
these kind of like state transitions um

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,279
between

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,880
so like complete completely different

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,840
states that are like totally especially

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,000
clean

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,440
um and yeah this i could not be more

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,159
excited about the kind of stuff

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,120
that's that we're going to be able to do

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,480
this kind of stuff

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,640
and also one interesting thing that this

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,919
demo does is this very cool

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:46,960
uh like uh sort of like clean

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,600
uh spatial uh

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,720
color switcher um i think it's using

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,360
shaders or something i don't really

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,440
understand this

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,120
you can ask alexander in the chat but

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,240
yeah this is the kind of amazing

00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,679
that we're going to be able to do with

00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,840
gtk4

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,120
one final demo uh that kind of puts it

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,760
all together into

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,400
one really awesome uh package the first

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,760
one

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,559
uh which is basically like the ability

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,840
to morph layouts and like keep elements

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,520
around so like here we have these

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,919
wallpapers and like a label and

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,679
this this icon and i can click one and

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,840
it not only scales up the welder but it

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,919
keeps the text and the icon around

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,960
where basically like they actually move

00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,120
to their new position

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,320
i'm sure like you can see zero of these

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,200
things

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,559
in the actual stream but um um yeah i'm

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,000
gonna put links somewhere where you can

00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,760
actually build these yourself but

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,200
if this is the kind of stuff that i've

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,600
been personally waiting for for

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,960
many years to be able to do this in gtk

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,000
and it's amazing that this is finally on

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,600
the horizon

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,039
uh so yeah quick summary since we have

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,760
probably like two more minutes

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,559
um mainline phone linux phones are a

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,279
real thing now

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,799
um you know developers have them and are

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,440
making using them to make really awesome

00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,240
stuff

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,039
um our app ecosystem is like going it up

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,960
with left and right

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,320
it's really cool um our developer

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,120
experience with the widgets library and

00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,200
the higg is

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,039
looking better than ever and yeah some

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,200
really cool stuff there on the horizon

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,799
and gtk4 stuff i mean yeah do i need to

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,520
say anything else like

00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:09,039
this looks so amazing like it's yeah

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,279
it's really a whole world

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,159
so yeah that's just to say the future

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,760
looks really bright
