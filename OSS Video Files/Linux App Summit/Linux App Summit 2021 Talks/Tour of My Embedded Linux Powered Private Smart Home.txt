Title: Tour of My Embedded Linux Powered Private Smart Home
Publication date: 2021-05-30
Playlist: Linux App Summit 2021 Talks
Description: 
	Rather than expose your smart home device data and voice commands “to the cloud” (i.e., to large tech titans as well as smart product manufacturers), this talk demonstrates how you can maintain better privacy over it. The "secret" is free and open source, spun out of Mozilla to be community led, and easy to set up and manage. (Spoiler: the central hub runs the WebThings Gateway). Since data are processed and stored locally, there's no need to give up your privacy, and even if your Internet goes down, your smart home still works.

Kathy will take you on a tour of her own smart home, then demonstrate the simplicity of MicroBlocks for building your own “smart devices”, such as motion sensors, temperature sensors, door/window sensors, pushbuttons, lights, and more.



Author(s) Bio

Kathy fills her desk with hardware, especially microcontroller boards that can be programmed using MicroBlocks, a learning tool for physical computing. While at Mozilla, she worked on the WebThings Project, which successfully launched a "gateway" software stack that can run on a Raspberry Pi, and act as a hub for a myriad of smart home and IoT devices. She received her bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Minnesota, and her master's in EE from Stanford University. When not at a computer, she can usually be found exploring the great outdoors of northern California.

Q&A


 1. Have you writiten documentation or reviews about these different systems?
 
 2. Is there any major implication when IPv6 becomes a standard worldwide in terms of security in embedded systems, regarding information transmission over wireless or wired transmisison lines?
 
 3. What is your opinion. Is Tor hidden service is the perfect tool for exposing IoT home server? Besides encrypted channel, only you know services address. And if there is a zero day, automatically hacking atacks simlpy don't know where is you exposed server. Noone should know you have a smart home, right?
 
 4. Are there any IoT devices talking in a proprietary protocol? If yes, how does Web of Things deal with it?
 
 5. What are your opinions on the Home Assistant project?

 6. Do you think that, quote "data explosion" happens only when we save all this data, typically in a cloud? Should our devices be more forgetful?

 7. What other cloud services we can use other than Google Cloud to potentiate the features and usability of our IoT devices? I won a IoT device but it comes with a Google Cloud service by default and it's a huge amount of code just to have it working. How other systems handles with these types of online services?

8. Is there a way to set up a secondary Pi to take over in case your main one were to fail?

9. Is there any hardware kit already available to get started?

 10. Can you show addon for a cat? We use microBlocks to write it? :)

okay hello everyone from uh

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,080
probably the other side of the world for

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,400
most of you i'm in california

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,519
and uh i come to you giving you a short

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,759
presentation

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,719
of some great open source projects

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,320
including uh

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,960
web things where i may give you a tour

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,119
of my home how i can maintain a smart

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,400
home that's all private to me

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,519
or as much as possible private to me so

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,720
uh let's see how do i advance

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,960
my slides

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,960
um

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,840
sorry didn't do the

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,800
presentation oh there we go right there

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,960
the right arrow

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,000
okay so just a little bit about me so

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,840
i've been in the

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,079
technology industry for a really long

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,239
time i came out here

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,360
to go to grad school and ended up my

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,399
first job was like

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,719
for tran data analysis of electric field

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,680
mills doing all sorts of cool stuff

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,840
um i've just been involved in doing

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,519
things with you know linux and

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,600
tools and open source for a very long

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,720
time and more recently

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,960
i'm trying to spend a lot of my

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,200
volunteer time applying open source

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,640
technology into the education space so

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,600
i'm going to be showing you a little bit

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,640
about

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,040
a great project we call microblocks

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,119
which was developed by the founder of

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,840
one of the founders of scratch

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,000
and it's how you can do physical

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,920
computing with a blocks based language

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,680
and it actually applies really well to

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,200
the internet of things because anything

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,200
with connectivity

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,799
can be turned into what we call a web

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,240
thing now

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:43,520
um i'm going to skip the

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,040
boring introduction about myself because

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,640
the first thing i want to do is take you

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,880
through some of the parameters

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,479
of why privacy and security are

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,280
important i'm sure you all understand

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,200
that but

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,520
basically i wrote down on this slide the

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,840
concerns i have for my own home

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,680
which is you know security i don't want

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,680
hackers being able to attack me like

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,759
they did the colonial pipeline

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,840
recently you know you don't want cyber

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,800
attacks um

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,520
privacy that's like super important to

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,000
me

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,040
not as important to everyone but for me

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,520
just when a door

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,080
opens and closes when there's motion in

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,680
the home

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,440
when there's network presence of the

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,840
devices in the home

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,599
uh when lights are switched on and off

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,520
all of that type of information is

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,760
really a blueprint for when

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,040
people are home when a home is occupied

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,440
or not

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,080
and if that information were stored in

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,440
the cloud

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,120
and somehow hacked and millions of homes

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,360
you know tens of millions of homes had

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,000
occupancy data that would be a great

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,280
you know dark web data set for someone

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,040
to know

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,480
you know what if you come and go for

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,519
work and when you break into your home

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,400
or not i mean but

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,160
to me that's just just the tip of the

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,760
iceberg there's all sorts of privacy

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,440
concerns i have but

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,800
you know mainly it's just like you don't

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,280
want to live in a glass house

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,200
right and by exposing all your data

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,239
that's what you're doing

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,959
the um the other third

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,000
main problem of smart home is

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,159
interoperability

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,080
like you can buy into one system and use

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,519
that system for everything you do

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,360
but you're kind of stuck on what that

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,959
vendor offers you

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,800
and it's really hard to do your own

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,920
thing or mix and match or grow it over

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,280
time

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,840
so what i'm going to be demonstrating

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,599
today really is a growth of something

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,760
over time i didn't like put it all

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,599
together in one fell swoop

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,360
and and lastly um at least for me if i

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,840
hadn't worked at mozilla

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,560
on the web things project and gotten my

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,319
hands on

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,640
a lot of different smart home devices

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,239
and really got intimate about how they

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,560
worked and which ones

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,519
you know connect over a radio that's

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,239
non-iip

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,920
protocol like zigbee or z-wave connect

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,000
only to my device

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,599
if i wasn't like doing that full-time as

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,319
a job when would i

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,080
ever have had the time to research all

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,000
the different devices out there all the

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,840
different systems and tools so

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,760
in addition to having some you know

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,400
interoperability and ease of use i think

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,680
the overall

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,040
value is to consumers to help them

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,840
understand

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,280
what devices are easy to use and why

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,599
what ones protect your

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,639
privacy or not you know those kinds of

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,479
things is

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,040
something we need to wrap into the whole

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,120
system so what i'm showing you today is

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,080
definitely a you know a

00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,840
developer-centric

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,400
uh view i think but it has commercial

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,040
implications

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,320
one of the main differences in the

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,840
approach we took

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,080
with the web things project at mozilla

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,759
which is by right now by the way a

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,199
community project so if you want to get

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,960
ahead of myself

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,479
uh webthings.io um in one of the tabs

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,759
and you can look up the project

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:50,800
basically my home runs on a replica

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,240
in this case the data center is the

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,199
raspberry pi

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,160
in my house and so your home is your

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,479
data center

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,280
and you only use the cloud for example

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,800
to

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,440
access from your smart home um

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,199
you know the web interface oops so that

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,240
when you're away from home you can still

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,479
monitor and

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,560
and that tunnels through the the

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,600
internet over https

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,199
so it's https access only instead a

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,080
typical vendor and this is just a web

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,400
page

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,520
a progressive web app that i have you

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,080
know as a

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,120
as an icon on my desktop so i just click

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,680
the icon

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,280
and i'm right in the app otherwise i

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,000
have loads of apps that i've had to

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,080
download

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,080
just for the initial installation of for

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,160
example wi-fi devices

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,840
and if you have this system of all these

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,880
different vendors you end up with

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,000
hundreds of

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:45,680
like different apps and interoperability

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,160
between them becomes very cumbersome

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,840
all right so those are some of the

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,120
problems looking at interoperability

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,199
itself

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,840
what the web of things does is there's a

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,280
standards body group called in the w3c

00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,680
called the web of things which this

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,800
project is based on and it just says all

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,080
we're going to do is we're going to tie

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,919
all these different protocols

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,280
all these different messaging methods

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,000
we're going to put them all together

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,600
at the web layer so that web services

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,680
json definitions

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,720
essentially describe these different

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,680
things and they have

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,680
actions events and properties properties

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,360
being the main thing

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,440
and so new coming along the one that was

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,880
called connected home over ip is now

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,280
renamed to matter and i think zb zigbee

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,639
was renamed to something else recently

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,720
but it doesn't really matter you can

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,759
bring them all together and so your own

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,160
private home

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,199
consists of sort of this web things

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,199
gateway

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,520
things that you buy you can also build

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,880
things and then you just manage it all

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,080
under one

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,080
one roof essentially and i wrote a

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,599
tutorial that really needs to be updated

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,919
because it's still got mozilla branding

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,800
all over it but there is information

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,720
on the wiki uh the web things framework

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,599
there's all sorts of libraries that

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,319
take um that give you in different

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,360
languages

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,520
ways to create web things out of data

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,800
you know everything from arduino and

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,800
micro blocks to

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:13,840
uh you know python and javascript and

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,240
rust even and then

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,440
microblocks like i said is what i use to

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,479
program

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,400
microcontrollers typically and i can

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,240
turn these things into web things with

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,919
just the addition of a library and a few

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,400
additional blocks that say

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,120
you know i have a temperature property

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,280
and uh

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,400
and it shows me the degrees celsius or

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,840
fahrenheit or whatever i want

00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,800
microblocks.fun is another tab to open

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,800
up on your browser

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,639
and just to show you a little bit behind

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,639
the scenes when i

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,479
open uh the microblocks ide

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,879
i get a library list and i have the

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,240
capabilities the properties actions

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,479
and events actually it only does

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,280
properties and events in this library

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,000
and then i can create smart lights smart

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,879
um

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,680
motion sensors door sensors temperature

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,039
sensors

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,599
and all you have to do is pull the

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,720
blocks together and behind those blocks

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,120
so all i have to do is

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,160
behind the blocks is the actual holes on

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,280
and so i can turn

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,360
one of these uh micro bit boards really

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,759
easily into a smart light

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,080
into you know it has an onboard motion

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,400
sensor could be a smart motion sensor

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,840
and these extra blocks in red are the

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,840
web things blocks

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,680
and all it's doing in this case is i

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,039
could use a button to toggle the light

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,000
on and off

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,120
with the actual device or with my web

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,360
browser

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,719
i just toggle the icon on and off and i

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,640
didn't have to build the web page

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,320
because the raspberry pi does that

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:47,360
and the blocks on web things do the rest

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:49,519
so iot for education becomes really easy

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,200
now extending an alternative to the web

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,880
things get it would be to use something

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,680
like snap where you can just build

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,480
your user interface and and snap is

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,480
another

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,000
blocks based language that runs on your

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,600
laptop through browser

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,880
and it's just awesome and amazing

00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,200
snap.berkeley.edu

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,959
and just a little hint about how

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,080
microblocks actually works is these

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,920
blocks

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,680
are actually the programs that are

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,160
running behind them there's these op

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,160
codes that turn into machine code that

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,600
actually runs on the bare metal of the

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,120
microcontroller so there's actually a

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,880
virtual machine

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,519
that is running the blocks and then when

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,120
you just can disconnect the

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,320
microcontroller from your laptop the

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,399
blocks are still running in the

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,279
microcontroller so it does run in

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,080
fully autonomously in an untethered

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,080
situation

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,440
so it really is a fantastic language

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,760
compared to

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,680
something like arduino which i've worked

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,720
for and used in the past this is so much

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,720
better

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,240
and there's a virtual machine to build

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,560
for all these different microcontrollers

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,200
we use platform io as the tool for that

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,240
because

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,760
it's just phenomenal for any text-based

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,880
framework that you want to build

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,360
for microcontrollers so if you uh

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,720
clone the git repository you can build

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,399
microblocks for

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,440
whatever boards are supported which is

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,120
in the platform i o any file

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,399
just a picture you'll see we have some

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,640
online demos on

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,160
my youtube account something about iot

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,120
and privacy

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,959
uh there's a raspberry pi and a speaker

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,160
and

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,839
speaker microphone i'm going to

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,920
demonstrate that live so i'm not going

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,079
to show this video

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,320
that's sitting over in the other room

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,680
and then the web things links

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,320
just going to show you a few links here

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:35,839
web things dot io is sort of the

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:38,480
starting point for that um

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,440
i have some youtube playlists for both

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,720
microblocks

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,000
and iot and i can share this entire

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,079
presentation

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,440
there's if you have if you subscribe to

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,000
make magazine

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,399
or you can just go to the online version

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,040
of make magazine and get it for free

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:59,200
um issues 72 and 74 if i'm

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,560
if i remember correctly one has the web

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,480
things

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,160
article i wrote and one has the

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,519
microblocks article and all the

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,519
different microcontrollers you can use

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,040
and if you want to get involved this

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,320
just has a bunch of information

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,480
about how to contact me my twitter and

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,399
linkedin handles

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,240
and then just to note that the other

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,360
thing i love about open source and

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,320
community different pro

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,600
driven projects is that early on i

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,959
pushed hard to get web things

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,160
translation

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:33,279
uh into the project the same tools

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,399
pontoon and fluent

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,200
for uh translating firefox of the same

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,279
tools used to

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,279
translate web things so you can you can

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,440
convert web things from just

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,959
picking your language and the

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,480
translators wanted for all these

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,240
different languages

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,959
for microblocks the translation is a

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,959
little different there's

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,360
the one language like english translate

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,680
to another language and then

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,279
uh once that's available you can also

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,760
change the ide to many different

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,240
languages

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,680
so this is a summary of like microblocks

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,720
web things platform io

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,800
snap four great awesome open source

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,279
projects with with really excellent uh

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,120
educational potential i feel

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,959
and there's one more that i wanted to

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,760
introduce um

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,639
for two reasons one is that i started

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,920
working for

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,680
a commercial company that takes

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,800
advantage of this linux foundation open

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,959
source project

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,959
and the second thing like there's a big

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,920
example of it lately the canon

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,560
colonial pipeline in the east coast of

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,560
states they're

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,680
having all sorts of gas shortage issues

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,560
with people

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,519
hoarding gas because there was a cyber

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,079
attack on this colonial pipeline

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,800
and so the next project what it what it

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,440
aims to do

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,480
is to take embedded linux products that

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,000
are

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,040
deployed at the edge and make a secure

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,160
conduit

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,839
to the cloud for them and rather than

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,040
sort of

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,639
you know worrying about lots of

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,200
different linux distros and lots of

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,600
different

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,279
applications running at the edge there's

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,279
a linux foundation project

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,279
called e for um

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,920
sort of for a virtualization or

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,240
containerized approach to the edge where

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,279
you have the thinnest shim of a linux

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,440
kernel

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,320
running on hardware and it basically

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,639
does all the virtualization it's it's

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,000
it utilizes alpine which is really

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,680
supposed to be a

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,320
thin shim and then you deploy

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,399
applications through the secure conduit

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,000
and only the controller conduit can run

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,760
them so i really do

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
have you know pretty good faith that

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,760
we'll be able to stop some of these

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,199
cyber attacks that are occurring because

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,399
of all of these exposed

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:47,279
edge iot devices and this project you

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,240
can find

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,760
um on linux foundation and then on

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,120
github

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,160
and there's an open source

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,680
implementation where eve has an os

00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,760
version that runs on the edge and then

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,639
you can use a command line controller

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,480
or there's a commercial instance at the

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,240
company i'm currently contracted for

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,160
called zida

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,600
and so you find that as a linux

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,880
foundation so that's another great

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,959
project for

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,959
sort of the security and privacy around

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,279
iot

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,959
now on the demo side i'm going to focus

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,160
on two things first

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:25,440
smart where i keep prompting and

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,920
secondly i'm going to spend a little

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,920
time

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,959
on the micro block side so you can see

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,519
how how cool it is to be able to

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,120
program you know microcontrollers and

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,440
turn them into

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,320
physical computing devices and if they

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,279
have connectivity

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:48,560
iot devices so without further ado

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:52,240
i'm going to share my screen

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,240
and i don't know if um

00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,880
[Music]

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,079
i don't know if it's going to be

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,079
possible to

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,560
minimize the slides then

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:19,519
so i want to close this there we go

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:23,279
look at that now you're seeing my

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:25,519
my web browser okay so the first thing i

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:29,120
want to do here

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:31,920
is i need to open this window so you can

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,920
actually see it

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,079
okay so this is what i'm sharing what i

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,120
want to show you is this is just an

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:45,040
interface of either virtual objects or

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:47,120
real objects in the case of an ip camera

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,120
i have one that points outside the front

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,519
door of my home and it looks you know

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,160
out of the front sidewalk you can see

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:57,120
cars in the driveway or on the street

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,759
helps you see that and that's just again

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,480
snapshotted through the browser

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,399
these are sensors that are air quality

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,000
sensors that come through an add-on so

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,560
the whole framework of this

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,399
web of things is that there's a core you

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,920
know javascript object notation

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,440
for defining all these things in a

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,000
standard way

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,720
but then once they are represented then

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,160
any

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,320
object you can open up its

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,279
splat icon and see the details and you

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,399
can see various

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:29,920
information about it um

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,279
and so this you know air quality sensor

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,360
is actually within a

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,440
kilometer of my house but it's not my

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,279
air quality sensor it's something i've

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,519
pulled in the data from the internet and

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,759
so i can use it to determine

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,759
when to close my windows and doors in

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,839
the summer when there's wildfires in the

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,560
area which has been a problem lately

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,600
and this this exact um add-on the air

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:54,240
quality purple purpleair.com

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,920
add-on was a request by me and a

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,720
developer in germany actually put it

00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,680
together

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,360
in in a day to help me know when to

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,079
close my windows and doors

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,120
and so i have a rule of an upstairs

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,640
screen door

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,640
that if it's open in the middle of the

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,559
night and the air quality like the wind

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,799
shifts directions the air quality goes

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,839
into the bad unhealthy range

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:17,120
then i have the little speaker alert me

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,280
and wake me up in the

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,160
middle of the night even 3am and i close

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,760
the door

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,839
and all i have to do is close the door

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,720
and the rule will change

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,799
to um stop saying that so if i actually

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,799
go into the rules here

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,080
the beauty of it again of being all in

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,480
one place

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,000
is that then i have rules to tell me

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,160
okay so bad air

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,840
if door open so if i look at that rule

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,240
what i was just describing when the air

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,520
quality goes above a certain amount

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,000
and the upper deck door is open and it's

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,320
an even

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,200
minute it's going to alert me with bad

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,240
air

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,919
until i reset you know until the air

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,440
quality goes lower or i close

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,120
basically all i have to do is close the

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,480
door so

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,559
that's really cool and then um

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,919
what i said you know about the beauty of

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,919
the add-ons

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,760
before i take you around on tour i just

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,679
wanted to show you how that works so

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,320
there's rules

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,760
um for all of this tying things together

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,120
there's logging

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,280
so i just want to quickly show you what

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,919
that means so you know when the entry

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,160
door was

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,679
you know open and closed some motion in

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,360
the tv area

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,440
which is near the kitchen area when the

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,960
front door was open things like that so

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,280
there's all sorts of

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,320
temperatures and earthquakes and motions

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,200
and tides and

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,360
air quality and so all of this stuff is

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,840
logged for seven days

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,679
um over a period of time and then i also

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,440
have it laid out over a floor plan

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,039
if i want to do floor plan view but i

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,799
have so many things now that i

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:49,120
i tend to use the other view and then

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,120
just so you know this is a raspberry pi

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,240
connected on the wi-fi network you could

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,640
also plug it in over

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,400
ethernet the domain is something you set

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,360
on your own so you have your own private

00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,200
domain

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,039
i'm actually connected locally not

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,600
through the internet right now

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,760
the whole system actually works without

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,919
internet access it all runs locally if

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,080
my internet broadband is down

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,720
my local network will still continue to

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,480
function my users as many as i want for

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,799
logging in

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,559
the localization as i mentioned before

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,360
is just going to be

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,360
for date time rules and parameters and

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,840
then the languages

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,440
pick your language there and then also

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,240
pick your units of

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,080
whether you want imperial or celsius

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,520
units i always use

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,280
metric um so going back

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,080
experiments there's developer things

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,760
like you can go into the detailed logs

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,400
create authorizations and whether you

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,919
want to enable ssh into your pi

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,320
and then the updates at least for the

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:51,440
raspberry pi version are automatic

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,080
so it keeps me up to date and then i'll

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,120
go into

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,559
add-ons is really the name of the game

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,320
and if you want to see add-ons even

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,840
without having this installed

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:05,039
while i go along you can do

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,280
um web things

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,400
dot web things dot io port eight four

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,240
four three

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:15,679
slash add-on slash info and it shows you

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,760
um all of these add-ons and what these

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:21,120
add-ons do is it takes

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:24,320
commercial data or internet

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:27,120
services data takes data from

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,200
anywhere on the internet or any device

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,159
and converts it into this standardized

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,880
w3c

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,880
web of things

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,200
thing descriptions and then

00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:40,000
interoperability

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,720
of rules and so forth is based on having

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,240
all the data cents in this common

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,760
framework so those are our atoms so if i

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,960
go and look at the add-ons i have

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,960
installed

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,200
you can see how i configure them so the

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,559
date and time depends on my latitude and

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,679
longitude

00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,080
and i can offset some sunrise sunrise so

00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,919
i have

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,120
actually outdoor led lighting in my

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,520
front porch

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,440
that depends on rules of when is sunset

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,799
so rather than keep changing the time

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,880
for the time you know for

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,000
as the years change and it gets darker

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,240
or lighter

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,240
i just have the lights go on at sunset

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,559
and go off at 10 pm

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,440
i never have to change the rule and then

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:22,480
i monitor earthquakes from the usgs

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,440
online data set and i can say how far

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,480
away i want them

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:29,200
to to look from my house and

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,960
the magnitude and so we might get some

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,880
browser alerts that tell

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,400
you know when when there's a earthquake

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,919
there was one right before i started

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,960
this talk but

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:42,400
even 1.0 earthquakes occur like

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,960
all day long so we tend to get some

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,559
and then the google homes i have a

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,400
couple of them in my house they're set

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,159
on mute so i don't actually use them for

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,880
smart assistance at all

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,159
or rarely i might unmute them to do

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,400
something but

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,679
um i use them to talk to me you know

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,960
that i find that they're just

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:03,679
excellent um text to speech

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,559
um things so i i have these all these

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,480
preset

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,000
hand things that i have assigned to

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,120
rules so if there's an earthquake over

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,880
5.0

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,760
i want to see where it was and how big

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,720
it was and maybe go into the usgs data

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,200
site

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,360
when we're out of the home i said a rule

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,799
that there's an intruder alert and any

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,360
door that gets opened

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,640
you know the multiple door sensors will

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,640
present this you know

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,159
loud announcements you can also set the

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,440
volume on these announcements of

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,799
unauthorized persons

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,360
you know you know authority being

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,280
contacted which is authority being me

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,280
um because i get slack messages through

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,280
a notification add-on

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,120
and then i have a water sensor under my

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,440
sink so if there's a leak under there it

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,039
will

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,000
notify me um porch motion i usually use

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,080
that rule off

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,919
but sometimes if i'm expecting a package

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,520
delivery or something i'll turn that

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,919
notification on and then

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,400
if i'm somewhere i i i'm notified that

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,720
someone came out to the porch

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,640
uh the bad air quality you know that's

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,080
another you know wildfire problem we

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,559
have in california

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,559
i have my rule set up for 2022. happy

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,159
new year but you can have happy birthday

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,520
you know when somebody walks in the door

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,960
and the door opens you can

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,559
wish them a happy birthday i've done

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,679
that before for my husband it's kind of

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,440
fun

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,240
um and then i have a couple things of

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,679
just be aware like the leak detection or

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,760
the garage door left open i have a

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,039
little timer set for five minutes and if

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,039
the garage isn't set

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,600
isn't closed after five minutes then it

00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:33,440
you know just says check the garage door

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:36,799
um you know for might have left it open

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,000
accidentally the pulse adapter is really

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,400
cool you can just create

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,440
toggles and buttons and things and time

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,760
out things for

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,919
whatever you want i have this everything

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,960
pulse which is always on and when i turn

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,200
it off

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,559
it turns off all my powered devices like

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,159
lights in the home

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:55,520
very convenient here's that purple air

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,000
adapter again it's just

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,679
just saying how how many sensors within

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,799
a kilometer of my home do i want to

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,919
monitor

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:06,159
and then i can add them to my gateway

00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,480
scene control is like

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,159
red alert lighting again when the

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,480
intrusion detection

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,279
triggers it turns all of my lights on

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,600
that are

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,640
that are smart lights and it turns all

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,440
the colored lights

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,679
into red so whole house lights up and

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,320
everything that can be red is red

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,360
so that's kind of a fun um scene control

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,159
thing

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,840
scheduler i used a lot for the holidays

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,000
you know i have my christmas lights and

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,919
stuff downstairs turn on

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,840
even before i got out of bed and came

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,440
downstairs and you have the whole house

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,320
is dark and then you have the shimmering

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,400
little

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,080
lights and it was really pretty and i

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,440
could set the schedule for different

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,640
days of the week when i get up at

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,520
different times

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,360
to make sure they always came on slack

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,840
is just a notification

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,279
again for getting messages directly to

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,679
my phone

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,679
sonos is the way i play internet

00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,000
streamed music

00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,000
and the tide in redwood city where i go

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,760
rowing there's they're all

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,080
you know like i say most of these things

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,840
are either a station where you're

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,039
fetching this data or some sort of

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,880
um means for getting these internet

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:15,279
services data it's really cool to bring

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,760
all of this data into you and then

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:21,279
another one of my favorite adapters voco

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,960
is uses the now acquired by sono

00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,640
snips libraries but they were open

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,520
source libraries and one of the mozilla

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,600
developers

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,520
initially did a demonstration of it and

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,279
another guy in the netherlands

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,039
picked it up and made it even a lot

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,440
better

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,600
uh and you basically have a speaker

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,720
microphone and you speak to it locally

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,360
and it implements

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,960
these um you know commands the same

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,400
commands as i can do through my web

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,960
interface i can now do

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,039
through my voice and it has some extra

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,320
things like setting timers and

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,080
setting something on or off for a

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,400
certain amount of time so

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,000
it's uh that is just like one of my

00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,760
favorite add-ons

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,320
there's another one called voice control

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,640
but it uses the

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,400
mozilla deep speech library it doesn't

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,840
actually work as well so i recommend

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,799
voco

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,080
and then the weather again is just a

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,120
latitude of longitude

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:16,000
of where i am and the web

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,960
thing is the is actually the sort of the

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,240
standard

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,400
and so when i build things with

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,320
microblocks i use the

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,080
the wi-fi things show up as just

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,679
standard web things

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,600
and then i have a couple other devices

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,799
and i use a lot of the battery operated

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,640
things i use

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,720
almost all of the probably all of the

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,760
battery operated things i use are zigbee

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,279
because it's a very good

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:40,080
low power um

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,120
good low power uh protocol in fact i

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,080
have

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,880
you know right here is a backroom motion

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,799
sensor

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:52,000
and so that's that's worked really well

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,760
on battery so i just mentioned the

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,279
voice so before we do anything i just

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,720
want to say that i can

00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,080
um test like if if you're worried about

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,240
your voice commands is it

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,320
is it detecting your voice commands

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,840
correctly or is it just that the system

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,600
isn't set up to understand what you're

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,279
trying to say so you do need to know the

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,720
name of the things

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,960
and if you know the name of the things

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,320
and you can say select turn

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:20,080
on tv bulb

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:23,120
for one minute and i can

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:26,000
send that and that turns into a

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,120
timed event and so it says you know it's

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,799
and she's gonna

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,200
little speaker will announce when it

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,240
goes off so now we can go over to that

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,399
area

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,399
and at some point this tv bulb is going

00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:39,200
to go off so let's go over here

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,799
and see this is the tv bulb that that

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,520
went on

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,399
i could you know use my maybe we'll go

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,039
over there and

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:49,120
we'll change the color of the bulb as

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:52,559
the first thing we'll do

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:57,039
using my voice so now

00:27:52,559 --> 00:28:01,360
let me just check and you'll see

00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:02,480
um okay so you see the screen and then

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,000
you see

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,760
you'll be able to i'm going to show you

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,320
sensors like

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,399
right up there so hopefully i'll do my

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,720
best there's an actual door sensor up

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,279
there

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,880
for backside door but now i'm going to

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:18,399
walk you over to

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,399
the main hub of things

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,159
which is the raspberry pi

00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,039
so she just announced that she was

00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:32,080
setting the timer

00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:34,200
back to off so now we would have to

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,000
actually go in there

00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,840
[Music]

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,279
i'm going to just going to turn it back

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,960
on again

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:50,480
and then i can say

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,480
hey snips turn the tv bulb to orange

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,480
okay so now the tv bulb is orange you

00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,360
can see that this is the

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,200
tv area motion sensor so the motion

00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:05,679
sensor is triggered

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:08,720
and then this is the uh

00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,399
the google home that we can

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,240
we can pretend that something has

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:14,720
happened like if the garage door was

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,960
left open

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,720
check the garage door since it seems to

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,559
have been left open

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,600
and so that's the type of alert i would

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:27,039
get when something like that happens

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:29,520
um i could also if the bad air quality

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,520
happens

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:35,279
check air quality it's moving from

00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:38,399
moderate to unhealthy

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:41,120
and so it just alerts me and significant

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:43,039
earthquakes and things like that so now

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:46,080
we have this um

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:50,000
tv bulb on i also have a sonos

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:55,840
connected and i can say

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,840
hey snips turn on the sonos

00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:09,840
okay and so what happens is now this is

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:09,840
turned on and if i walk over here

00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,559
and i also have a physical button this

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,159
is an ikea zigbee button so i can turn

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:25,120
things on and off the

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:27,919
music on and off with this i could turn

00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,520
it on and off with the playing button

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,919
and right now it's basically just

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,240
playing radio swiss jazz

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,480
and so i can just also turn it on and

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,760
off just like that

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:42,080
okay so that's pretty cool this uh

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,399
you know the color of this can be all

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:49,440
sorts of different colors so

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:53,360
if i turn it to let's say magenta

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:56,399
then you should see a change right there

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,080
um and then i just want to show you you

00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,240
know it's all the simple things that are

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,159
actually really useful like the

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,840
entry door to the house is through this

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,080
garage door and it's right here a

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,880
samsung smartthings sensor

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,120
that should be this door right here and

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,720
so when i open the door

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,720
you see that it shows that it's open

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:20,720
and closed and i can trigger various

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:23,840
things based on those actions

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:29,039
and um then

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:29,039
over here i have some outdoor

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,880
i don't know if you can see but outdoor

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,120
cafe lighting out there

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,399
and i have this button i could use to

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,080
turn it on

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,760
i don't know if you can see those lights

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,760
turn on out there

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,760
but i can also use my voice even from

00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:48,799
across the room i can say

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,799
hey snips turn off the string

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,480
and she says setting power string to off

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,000
and it turns off

00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,760
and then i have this virtual button

00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,960
that's everything that just says turn

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,039
everything off

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,399
i click it and all of my lights would go

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:05,120
off

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,919
so again there's a just going to take

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,600
you on a

00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,440
quick another little tour of different

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,840
devices near my

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,080
vid this is my front door so if this is

00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,360
open

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:21,840
um i open the front door

00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:25,039
you'll see front door

00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:27,519
active and then out in the front

00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,080
actually this is like the picture of

00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,360
stuff

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,360
the picture from the other thing that

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,919
you saw and i have

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,120
strip lighting right down here these are

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,320
the leds

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,840
right down in the rocks and the cool

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,120
thing about those leds is because

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,960
they're colored

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,360
i don't even have to set up lights for

00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,279
different seasons and christmas time

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,600
i have two strips one is red one is

00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:51,440
green and halloween they're orange and

00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,519
valentine's day they're pink and fourth

00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,720
of july they're red and blue

00:32:53,519 --> 00:33:00,720
and so that's the that's the

00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,720
garden lighting which is somewhere here

00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,919
down in here and then here's all my air

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,159
quality sensors i have a whole bunch of

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:11,440
them i have my slack alerts

00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:15,279
i have the tide in redwood city

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,039
i have the earthquakes which right now

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:20,640
there's nothing active

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:23,679
within 100 500 kilometers

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,360
um let's see i have like front hall

00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,080
motion sensors

00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,960
this is a little ikea one that's firing

00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,200
right now from that

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,200
i have a desk lamp that goes on

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,080
automatically at sunset

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,120
i have you know buttons scattered

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,559
throughout the house

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,159
just for turning things on and off and

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,919
i just want to show you a little ip

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,000
camera now the ip camera i still don't

00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,880
point inside my house because it's wi-fi

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,600
and

00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,200
it's connected to the internet as well

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,960
it sits right here

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,039
i don't know if you can see that but it

00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,320
sits in this front laundry room

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:04,480
so and there's also a tiny little

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,480
whoops ah i just dropped it

00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:13,040
sorry tiny little zigbee um

00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:16,560
uh this is a xiaomi device that

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,399
does temperature and humidity so

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,079
the humidity was too much that might be

00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:22,800
a problem

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,720
so and then upstairs there's door

00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,760
centers there's

00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,919
uh if i show you there's a garage door

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,079
center again i just use a normal door

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:34,639
center for wanting the garages on and

00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,460
off this is the outdoor leds in the

00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,919
garden and

00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:40,639
[Applause]

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:43,200
various powered things the lamp has a

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,200
timeout

00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,679
other doors and that's you know that's

00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:52,639
there's the themes or the scenes that i

00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:55,760
can set to different things

00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:58,400
and and again the

00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,160
the logging of all the data is really

00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,280
really useful

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:05,760
so i'm going to wrap up with that home

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,040
tour and make sure i leave some time for

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,720
questions

00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:14,320
on that later but now

00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:17,760
i'm going to stop sharing that one

00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,520
and i'm instead and if there are some

00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,440
questions you can ask me interactively

00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,359
you're welcome to

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,440
otherwise i'm going to show you how you

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:28,000
can easily make your own smart home

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,000
devices

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,200
i hope that was somewhat fun you can see

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,200
i've built this home

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,240
you know over a period of time it's not

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,880
like i did it all at once

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,960
okay so now i'm going to share another

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,480
application and this is the microblocks

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,640
ide

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,079
and so what's going to happen is i have

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,440
this little device i was playing with

00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,400
like more than a week ago

00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,079
it's a little servo servo that i can

00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,040
control the motion of

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,000
and it's a little growth sensor and i

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,000
don't remember what

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,200
application i had on here i was like you

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,440
know what did i have

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,960
and so microbox has this awesome feature

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,359
of the blocks i remember

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,160
are on the microcontroller and i want to

00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:11,599
just open

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,960
from board oops wait before i do this i

00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:16,960
need to share

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:20,320
nevermind okay share your screen

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:24,880
and let's see

00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:27,839
select window blocks

00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,839
and allow

00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:33,920
okay now i'm sharing microblocks okay so

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,160
this ide again has many languages

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,000
um you have to get the firmware on a

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,040
microcontroller once in order to do it

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,599
but right now

00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,599
what i want to do is i want to open from

00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,240
board

00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,599
and it says to plug in the board so

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,599
that's i'm going to plug in this

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,200
board right here into one of my usb

00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:54,240
ports

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:58,079
and it has a little grove sensor

00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:01,040
uh servo and

00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,040
plug in the board

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:07,440
oh sorry i've plugged in the board um

00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,280
from the wrong place i need to plug it

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,599
into the microcontroller not the extra

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,800
power sensor

00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,160
okay so plug in the board whoops there

00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,160
we go

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,520
now it's reading the project from the

00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,160
board and

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:24,720
it's taking the blocks on the board and

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,640
basically decompiling them

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,240
and should show me the blocks on my

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:32,800
screen when it's ready

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,359
so how convenient is that and so now i

00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:38,320
can look at my code and say okay

00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:40,400
when i press button a i'm going to move

00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,400
this servo

00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,839
well first of all down when started it

00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:49,440
it has a you know set

00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:53,760
sets pin 2 to or set the servo

00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:57,200
in 12 to a certain amount so if i push

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,200
if i push the a button

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,200
oh right wait hold on push a and then

00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:06,079
push b

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:08,400
it would uh it would move however the

00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,160
servo takes a lot of power

00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,880
and it can't drive it off the three

00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:16,000
volts so

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,599
let me just move this back now i know

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,920
what code is written on here

00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:22,640
let me just do a quick experiment here

00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:26,240
now i unplug the device

00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:28,960
and it complains and i have to apply the

00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,880
power to the board that has the servo

00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,040
now i know what the code looks like and

00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:37,200
i say okay

00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:41,359
press button a what's going to happen

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:44,320
it spins around b it spins one way and

00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:46,960
a it spins another way and so now i know

00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,920
what this does

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,400
and and i just want to show you the

00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,760
really cool part about microblocks is

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,880
unlike

00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:00,640
make code or some of these other things

00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:03,760
i can do stuff um

00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:06,400
in real time it's live and so i'm going

00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,400
to plug in

00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:13,040
i'm going to plug in an led strip here

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,560
onto another pin and this time again i

00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,560
need to plug into the board

00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:24,880
and then i say you know rather than this

00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,880
servo thing i'm just going to say

00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:32,079
new

00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,079
get rid of that project

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,440
and i'm going to load the neopixel

00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,440
library

00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,920
again there's a whole bunch of different

00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,040
libraries for different devices and

00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,200
things

00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:52,640
and then i'm plugging it into i believe

00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,960
there should be 30 leds on here attached

00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,880
to

00:39:52,960 --> 00:40:00,640
pin two and

00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:04,480
let's start that one started let's

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:07,599
define that so if that works

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,520
then we ought to be able to just say set

00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:13,760
all neopixels to green

00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:17,359
and lo and behold they all turned green

00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,960
and so now um you can do all sorts of

00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:22,560
fun things with them you can do

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,640
loops uh you can you know like do from

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,119
from one to another i could i could

00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:30,079
change the color right here

00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,720
and make them all pink and just click

00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:34,800
the block

00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,800
and it's live it just does it

00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:42,400
and then this this actual board um

00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:45,760
has built-in basic sensors

00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,680
like tilt sensors and

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,119
acceleration and so forth so if i

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,000
accelerate it more you'll see those

00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,720
differences

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,839
and it has this cool block of graphing

00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,599
or say

00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:57,280
that you can use and so you can take

00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,480
these sensors like

00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:04,480
the light level and i say

00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:08,240
um you know like forever

00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:12,000
maybe with a little bit of a weight uh

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,880
50 milliseconds put that inside the

00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,680
block with the

00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,680
save lock

00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:21,920
so i have the light level here and now

00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:25,839
if i cover it it goes lower and

00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:29,599
like higher but in addition to say

00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:31,200
i can graph it so let's duplicate this

00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:34,079
block

00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:37,040
and graph it and then i can have the

00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,040
light level here

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:42,880
i'm going to just put zero at the bottom

00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:50,480
and let's see if we can play that

00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:53,520
and now if i cover it you see that

00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:56,640
go down you see it go up

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:59,680
and so now i can look at the light level

00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:01,280
and i could do other things like instead

00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,319
of the light level

00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:08,960
i can do the tilt sensors so let's do

00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:12,640
x and then also what whoops

00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,640
i also want to do y

00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,599
and let's just clear this and then i

00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,400
want

00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:21,680
back at zero in the middle and then i

00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,359
want to forever

00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:30,079
show x and y and now you can tell if i

00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:31,680
tilt it one way

00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:36,079
which sensor and then if i go this

00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,079
direction i believe it's the y parameter

00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,599
that's in the green one and then this

00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,200
one is

00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,960
x and then z

00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,560
is flipping all the way around so

00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,240
they're actually a three axis

00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,839
motion sensor and then if i shake it

00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,760
you'll see the

00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:54,079
so there's libraries like for step

00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,599
counts uh step counting and all sorts of

00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,040
cool things

00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:02,240
and so this is a really fun absolutely

00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,920
like coolest thing in the world

00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,599
because it's so live like the first

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,720
thing you do in uh

00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:11,119
arduino is you you know you blink an led

00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,200
so this has a little led light that you

00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,160
can turn on and off and i can just do

00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,119
that

00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,720
and if i could just uh you know pull

00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,119
these blocks out

00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:26,000
and forever i can turn the led on

00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,000
maybe wait

00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:32,720
200 milliseconds

00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:33,760
duplicate these two blocks to turn it

00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:38,720
off

00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:43,200
and then you know when started

00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:43,200
and this is essentially arduino blink

00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,040
but of course if i wanted to make it

00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,160
more fun

00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,920
i do the led display instead of just one

00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,960
led

00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:59,119
i pull this

00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:02,160
part out and now i should be doing

00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:05,920
a happy face blink

00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,520
oops wait instead of

00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,520
so i can just change it in real time

00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:12,640
when i realize and make a mistake

00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:14,480
clear display instead we'll pull that

00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:17,200
out

00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,160
so now it's doing the happy face blink

00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,960
and so

00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,640
you can realize how how easy it is to do

00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,720
these things and then the

00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,000
libraries for web things going back to

00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,160
iot

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,800
is under network there's this web things

00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:34,560
library and i click that

00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:37,520
and i open it and it has

00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:39,520
a library of things that uh basically do

00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,040
all of that json description behind the

00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,760
scenes for you

00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,079
and so now i have uh you know i i set a

00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,319
thing

00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:51,200
name i set a capability like a light

00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:52,560
so let's call this a micro box thing in

00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,640
the light and i can just give it a

00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,800
boolean property like

00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,680
i have to define at least one variable

00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,960
so

00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:05,599
i've add a variable called on

00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:08,880
and then you know i set

00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:14,160
on to you know true or false

00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:14,160
for starters something like this

00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:20,480
and i could even do

00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,119
i could even do the the led strip for

00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,720
example

00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:28,480
to be on or off and then i give this

00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:33,839
title on and then i start

00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,839
the web thing server

00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,480
and then all i would have to do is like

00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:42,000
wherever

00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,000
this becomes a if

00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:51,119
so this becomes if on

00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,119
grab the on variable

00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,520
if on i'm going to set all of the new

00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:01,280
cells

00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:05,520
to pink else

00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:09,200
i'm going to clear the neopixels

00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:12,400
so we need an else here i'll

00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:14,000
save clearing pixels

00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,079
and then i get rid of all this other

00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,480
stuff

00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:19,119
and so now and and just to be able to

00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,240
test it

00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:25,040
let's do a little control so

00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,040
when uh

00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:31,680
when button a is pressed let's toggle

00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,200
on to the opposite of itself so let's

00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:36,880
toggle on

00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:42,079
oops to

00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:45,760
not on

00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:47,040
not variables

00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,359
sorry it's hard to do all this

00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,400
one-handed while i'm holding this but

00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:54,400
now

00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:57,599
basically uh if i start this program

00:46:54,400 --> 00:47:01,040
and creates a web thing and i

00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:03,680
toggle um

00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,480
the button and it goes from on which it

00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,720
started

00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,880
to not on and so now there's my toggle

00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,040
my button

00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,599
and then at the same time if i were just

00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,599
to uh

00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:19,440
look at the web thing json let's see

00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:22,960
there's a thing description here

00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:25,920
if i look at that this is what the

00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,040
description in javascript is and i can

00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,640
connect this

00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,079
to the raspberry pi and run the

00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,160
microblocks add-on

00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:33,119
this doesn't have wi-fi but i could do a

00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,960
radio

00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,280
remote control to one of them connected

00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:40,240
to the pi and then the other one remote

00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,400
and i have lots of these things and and

00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,240
i could do servo motions to open or

00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,240
close something i could do lights

00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,160
i can do motion detection i could

00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,160
connect one to a door and sense

00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,839
so you can use these microcontrollers to

00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,599
basically create

00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:56,000
all of the different web things that i

00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:59,280
showed you from my commercial devices

00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,520
and so i just wanted to show you a few

00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,520
of these other devices that i've built

00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:06,559
as web things this is a web thing

00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:10,640
um ir controller

00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:13,839
and it's a little um this is the

00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:16,160
m5 stick 6c

00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:16,960
and so it has a little user interface

00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,200
display

00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,200
and then i can use a remote control to

00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:25,040
to toggle it

00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:27,359
this is um i have a

00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,040
couple more micro bits that i just

00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:30,640
turned one i use for temperature and

00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,400
light and one i use for the

00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:35,440
lighting going on and off just as a

00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:38,640
button press this is another bright led

00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:42,000
that i use for things

00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:44,240
i have my own um

00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,319
indoor air quality sensor that i have

00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:48,319
hooked up to a wi-fi device so this is

00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:50,000
also programmed using microblocks as a

00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:52,400
native device

00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,440
this i have set up this is called an m5

00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,559
stack

00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:58,400
and it has a motion sensor pir sensor

00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,599
connected to it so i put this somewhere

00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,000
and this is a battery

00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,640
built in battery so it can run for a

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,040
little while

00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,359
not forever i usually leave it hooked up

00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:11,280
to a battery brick

00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:14,079
and so all this fun stuff basically

00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:17,119
becomes build your own iot devices

00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,720
and then i also have uh so i

00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:20,640
i'm sorry i don't have it set up but i

00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,559
had all those devices hooked up to this

00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:25,280
raspberry pi which also has a

00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:27,760
pimmeroni blinked pie hat on it so i can

00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,920
do individual colored lights on the

00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,839
on the raspberry pi that's running the

00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,520
web things gateway directly

00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,880
and the way you set these things up is

00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,359
just a micro sd

00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,079
card you flash it with an image you plug

00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:39,839
it in

00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,520
you boot it on your network you connect

00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,280
it to your local wi-fi

00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,960
you get a domain name so that you can

00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,839
access it remotely

00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,599
and then boom you're you're ready to go

00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:50,960
so the last thing i'll mention here of

00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:52,640
the

00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,480
micro blocks is there's all sorts of

00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:57,920
cool fun games

00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,040
and libraries if you look you know under

00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,440
under the micro bit

00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,200
and the calliope boards you find tons of

00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:06,559
fun games you can play with it

00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:08,559
as well as music and all sorts of things

00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:11,280
so

00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:13,440
i could uh i have tons of different

00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,520
examples there's also

00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,800
just so you know web of things has its

00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,040
own examples

00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,240
of how you can set this thing up as a

00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,319
heart rate monitor

00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:24,839
temperature and light push button hello

00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:28,480
led ambulance

00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:32,240
um lots of different things so

00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:34,000
in fact if we do the ambulance thing

00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,240
i'll just show you really quick before i

00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,280
stop sharing this

00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,280
this has uh

00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:49,839
the ambulance basically uses the

00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:53,520
um let's say that we do the 30 leds

00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:58,640
on pin 2 and then attach

00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:58,640
the buzzer i think is on pin zero

00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,440
and let's see if we can play that so

00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,280
this the red blocks are basically

00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,520
setting it up as a web thing

00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,730
and then i have button a to toggle it on

00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:11,280
and off

00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:16,640
[Music]

00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:16,640
so this is my little ambulance

00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:22,559
and then talk about it and so this

00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:26,000
actually works as a web thing

00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:30,800
and i will stop sharing

00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:33,520
that okay

00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,079
yeah you have a few questions you can

00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,559
reply

00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:38,240
to them in the sharing notes on the left

00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:41,359
side of the screen

00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:43,599
okay let's see maybe

00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:46,240
a few minutes if you can alright so in

00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:48,160
the main remaining minutes

00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:51,599
let me go over to the chat window is

00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:54,960
that where i'm supposed to be

00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,960
yes sort of notes

00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:02,319
no public chat or just shared notes

00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,319
notes

00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:06,640
yes right now questions for me okay tour

00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,559
of my

00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:11,760
that is have you written documentations

00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:15,520
or reviews of these different systems

00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,640
not really um you know documentation

00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,640
there is a wiki

00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,160
or web things project will take you to

00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,559
the wiki and there's some documentation

00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:25,599
about

00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:25,599
devices we know to work and uh

00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,720
my my base recommendation is is

00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,319
look up some of the information if it's

00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,760
a wi-fi device you have to be very

00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:35,920
careful about whether or not it's

00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,720
getting out to the internet or not

00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:40,640
and block it but zigbee or z-wave

00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:43,839
devices or anything that's non-ip

00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:45,200
is is going to be good and then

00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:46,800
look at the add-ons because they will

00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,400
tell you a lot of information about the

00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,800
different devices

00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,559
is there any major implication when ipv6

00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:55,359
becomes standard in terms of security

00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,359
embedded systems

00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:59,119
again in ipv6 you're going to have to

00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,400
treat it just like wi-fi or anything

00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:02,720
that has an internet

00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,480
accessible protocol then you have to

00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,240
know that you're blocking that proto

00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,920
you're blocking that device from the

00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:11,920
internet or not

00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:13,920
and uh i think in future versions of the

00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:16,000
web things there's one guy that set up

00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,920
the raspberry pi gateway as the access

00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,880
point so all the wi-fi devices connect

00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,559
to it

00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,880
and then he has an add-on that basically

00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:23,920
blocks them unless he wants them to talk

00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,599
to the internet

00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,119
you know there are future applications

00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:28,400
where you have an appliance and

00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:30,480
something breaks

00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,599
you want the appliance manufacturer to

00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,520
be able to

00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:34,960
remotely check the information but it's

00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:37,760
something you just want to turn on

00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,720
for the time of that you know remote

00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,720
service call

00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:42,160
not always monitoring what you're

00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:45,839
washing in your washing machine

00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:47,359
right and um

00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:49,040
and so it really depends on the

00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:50,319
protocols to investigate that what's

00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:53,359
your opinion

00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:56,079
for is tor hidden service the perfect

00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:58,160
tool for exposing iot home servers

00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:59,359
so the current encrypted channel that

00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:02,960
i'm using is

00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:05,839
it's called it's page kite and so it is

00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,440
tunneled just to me https only for my

00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:08,000
username so i'm fairly confident with

00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,000
that

00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,520
but it does have a cost and right now

00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,200
that cost is being beared

00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,960
by volunteers and we're trying to turn

00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,920
it into a non-profit that can cover

00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,800
those costs

00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,119
there's another um tunneling service

00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,520
called

00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:22,800
nkn which is a blockchain distributed

00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,480
service and we're

00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,839
and that does work also but it's a

00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,359
little cumbersome to set up so i'm

00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:29,119
hoping we can add an add-on that you

00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:32,319
could use the n-can tunneling

00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:33,040
or you can just you know you can open a

00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:35,119
port

00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,240
um through your own broadband service

00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:38,960
provider

00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:41,359
uh you just have to be very has access

00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:44,720
to get into that port

00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:47,440
um let's see besides encrypted channel

00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:49,599
only you know the service

00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,720
automatically hacking attacks simply

00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,079
don't know where

00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,839
is your exposed server no one should

00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:55,359
know you have a smart home right

00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:57,359
yeah i totally agree the smart home

00:54:55,359 --> 00:55:00,240
privacy to me is a

00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:02,160
very important and what worries me about

00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:04,400
what worries me most about these

00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,000
centralized service providers having

00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,319
access to all our smart home data is

00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,200
like

00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:11,119
one hack exposes millions of homes at

00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,960
least in the case of decentralization

00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:14,559
where each of our homes is a data center

00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,280
they have to hack into one home at a

00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:16,960
time just like

00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,680
physically they'd have to hack into one

00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:22,319
home at a time and if you're in russia

00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,280
you know physically accessing my home is

00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:27,359
pretty hard

00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:29,599
and uh but remote access is is easier

00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:32,079
um so i just have to maintain that

00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:33,119
security of https from the outside as

00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:37,040
the only way to have

00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:39,599
to get in are there iot devices talking

00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:42,160
in a proprietary program call

00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:43,040
well yeah so though how does web of

00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:45,920
things deal with it

00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:48,240
any wireless protocol or messaging

00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:51,200
protocol that's proprietary is fine

00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:52,079
as long as at some point there's an api

00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:55,440
that's

00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:58,079
exposed or can be um you know

00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:00,240
reverse engineered into getting those

00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:03,440
data now there are some that are like

00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:05,119
nest which is like a secure pipe from

00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,000
the device to the internet the nest

00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:08,079
internet and back

00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,319
you can't tap into it there's no nest

00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:13,760
add-on because nest does not expose

00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:15,359
any information locally and

00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,440
it's a real pain to get it from the

00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:20,640
cloud

00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,680
um what are your opinions of the home

00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:24,720
assistant project

00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:27,359
so i've i've built one

00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:29,040
it wasn't hard to spin up but i found

00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:30,799
that

00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:33,280
i didn't spend a lot of time of it on it

00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:35,359
because it requires all these like

00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,640
tomml configuration files and i really

00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:38,160
felt like

00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,839
the web things is something i could set

00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:42,880
up in my mom's home and my

00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:45,119
cousins and my friends and family

00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:47,200
and it really doesn't require any

00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:49,440
configuration files that

00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,799
are difficult like they can then learn

00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,559
just the add-on

00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:54,079
config file it's just a web page and

00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:55,680
they don't have to learn special things

00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:58,079
so for home assistant

00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:00,160
it's great for there's a lot of

00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,760
flexibility for developers but not a lot

00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:05,040
of flexibility for

00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:07,040
non-tech people is mine

00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,799
my sense maybe it's improved since i

00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:11,680
last tried

00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:12,079
and then data explosion do you think

00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,799
that

00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:16,559
quote data explosion happens when we

00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:18,079
save this data typically in a cloud

00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:21,520
should our devices be more

00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:23,440
forgetful yes absolutely i would like to

00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:26,480
add something to this question

00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,520
i saw i saw a little bit earlier the the

00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,799
detail

00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:35,359
of of the data logs in some in one of

00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:38,640
your slides and in the perspective of a

00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:40,000
non-technical user uh that is a huge

00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:43,280
amount of data that is being

00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:46,480
saved i'm not using if in a cloud

00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:49,359
or in our laptops or something like that

00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:51,599
uh what will be your opinion about all

00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:56,079
these concerns about privacy and

00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:59,520
that the leakage and uh right right

00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:01,760
being sold in like mine yeah i i don't

00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,799
want my data saved over time i have a

00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,359
seven day

00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:06,960
rolling window that where the data just

00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:10,079
purges and rolls off

00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:12,559
there is like an influx db uh add-on so

00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:14,160
if if you're an industrial setting or a

00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:16,640
you know commercial setting you might

00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:20,400
want to store data but you might want to

00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:23,359
do it as a um what are those uh

00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:25,280
rdb the the sort of where it crunches

00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:27,119
the data the older it gets

00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,040
might be a way to log it i personally

00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:30,799
for smart home use i think you should

00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:33,599
throw it away unless there's some real

00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:35,920
good reason to to keep track of it

00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:37,280
and someone else wrote an add-on time in

00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,760
in the netherlands where you can

00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,520
actually

00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,599
set up periods of time where it's not

00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,040
logging data from a privacy standpoint

00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:44,799
like when my house

00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,480
keeping service is home i don't want to

00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:48,079
keep track of everything while they're

00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,640
in here and so i just have it not

00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:50,880
logging

00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:53,839
during those times and so i think we

00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:56,400
really need to enable consumers to

00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:56,960
keep very careful track of what is being

00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,520
logged

00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,160
and the privacy implications there's a

00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:03,200
lot of

00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:04,640
things to be done absolutely thank you

00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,240
and then what other cloud services can

00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,640
we use other than google cloud to

00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:10,160
potentiate the features and usability

00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,319
oh well i don't think we need to use

00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:14,000
commercial clouds at all in my case

00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:15,520
you know i think we should all be our

00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,119
own clouds

00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:21,680
and uh run things locally

00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:23,760
and other online services even if you

00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,880
trust the vendor of it the vendor can

00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,200
get hacked as well

00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,799
so you have to be careful is there a way

00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,240
to set up a secondary pie to take over

00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:32,480
in case the main one will fail

00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,359
yeah it's as easy as just backing up

00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,559
this this

00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:38,000
certain um web things i o directory i

00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:39,920
back that up periodically

00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,200
and then you can just bring up a brand

00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,119
new pie and just

00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,240
upload that directory and your whole pie

00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:47,599
is back to normal

00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:49,280
so um there's also satellites that

00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:51,040
someone has done for the voice control

00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,040
so you can have satellite voice control

00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:55,040
in different rooms

00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,319
any hardware kit already pre-installed

00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:59,839
yes okay do

00:59:56,319 --> 01:00:02,720
actually has um okdo.com has a web

00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:05,119
things gateway raspberry pi 4 kit

01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,640
uh but it's only the raspberry pi part

01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:09,119
um

01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:10,559
and then on top of that i would just get

01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:12,319
a zigbee

01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:15,040
adapter and a bunch of zigbee devices

01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:17,040
you can buy from my ikea or anything

01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:19,599
can you show add-on for a cat we use

01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:22,000
microblocks to write it

01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:23,119
i don't have to time to show a cat and i

01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,160
don't know what you wanted

01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:28,720
exactly but microblocks for writing

01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:30,079
your own iot devices is really cool is

01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:32,640
super fun

01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,440
uh i highly encourage people to play

01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:36,240
around with it

01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:37,440
and there's a wiki on microblocks that

01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:39,119
has

01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,280
a little information about how to set up

01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:43,440
the raspberry pi gateway and then

01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,319
a few basic web things applications you

01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,680
can write with it

01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:49,839
so um sorry i

01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:51,119
blabbed too much and ran out of my time

01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:55,440
but uh

01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:55,440
