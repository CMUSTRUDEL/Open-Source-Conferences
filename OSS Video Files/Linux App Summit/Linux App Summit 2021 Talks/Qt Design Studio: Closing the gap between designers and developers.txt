Publication date: 2021-05-30
Playlist: Linux App Summit 2021 Talks
Description: 
	Qt is a framework for creating graphical user interfaces as well as cross-platform applications that run on various software and hardware platforms such as Linux, Windows, macOS, Android or embedded systems with little or no change in the underlying codebase. Qt is well known for its usage by the KDE and Open-Source applications like Krita.
QML, a user interface markup language, is part of the Qt framework. QML is a declarative language (like CSS and JSON). Qt Quick is the name of the QML based framework for defining modern user interfaces.
To break the cycle of painstaking feedback loops between designers and developers the Qt Company is also developing Qt Design Studio a graphical editor for Qt Quick and QML. Qt Design Studio comes also as a free community version for non-commercial users and is available for Linux.
This talk is showing how Qt Design Studio with Qt and QtQuick can be used to create Linux apps with a modern user interface and how to involve UX designers in the development process.
