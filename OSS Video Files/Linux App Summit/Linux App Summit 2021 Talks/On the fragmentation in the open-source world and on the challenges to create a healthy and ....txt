Description: 
	On the fragmentation in the open-source world and on the challenges to create a healthy and sustainable project maintanence.



Many open source projects fail to create a sustainable setup and constant and healthy growth, to adopt to new needs and changes and to survive over many years. Limited amount of time and human resources is usually the major factor for this. In this presentation we're going to talk about the fragmentation of resources in the area of applications for interactive analysis and visualization of scientific data (LabPlot, SciDAVis, Veusz, Kst, AlphaPlot, etc.), challenges caused by this and how we're trying to overcome them now at LabPlot.

	00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,040
so hello everybody my name is alexander

00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,879
zemke i'm one of the uh

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,720
developers maintenance of the project

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,440
called laplace i'm going to talk about

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,639
this

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,440
project um soon and the title of my talk

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,360
is

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,119
on the fragmentation in the open source

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,400
world and the challenges

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:24,000
um caused by this

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,119
with respect to the maintenance of

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,760
such projects so let me start with so

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:35,520
let me see how to navigate here

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,160
okay so let me start with some general

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,160
um statements and consideration so open

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,440
source community open source movement so

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,879
many people associate

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,800
uh immediately automatically

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,160
contribution of millions of

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,039
volunteers many many people across the

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,320
whole world

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:56,160
working having the same or similar

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,160
mindset ideas and

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,320
ideas a vision about how to develop the

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,680
software how to distribute it how to

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,680
make it available

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,439
for the society so there's a big amount

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,520
of manpower across

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,520
the whole world contributing to this

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,280
movement so while this is of course true

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,280
for the whole movement in general

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,640
this is not necessarily true if you go

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,560
down to the level of

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,799
every single project so we have many

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,320
projects with a lot of manpower

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:25,600
and we have projects uh um struggling

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,040
to to maintain maintain the project in

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,560
the long term

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,479
so there are different challenges for

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,040
different projects of different sizes

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,479
and this

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,320
like big projects have different

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,560
problems compared to

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,159
challenges you have if you maintain a

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,360
smaller project and there's for sure and

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,680
overlap between

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,759
between these challenges and um so

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,159
there's one important aspect of one spot

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,360
important factor that is uh more

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,720
critical

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,880
for smaller projects

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,479
okay so in in general so if i talk about

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,640
small project it doesn't mean

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,759
we are talking about a trivial trivial

00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,600
approach to providing

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,439
some trivial functionality so if i talk

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,159
about small or big project i always

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,640
refer

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,600
to the amount of manpower available in

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,360
this project

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,720
so the human factor human factor related

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,040
to the amount of manpower

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,760
is more critical for small approaches so

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,200
let me quickly

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,440
let me spend some time talking about

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,520
this

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,520
so what many people what many you think

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,840
or assume usually is okay so there's a

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,239
project i'm using there's an application

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,920
freely available and if i have some

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,120
future requests or if i have some bug

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,280
reports so i

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,040
report this and then there's this

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,200
expectation okay so that people

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,720
behind this project will take care of

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,840
this they will provide implement this

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,840
new feature that

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,599
will work out the fix will provide the

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,720
next update and so on and so on and goes

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,400
like this

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,080
more or less forever okay while i'm

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,760
using this project so they're always

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,640
well i'm using this application there

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,319
always people behind this portrait who

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,160
will make sure you know this is this

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,959
project is still alive and what people

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,440
don't understand

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,080
not always understand is maybe you know

00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,840
the

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,599
developers and maintenance behind this

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,680
project are human

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,720
beings too so most of us are working in

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,280
this portion in

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,280
our free time spare time and um

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,480
it's getting more and more hard as if

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,920
you approach it gets bigger and bigger

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,560
again it's bigger with respect to the

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,000
features

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,680
so it's getting harder and harder for

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,360
you to maintain such a project

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,360
so you have a limited amount of time at

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,360
some point in time

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,720
maintaining such a project becomes

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,360
becomes a work for you

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,000
so it's not it starts maybe as a fund as

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,159
a pet

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,440
hobby project okay and results in

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,799
additional additional

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,080
work for you so you're getting more and

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,799
more professional maybe with your

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,280
project

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,120
and this basically adds on top of the

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,120
usual stress you have in your life

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,799
so it's getting harder and harder and

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,560
then people also can have personal

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,239
interests and motivations

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,040
that change over time so people can

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,959
decide to stop working on this project

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,640
okay and if you don't make sure that

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,920
make sure there's somebody who can pick

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,000
up the work you

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,760
did before if there's nobody else who

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,159
can continue working on this

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,400
the project is more or less done okay so

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,680
this situation is very very critical for

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,319
for this smaller project where we don't

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,080
have enough people to attach to

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,720
so because of this reason so it's very

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,200
very hard for these small projects to

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,040
safeguard their maintenance to really be

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,560
reliability of the project in the long

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,560
run

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,160
and uh what many so it is also my

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,400
personal impression so many

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,000
developers in this open source community

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,080
heavily underestimate

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,040
the import uh the importance of the

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,960
invest in the

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,360
long-term maintenance and i will talk

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,160
about a couple of examples

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,840
on the next slides so one important

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,120
problem or one important aspect here in

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,440
this discussion is the

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,960
fragmentation of resources or lack of

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,000
collaboration between the different

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,680
people

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,120
are working on similar projects so

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,040
instead of working together

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,800
let's say working together on the same

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,720
same approach you combine

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,280
combine the available resources that are

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,600
spare anyway you know people um

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,040
prefer to work on their uber projects

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,800
and this is maybe successful for a

00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,440
couple of years but then because of the

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,360
reasons

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,039
mentioned above you don't manage to

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,240
continue working anymore on this project

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,199
you stop doing this

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,880
and this is clearly not a healthy

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,800
healthy sustainable situation for your

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,759
project

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,000
so i would like to um make these

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,800
statements now more precise to quantify

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,520
them a bit and i would like to do so

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,520
by using um the examples by using the

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,880
project i'm working on and by using

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,880
the examples for a couple of other

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,120
projects that are similar

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,440
to our project so the project i'm

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,440
working on is called laptop laptop

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,039
so for those who don't know this

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,759
application very quick introduction

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,320
about it

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,440
so laplate is a kde application for

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,080
interactive

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,880
graphic and analysis of scientific data

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,800
so this is

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,919
just to get your brief introduction so

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,320
you get an impression

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,240
about what this kind of application can

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,960
do for you

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,880
um so this is application following the

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,000
the graphical user interface

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,600
approach um you can import the data into

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,440
this application we support multiple

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,919
performance like ascii binary

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,080
multi-dimensional formats like html5

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,600
feeds and so on and so on so you import

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,479
this data in the application and

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,600
you can prepare visualization fruit so

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:16,240
we also support um

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,759
live data meaning so you have data

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,800
located in somewhere in the heart disc

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,759
or coming

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,400
over the network um from local network

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,080
sockets mqtt or from serial port and

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,600
then we basically connect to this data

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,400
sources and

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,840
application visualize visualize the data

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,639
for you on every

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,319
data update basically so right now we

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,680
support only 3d two-dimensional

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,840
visualization

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,120
and on top of the visualization we

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,520
provide also

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,319
multiple what we call analysis functions

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,160
okay analysis functions this can be

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,240
sorry this can be either feeling

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,360
smoothing phosphoryl transformation

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,800
interpolation integration

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,039
differentiation of your data

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,000
and so on and so on so it also provides

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,319
some basic uh

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,160
statistical capabilities this is

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,039
actually something an area where we plan

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,319
to

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:07,039
add much more near future

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,039
so we also support access to multiple to

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,199
different open source computer algebra

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,880
systems being maxima octave

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,479
r or also to dynamic script languages

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,160
like python

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,800
and julia so with this we basically

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,800
allow allow to access a huge amount a

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,680
very very powerful set of features

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,039
provided by these systems and once you

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,280
are done with your analysis of data

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,440
visualization so you can export

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,599
the results if needed to multiple to

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,479
different formats and you can embed them

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,160
in your publication and so on and so on

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,240
okay so this is a very brief overview of

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,199
the feature settings so if you want to

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,919
need if you want to see more visit our

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,240
webpage

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,599
so here a couple of screenshots so here

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,560
you see a typical

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:53,759
session of flat plot this is the main

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,400
window on the left hand side you see the

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,479
we see the what we call project explorer

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,960
where all the

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,720
objects you created in this project are

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,680
shown and then you basically click with

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,039
the mouse

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,960
uh select object uh you get it you get

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,720
the content of this object basically

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,639
shown in the middle area the main area

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,919
of the application on the right hand

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,400
side you can modify

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,240
all the properties of the selected

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,960
options so in this specific case some

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,800
data some some

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,560
experimental data was imported in the

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,360
application then we perform a

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,160
feed by using a certain mathematical

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,159
function we perform a fit to this

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,599
measured data okay so this is how this

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,719
application looks like and then you can

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,000
once you are done

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,240
you you you can export the results

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,399
so here another example of uh what you

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,800
can do with laplace here we are plotting

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,680
uh

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,399
uh we are visualizing uh mathematical

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,120
function

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,040
defined um a certain parametrization

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,519
okay this is the so-called

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,560
butterfly curve very very nice example

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,680
and i wanted to use it here to show here

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,160
um in this session too

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,160
so i mentioned the access to uh multiple

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,880
computer algebra system and this is how

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,399
it looks like

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,600
so what you see here on the left hand

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:12,560
side is a notebook

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,480
using maxima maxima is a well-known open

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,800
source computer ultra processing maybe

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,959
the

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:21,120
most most powerful one in this area and

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,959
of course it's also possible to do

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,800
visualization in this computer algebra

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,160
systems okay but our approach is

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,920
basically we do

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,080
the calculation inside of such a

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,120
computer algebra system session

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,680
and we

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,760
provide the exposed data the results of

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,480
this calculations we expose this to the

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,519
laplace

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,920
run time and then we basically can

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,720
visualize visualize the produced data

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,920
the results

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,000
by using our graphical interface

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,680
okay and this specific example uh

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,360
duffing oscillator

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,360
uh the properties of the stopping

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,480
oscillator they are calculated so this

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,480
is an

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,080
oscillator that can develop a chaotic

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,760
chaotic behavior

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,680
and then um a couple of relevant

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,360
metrics uh describing this oscillator

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,880
this is the schematic behavior

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,920
uh visualize on the right hand side

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:17,279
okay enough of that advertisement

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,160
for that plot um i hope you got an

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,279
impression about

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,320
uh what this project can do for you and

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:27,760
um well this is not the only project

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,600
um that can do

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,880
this stuff so i will introduce shortly a

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,959
couple of other projects

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,560
um so while talking about when talking

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,560
about fragmentation

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:40,399
fragmentation of resources and

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,920
the amount of manpower you have attached

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,240
to every single project so

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,079
somehow we need to quantify this and i

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,680
would like to quantify this by

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:52,079
using the uh git the commit statistics

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,240
so here i extracted the statistics from

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,320
github for our approach again for

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,839
for the next projects i'm going to show

00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,760
soon

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,519
so what you see here is the history of

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,200
laplace in the last

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,440
um 10 12 years

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,079
okay so you see so the first two top

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,720
contributors so those are the

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,279
basically the two core maintenance of

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,120
this

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:19,040
project and we see the number of commits

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,959
every day or every week whatever

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,040
sampling is used here right now

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,000
so you see a constant constant active

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,399
work done over

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,440
multiple multiple years but again so

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,399
only two

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,360
core developers right now so we have a

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,600
couple of other guys

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,880
i'm showing here so those are our

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,480
students so we are

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,399
participating in a google summer of

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,079
course for multiple years already we try

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,399
to attract new

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,160
new contributors new students and by

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,720
utilizing basically this

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,600
program so what you see here are our

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,079
students

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,279
so this guy actually um i mentored him a

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,079
couple of years ago

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,800
and then about two years later he became

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,839
um

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,360
became a cheeser mentor too okay so this

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,920
was kind of a success

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,800
story for us we managed to enable one

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,440
person and

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,760
um this person continued contributing to

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,760
the project even after jesus project was

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,079
his project was finalized okay so this

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,120
guy was mentoring this guys couple of

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,720
years later so he disappeared then for

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,760
one two three years because

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,440
he need university uh was over he was

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,040
somebody in the university and then you

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,240
i mean you have your own personal life

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,000
you need to organize

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,680
a job you know you need maybe to move to

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,800
another city and so on and so on so it

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,079
took some time

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,680
for him to to finalize all the stuff so

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,200
he is now returning back started

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,000
contributing

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,360
um recently again so we have a couple of

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,120
other contributors

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,880
let me show this here again so a couple

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,480
of czech students here

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:50,079
so this guy is actually one of our users

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,800
who is quite active with respect to

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:55,360
providing generating new ideas but also

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,519
providing providing fixes and

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,360
also developing new features okay this

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,079
is of course an ideal situation when you

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,839
manage

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:07,839
to convert one of some of your users to

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,519
to to contribute us okay so you see also

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,320
this guy please remember this name you

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,120
will see

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,320
this uh name later on again so this is

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,079
one of the

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,959
translators in kde at kde okay and this

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,320
is the person

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:25,040
helping out all the time to make sure

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,880
that the translation and localization

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,320
relevant stuff is properly done in our

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,839
code

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,600
okay so this is the station for our

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,279
project again two co-developers

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,480
separating contributions from other

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,480
people and

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,760
well this is the status of this project

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,000
right now

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,120
we are not alone okay so there's similar

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,240
projects um

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,120
out there and uh let me spend some time

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,959
talking about them

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,440
so first of the projects i decided to

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,279
pick here is side data sci davis's

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,959
abbreviation standing for

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,120
scientific data analysis and

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,839
visualization so actually the history of

00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,320
this project is quite interesting one

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,120
side davis resulted as a fork of another

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,639
project

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:08,160
that went closed sourced closed source

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,079
15 years ago 20 years ago so i'm not

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,360
going to talk about this project

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,720
and the two guys who forked this project

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,839
original project

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,600
they quickly realized okay so the

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,199
code base we have right now this is

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,360
maybe not in the best shape

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,199
we would like to rewrite everything and

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,639
but this is a lot of work okay so you

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,800
quickly realized

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,160
it's going to be hard so you kind of

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,079
understand the amount of

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,680
um the number of features you would like

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,880
to provide you understand the overall

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,720
feature set um

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,000
that this kind of application needs to

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,839
provide to the users

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,199
in order to be accepted in order to have

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,760
a chance uh

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,839
out there and they quickly realized okay

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,440
we need maybe to collaborate with

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,120
somebody else they started looking

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,839
around and they

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,079
encounter found lapland okay at that

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,920
time at that point in time lap plot

00:14:54,079 --> 00:15:00,079
had this transition from q3 to q4

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,360
major reflecting major rewrite and

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,199
actually so instead of

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,519
adjusting migrating the code so we

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:08,639
decided to start from scratch

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:11,360
okay we started from scratch and

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,079
uh sky the side davis guys decided to

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,880
participate

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,399
in this so we used used uh laplace

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,560
repository we used this

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,880
uh new code where we tried to

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,800
incorporate all the experience

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,399
we had from the past every everything

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,480
that went wrong so we wanted to do

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,639
better okay so we worked together

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,680
for i don't know so maybe one year two

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,160
years

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,320
and then um so very very healthy

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,600
collaboration very active

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,959
face for all of us and then at some

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,279
point in time one of the

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,000
side davis guys decided to quit this

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,079
business

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,160
so he became demotivated

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,160
he had other activities in his life

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,680
updated the motivation change interest

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,000
changed and he also he became

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,800
demotivated because of the

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,360
amount of work you need to do to invest

00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,199
here

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,199
to get the project to a level where you

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,399
would like to have it okay you can as i

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,600
mentioned before so

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,680
the overall scope of such a project is

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,360
very very clear for all the people

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,360
working on this process so most of us

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,560
have academical background so

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,240
during our university time phd times you

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,079
know we worked obviously working with

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,360
this kind of application so you kind of

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,759
know

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,519
the overall feature set okay now you

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,560
start implementing the features and you

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,800
extrapolate

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,920
extrapolate to the level uh what you

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,800
would like to see

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,639
for your program you can you can uh

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,959
estimate the amount of time you need

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,560
here

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,000
okay and this was one of the reasons for

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,399
this guy to quit so he said

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,160
no i mean it's not it's taking too long

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,000
of my time too much of my time

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,759
it will take too long for all of us to

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,480
become successful i don't want to do

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,639
this anymore

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,560
okay so he created this business and a

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,480
couple of months

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,759
later the second developer of society

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,079
was disappeared

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,199
so the second guy didn't even notify us

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,199
on

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,720
on the mailing list so there was no

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,720
personal email sent

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,399
he simply disappeared okay not clear not

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,439
clear what happened to him

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:08,240
and um well at this point in time so

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,760
uh psy davis was quite popular on

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,600
sourceforge popular with

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,600
uh in the sense of you know so the

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,000
number of downloads for this project

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,280
per month was very very high and so on

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,439
forge didn't want

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,439
this project to die because of its

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,959
success okay and then um

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,799
sourceforge um did some advertisement on

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,880
their homepage so this day

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,840
they started looking for another

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,679
maintainer

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,760
for this project and there was one guy

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,960
who decided to take over the maintenance

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,600
here so that they

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,360
joined this program this project took

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,960
over basically everything

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,280
and um yeah so he became basically the

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,880
maintain of this project

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,559
a couple of months after this we reached

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,000
out to this and there was maybe one two

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,600
or three other guys who

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,200
started working on this project too

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,080
because of all this advertisement and

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,840
noise

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,120
did by sourceforge so there were

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,280
multiple people who

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,039
took over the work so we reached out to

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,400
them and asked for collaboration and

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,240
asked to continue the

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,080
the successful and very productive

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,640
collaboration we had with the original

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,679
throughout this authors of this project

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,880
and um

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,039
they didn't show too much of the

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,919
interest okay so for them i mean

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,360
they were struggling with the overall

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,559
amount of code in the future

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,600
said set of side davis anyway and it was

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:26,480
hard for them

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:28,880
to move on now to yet another project

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,760
um well so the project i think is still

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,280
alive but uh

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,960
doesn't have any any big development of

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,280
new features so there's more or less

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,520
maintenance work so keeping keeping

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,120
alive what was created in the last

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,400
years and uh yes so maintenance is still

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,360
done but no

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,760
major major development done anymore and

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,520
um

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,840
what you see here so there was there was

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,400
some activity done by another user

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,520
and so this guy also disappeared here

00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,840
2016 so there was another guy who

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,039
started contributing here and was not

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,919
quite happy with the

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:06,160
uh overall architecture of this court so

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,880
he decided to this

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,160
okay like one of the problems um in the

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,799
open source community

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,600
so you you um don't talk to each other

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,600
you

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,520
 the project okay i'm not saying

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,200
this is always the case but this

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,799
happens from time to time so this guy

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,000
 uh

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:26,240
uh front side davis and created alpha

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,480
plot okay so this is now a screenshot

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,960
and the statement the description from

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,240
from this uh from from from the home

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,799
page of this project

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,880
so this is how a typical uh session

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,160
looks like inside dave's an alpha plot

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,559
so they looked they have

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,640
more or less the same feature set and

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,600
what is being done you know what was

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,640
done here basically this guy decided to

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,480
move to another

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,679
floating library here so instead of

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,440
using the code

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,039
the old library that was used by side

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,960
davis he wanted to use

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,559
something that is more modern providing

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,080
more features and having more

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,240
maintenance and so on and so on

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,440
okay this is basically refactoring done

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,679
by the sky here

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,960
and then adding more new features again

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,440
similar situation here

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,200
so quite some excitement and activity at

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,240
the beginning

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,080
and this is what i uh um

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,919
always referring to so it's very very

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,840
soft uh very very easy to start a

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,520
project okay so you're very motivated

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,600
you're eager to develop something it's

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,159
very easy very easy to do the first

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,720
steps

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,159
um during this development during this

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,400
excitement phase okay

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,000
but then at some point in time you run

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,080
into this situation

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,120
phase where it's not so easy anymore to

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,799
do the next steps

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,120
okay you have technical challenges you

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,799
get challenges

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,400
because of your personal life because of

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,840
the limited amount of time and so on and

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,760
so on so all these factors

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,120
i described in the beginning so you run

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,640
basically into these problems

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,080
at some point in time okay and this is

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,159
what we see here so after this

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,559
excitement phase after this very

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,640
active development phase it went down so

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,320
there was no nothing done anymore

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,000
and then you see these different phases

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,120
you know where this

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,600
one single person finds where this

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,159
person finds some time to contribute to

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,360
okay so big breaks in the development of

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,960
this project there

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,559
again some some live shown here and

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,159
but more or less you know so one man

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:19,120
project two no

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:20,960
further contribution from other people

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,200
um so there's one more project to

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,720
mention here so this is called views

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,360
um i would say you know out of this

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,880
project

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,720
i mentioned here this is maybe the

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,360
project with the biggest

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,919
amount of feature sets said having also

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,120
the

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:39,840
longest history here maybe um

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,480
also more or less a one-time project

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,559
okay this is a guy from academia

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,039
who apparently has enough time to

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:49,120
continue working on this

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,720
on this project working on this project

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,080
already for many many years so the

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,440
project was still active still

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,200
maintained and

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,840
um a couple of years ago so i reached

00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,799
out to this guy and asked for

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,320
collaboration like you know so we are

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:04,159
working on the same

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,600
same um functionality we are using cube

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,440
you know so there's a lot of

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,039
a lot of stuff maybe to be shared so

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,600
let's come together let's work together

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:14,000
on something that is much much bigger

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,919
than compared to what we have uh right

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,159
now in our approaches like working

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,760
alone on them so this guy didn't show

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,640
too much of the interest you know and

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,520
then he

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,080
went different ways separate ways uh

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,360
again

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,760
and continue working on our projects

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,480
alone so also here you see so this is

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,240
more or less

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,240
one one-man project

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:43,280
so one more project to mention here

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,880
it's actually another project from the

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,000
kde community it's

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,679
called case team so this is uh

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,640
also a project having a very long

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:55,039
history and this project is known for

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,080
for its speed okay so the setting i took

00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,039
here is

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,200
from their home page and you see here

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,600
typical session there's some live data

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,679
is visualized so incoming data and high

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,159
frequency

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,600
is visualized and then certain analysis

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,200
functions like smoothing maybe is

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,840
applied you know and then you get

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,880
basically

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,200
this kind of visualization so let's

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,440
check

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,400
let's check the activity the activity

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,400
for this project too

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,120
so over here more or less the same

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,440
situation we have one to two developers

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,640
contributing to this project so one one

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,000
developer who

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:35,600
managed to work for a substantial amount

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,200
of time um managed to contribute to this

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:41,760
project and he more or less disappeared

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,919
um two years ago okay so right now

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,880
there's nobody else who can pick up this

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,120
project

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,120
so there are many or there are several

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:53,520
several emails sent to the mailing

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:56,000
list users asking for

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,159
updates for some maintenance related

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,919
work for new builds for windows for new

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,559
versions of windows and so on and so on

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:05,200
again there's more as nobody who can

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,000
reply who can take over the world that

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,000
was done

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,240
by disguise here okay there was another

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,559
guy who was quite active

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,080
who has his active face disappeared

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:17,200
completely too

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:21,840
okay so right now this project is not um

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,840
i would say not alive anymore

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,039
okay as a short summary maybe so what

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,039
you see here so for this kind of

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:32,240
applications we see a

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:35,200
very fragmented distribution of

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,320
development resources so we see mostly

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,799
one to

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,159
two main projects and these different

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,760
approaches have different

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:45,440
speed of development for laplace i would

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,159
say right now we have a

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,679
very very active very healthy

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,760
development phase so these two

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,880
developers including miso they showed

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,120
before

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,520
are working very well together so very

00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,320
it's a lot of fun developing working

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,520
together yes would be i would say very

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,600
very productive very

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,360
very effective right now so there are no

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,799
bigger discussions so we are highly

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,559
aligned um

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,840
very productive mode right now no

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:13,279
conflict uh

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,159
conflicts but it's clear you know this

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,320
won't go

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,080
on forever because of the reasons i

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,720
mentioned in the beginning so we still

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,320
need to

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,480
think about what to do how to do the

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,080
project setup properly so we don't run

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,159
into this situation

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,080
like for a couple of other projects i

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,080
showed before

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,840
and also right now so even being very

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,039
effective very productive we are still

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,240
very limited

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,960
um with respect to our to our time okay

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,799
so

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,880
we know what as i mentioned before so we

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,480
know we know very well

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,320
what needs to be done but we need to

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,880
develop what our users are expecting

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,600
from us

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,559
also either by comparing ourselves with

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,400
other

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,919
similar open source projects or even

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,159
with commercial approaches

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,279
that have a very very big feature set so

00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,200
we know pretty much

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,120
what needs to be done here okay and then

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,760
we again kind of extrapolate the amount

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,520
of time

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,120
we would need here and then we realized

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,279
okay this will take us

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,120
years and years many many years to get

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,080
to this level okay so somehow we would

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,559
like to

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,480
speed up speed up this development so

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,200
being effective being productive

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,880
is not is not enough here so the amount

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,360
of manpower we have here is

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,159
uh not enough to do the next step so we

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,240
would like to

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,400
bring the project to uh to the next

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,799
level and having the other

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,440
resources available right now is maybe

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,440
not enough

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,120
so we would like to change this current

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,720
situation so these challenges

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,400
i mentioned before so we would like to

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,279
address them somehow so we want to do

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,799
the next step in the development

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:44,320
of the project and we want to

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,640
make sure you know so we have this

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,480
healthy situation in the project going

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,000
on for many many

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,760
years near future in future

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,520
so what we are doing what we are doing

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,159
here right now so we are we are looking

00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,480
for

00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,320
synergies and collaboration with other

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,240
projects so with other projects so i'm

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,159
not referring anymore to the

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,760
projects i mentioned before because here

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,960
the situation is clear so they are

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,600
either not active

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,120
anymore or we already reached out to

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,880
them there was no big interest to

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,840
collaborate okay so i don't think so we

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,840
are going

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,600
we are going to reach out to these guys

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,960
again so we are looking here basically

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,880
for

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,799
uh for other projects or for other

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,799
frameworks libraries

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,799
that we can utilize that we can use in

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,679
our application and it would help us to

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,799
speed up

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,559
basically the development of the project

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,799
so we also would like to intensify the

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,080
activities within our within kde within

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,480
our organization so those

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,480
activities are basically around around

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,880
packaging of the software distributing

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,679
it

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,520
through various uh app stores like

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,440
microsoft store

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,000
apple store and so on and so on so we

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,120
have um

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,399
um we would like oba over here

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,080
making more use of the artifacts built

00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,399
artifacts produced on the build

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,840
and for subject kde lake and also this

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,000
installer provide nightly

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,760
installer nightly build to this

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,679
installer provided for windows station

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,399
image provide for mac os

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,480
users and we do a bit more advertisement

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,320
around these build artifacts we invite

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,080
users to test to use overnight labels

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,559
not only on linux where the dissipation

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,399
is

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:22,320
clear right so we also want to attract

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,480
so we realized actually so we have many

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,200
many users uh coming from the windows

00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,039
world and we don't want to block them

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,559
don't want to completely ignore them

00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,720
and now we are also inviting more and

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,840
more of these users to

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,520
test to test their nightly builds okay

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,360
and the results for this are produced on

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,120
the centrally available infrastructure

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,880
kde

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,880
so we also also the documentation we

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,559
have right now this is definitely

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,399
something that is not on the level where

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,000
we would like to have it and

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,520
also here so we are looking for some

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:57,520
synergies collaboration

00:28:51,520 --> 00:29:00,720
within the kde kde ke organization

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,880
um yes maybe i

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,559
i i would like to make a short pause

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,760
here so i mentioned the infrastructure

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:09,360
infrastructure

00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:11,039
building infrastructure and

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,520
so there are many many people working

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:16,799
behind the scenes contributing

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:19,039
to the success of our project or to

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,440
to the success of other projects at ada

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,960
kde so people are taking care of

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,960
of the build infrastructure people

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,520
taking care of the promotional

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,480
documentation translation localization

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,159
of

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,840
of the application and so on and so on

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,360
you know so these people are usually not

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,480
the frontman

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,399
of the project so they are not visible

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,679
in many many cases okay but they are

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,880
definitely there and they're

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,720
contributing

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,240
a lot a lot to the success of this

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,200
fortune and i think so all these guys

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,440

deserve a lot of appreciation so let me

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,520
use maybe this opportunity to thank

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,440
all these people working in these areas

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,120
um so i really appreciate it i

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,919
appreciate the help okay see what you're

00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,840
doing here so

00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,039
ben yuri paul um carls and many many

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,840
others uh doing their

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,120
work behind the scenes thank you a lot

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,279
same of course for the

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,960
for the organizers of this event so

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:12,720
alice and other people so

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,440
thank you a lot so to improve to improve

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,120
the overall the

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,120
current situation right now so we also

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,640
plan to increase the frequency of

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,679
freelancers so this is one of the

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,559
problems

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,279
we have right now baby don't uh didn't

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,440
pay enough

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:28,559
attention maybe in the past so the

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:32,000
release when we consider

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:35,200
um and we consider the current

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,840
new feature set to be big enough and

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,559
so there are no regular regular releases

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,600
right now

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:43,440
so we do a release um once per year

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,960
so less than a year maybe and this is

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,240
something that we definitely need to

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:51,520
change so we

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:53,520
are releasing a big bunches and um

00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,360
we should do this a different sufficient

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,760
release more frequently

00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,799
and uh because you know releasing

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,240
releasing getting

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,480
getting additional attention to your

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,399
projects anyway

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,840
so and you want to invest more into the

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,720
promotion work to attract new

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,039
contributors

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,080
so having not enough resources not

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,600
enough contributors

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,360
is a challenge for this kind of

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,880
approaches for the small cautious okay

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,919
and this is definitely something

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:21,120
we need to change by by attracting new

00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,120
new people to the project

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,960
so i mentioned synergies and you know

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,080
working together collaborating with

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,799
other projects

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,559
and maybe just to give you one example

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,640
so what i'm showing here is contour

00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,240
contour is another kde application it's

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,799
a front-end for

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,320
uh front-end to different uh

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,919
mathematical applications to the

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,880
different open source computer

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,320
algebra systems like maxima octave and

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,200
so on and so on okay this is what i

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,279
mentioned in the

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,320
in the beginning and this is one of the

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,519
synergies one

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,640
of my examples i'm usually referring to

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,960
in this context

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,799
so this is where we had a big big

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,720
additional value be added um

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,399
to level because of the collaboration

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,519
between the support these two projects

00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,120
within kde

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,880
so this is now another project and

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,559
contributing to also men's

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:11,120
mentoring gzip students um so this is a

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:13,360
stand-alone application okay but what we

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,000
did basically so we embedded the runtime

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,960
we embedded

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,600
this this application into interlab plot

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,760
we

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,039
enabled this connection between the the

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,320
computational part

00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,039
of this application and the

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,559
visualization part of flat plot okay and

00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,360
then with this we basically provide

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,679
enable

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,039
completely new workflows and provide a

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,600
big additional value

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:35,200
to our application okay so this kind of

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,240
signatures this kind of collaboration

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,080
this is what we are

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,080
looking for here basically right now

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,799
i mentioned the promotional work um to

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,919
be honest

00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:50,880
um so there's a certain uh certain

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,840
um change in the mindset happening on

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,679
our side

00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,039
okay so we plan to invest more in this

00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,159
direction now and

00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,960
um i don't want to say we completely

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,960
ignored

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,399
the promotional part in the past okay

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,000
but i would say we heavily under

00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:07,760
underestimated the impact or the

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,440
importance of this promotional process

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,039
so how you have the impression or you

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,880
have this perception

00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,320
you're writing the best chord ever so

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,559
you're working on the most

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,640
coolest features you know so you're much

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,360
much better than your direct competitors

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,880
and

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,640
so all these users you're trying to

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,519
address so they will automatically come

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,559
to you

00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:29,840
okay this is kind of a

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:33,360
mindset uh we had in the past okay

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,159
and this didn't go well okay this was of

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,399
course

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,919
correct to a certain extent you can

00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,519
manage to attract certain amount of

00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,480
users okay but this is not enough and

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,799
they did manage

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,120
so following this uh strategy this

00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:48,080
philosophy we didn't manage to attract

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,799
any any new contributors okay so this is

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,120
not something

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,880
we would like to change so we invest now

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,320
we started investing

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:59,279
into into

00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,960
the documentation example tutorials and

00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,640
so on and so on so is this this is

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,799
something that was not

00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,279
uh didn't get enough attention from us

00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:10,560
in the past

00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:13,440
um we also invest now into the ux

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,280
um ux part of the application so we need

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,560
to make sure you know the application is

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,000
not only usable

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:22,000
by us but also by

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,159
many other newcomers here so actually

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,399
there was a commit on a comment on

00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,240
one of the reddit reddit articles

00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,440
published by the kde promotional team

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,119
and one of the users

00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,599
the comment was like this okay so i

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,200
installed laplace looks great so the

00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,240
screenshots on the homepage look great

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,919
but i don't see

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,919
how to visualize how to import and

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:42,159
visualize the data okay and this was

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:45,040
kind of uh

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,159
um well this was a very critical comment

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,119
at least for me you know

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,960
because you are working with this

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,800
application for many many years and

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,480
everything is very very clear to you so

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,240
you know how to import the data how to

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,760
visualize and you think you assume

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,359
everything is very very easy to

00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,839
understand and then you are confronted

00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,400
with

00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:02,400
such a statement from a you come from a

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,839
new user again and you see okay people

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,240
don't manage to

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,680
to work with your application right away

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,720
so you need additional help okay and

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,720
this is something that we need

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,760
something that we take very very

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,599
seriously and try to improve more

00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,520
overall plan is of course to attract new

00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:22,320
contributors to add

00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,839
to convert ideally we managed to convert

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,320
some users

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:28,720
of this application into contributors so

00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,200
mostly users in this community

00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,000
have their required technical background

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,320
so they have the

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,280
technical skills okay and then if these

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,599
people have

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,400
already some skills in c plus plus acute

00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,400
area

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,440
so these people of course are very very

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,280
welcome here

00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,000
and the overall goal so without putting

00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:49,599
this now very very negatively so the

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,920
idea the final goal is to make your

00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,000
yourself redundant so what do i mean by

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,000
this if some of us if one of the core

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,240
developers decides to

00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,240
quit the project okay as it was the case

00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,760
for a couple of other examples i

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,440
mentioned a couple of minutes ago

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,800
so if this person disappears for some

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,200
reasons

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,960
okay so there must be somebody somebody

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,599
else in this watching this community who

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,400
can

00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,320
step in and take over basically what you

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,400
what you what you were doing before

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,839
okay so it's like like you know so the

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,440
hard disk in your computer

00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:21,200
so if your heart this crashes and if you

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,760
don't and you don't have any backup if

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,920
you don't

00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,680
if you don't have any any possibility to

00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,320
restore your data to replace the hard

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,440
disk

00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,560
okay your system is smallest done and

00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,320
this is something that

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,240
you can also so you can also apply the

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,400
same arguments to the maintenance of

00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:39,440
such open source projects so if you want

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,079
all long if you want to have a healthy

00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,960
maintenance

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,560
for a long period of time you need to

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,720
make sure there is somebody

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,359
somebody who can take over your

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,359
activities

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,720
of course all these things mentioned

00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,800
here this additional work into the

00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,119
promotion documentation and so on and so

00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,839
on this results in additional work and

00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,599
additional

00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,359
effort for the maintenance as i

00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,720
mentioned before we also want to

00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:07,200
developers

00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,280
that need to do a lot of development we

00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,320
think we can write hardcore chords so we

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,640
need to write a

00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,680
chord that is not always trivial okay

00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,839
and then on top

00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,680
on top of this work you need to also

00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,440
work out all the other points

00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,599
mentioned above so this basically

00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,359
results in additional work and effort

00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,280
for the maintenance at least in the

00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,280
beginning until you manage to organize

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,960
addition and power here okay but uh

00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,480
without doing this additional

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,560
work without doing this additional

00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,400
effort i simply don't see

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,760
how to change the overall situation so

00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,359
as i mentioned before so right now

00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,160
healthy situation we

00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,119
continue working on the project but uh

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,560
this this

00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:47,520
um it's clear to everybody uh to all of

00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:49,200
us so this can this can go on like this

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,400
forever there will be a point in time

00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,320
where we need to create

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,480
where we need to hand over to somebody

00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,599
and then there must be somebody who can

00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,599
take over this activities

00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,800
um yeah at the end it's now about

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,640
finding a proper balance between doing

00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,160
the development work and

00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,040
finding enough time to do the

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:12,160
promotional promotional part

00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,160
of the project maintenance

00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:21,599
so the last slide in my presentation

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,520
i mentioned multiple times um you know

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,480
we have not enough time

00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,920
or having enough time is a problem it's

00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,480
a critical factor

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,520
for people contributing to to open

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,720
source projects and

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:38,000
projects having a non-trivial uh

00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:40,079
amount of features so now we need to

00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,280
invest into the promotion so having

00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,280
finding time

00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,800
for the promotional work is a bit hard

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,880
and if you find if you manage to find

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,079
some time for this so we want to be

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,680
as effective as possible okay so at the

00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,560
end it's all about uh

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,880
being more effective using the time you

00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,640
have

00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,560
and then producing the biggest output

00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,440
out of it

00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,320
so what i'm showing here are two tweets

00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,960
um

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,200
from the last year so in the past we

00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,119
only published something on our

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,720
home page when we did the release okay

00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,000
so there's a release announcement some

00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,640
new releases available

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,160
we write a big blog post introducing uh

00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,320
introducing all the new features

00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,599
available new release and this strategy

00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,560
we decided to change

00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:24,320
so now we basically report every couple

00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,240
of weeks on the current uh

00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,240
development activities so if there's a

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,240
new feature that landed in master

00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:33,280
so we introduce this you know we prepare

00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,359
a new blog post we tweet on twitter we

00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,250
with the help of the kde promotion team

00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,520
we

00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:39,119
[Music]

00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,960
distribute this information through

00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,000
multiple channels and what you see here

00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,359
on the left hand side

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,839
is uh um to be published last year where

00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:49,839
we introduced a new feature

00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:51,359
that was finalized back then so this

00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:53,119
feature was around this what we call

00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:55,440
info element okay with the help of this

00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:59,119
feature it's possible to attach

00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,640
attach um a label to your data point and

00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,440
then this label basically keeps the

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,680
position while

00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,200
zooming in zooming out and deploy doing

00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,480
different navigation here

00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,720
and then you can modify all the

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,079
properties of this uh info element okay

00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,560
so this kind of

00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,800
feature was introduced uh last year

00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,839
finalized last year and then we wanted

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,200
to

00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:20,880
um to write an article about this okay

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,599
and usually so we try to find a good

00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,640
example

00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,560
um for the data

00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,079
uh visualizing our application so in

00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,640
this concrete example so

00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:34,079
i selected i chose the data for the

00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:36,560
distribution of the hydrogen in our

00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,440
um galaxy so what you see here so the

00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,920
three peaks

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,760
are bases so the measurement 24

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,200
essentially at 21 centimeter emission

00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,079
line of the hydrogen

00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:48,400
is measured in a certain direction

00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,440
relative to our position relative to our

00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,920
solar system

00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,960
and as you know so our galaxy has a

00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,599
spiral

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,640
form and into the direction uh uh where

00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:59,839
this measurement sun

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:02,800
into so we basically see cb

00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:03,599
probe this emission uh coming from the

00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,720
three

00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,000
spiral arms okay because of this spiral

00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,119
arms having the different

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,640
velocities because of the doppler shift

00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:16,640
so this emission line is shifted

00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,400
okay and these three spikes you see

00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,720
there's three peaks you see here

00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,599
basically they correspond to the three

00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,640
uh spiral arms of our galaxy that are

00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:28,800
visible

00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:30,960
from our from our solar system okay so

00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,240
very very nice example very nice physics

00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,920
behind this so i was

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:37,680
i i really liked this example i was

00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,599
proud of it okay i was really really

00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,280
proud of it and then on the next day we

00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,520
produce another tweet so this was kind

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,960
of a fun tweet where we

00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:49,200
i did a picture of my um

00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,800
workspace of my desk okay and then we

00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,920
invited our

00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,960
followers to to a small quiz so we

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,280
asked to find to identify 12 kde

00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,240
related things so what you see on this

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,760
picture is

00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:04,880
my cat so he was a bit aggressive at

00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,359
this point in time he

00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,200
aggressively refused to leave the desk

00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:11,680
okay since i didn't have enough time for

00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,119
this activity for this photo session

00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,440
and i didn't want to escalate the

00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,960
situation a bit further i decided to

00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,560
leave him on the desk and then do a

00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,560
picture with him okay

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,440
um well this tweet with the cat

00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:29,280
brought us four times more attention use

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,560
an impression on twitter

00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:36,240
okay so apparently having uh uh

00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:37,280
with the cat is um more popular more

00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,040
attractive than

00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,800
talking about the distribution of the

00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,640
high direction in your galaxy

00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,400
okay so this is a lesson belong from

00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,640
this and maybe this is also the

00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,400
recommendation for everybody who is who

00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,720
is uh tweeting

00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,160
um cats seems to be very very popular

00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,040
not either so if you manage to

00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,160
incorporate

00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:58,000
cat in one of your tweets um

00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,359
attention impressions are guaranteed for

00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,560
you

00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:05,920
okay so kind of a fun fact

00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:08,960
and i think this is also the last slide

00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,560
um the last slide in my presentation so

00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,040
thank you everybody for your attention

00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,640
so

00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,240
i think we still have some time for

00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,480
questions and if you are watching the

00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,720
recording now and would like to

00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,160
reach out to us asking questions so this

00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,640
is uh um

00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,880
the link to our home page multiple ways

00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,760
uh documented the how to reach

00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,400
out to us and i think so using the our

00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,400
room on

00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,640
metrics and pds metrics is maybe the

00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,720
most easiest most comfortable way

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,119
to get in contact with us thanks

00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,119
everybody

00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,319
yeah there is one question in the shared

00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,720
notes if

00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,720
you can

00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:52,720
have you found any correlation between

00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,720
software internalization and code

00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:57,599
contribution

00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,599
um

00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:05,119
to be honest not i mean of course

00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,800
we know so and by checking the

00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:10,000
statistics we know

00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:13,520
into which languages this software was

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,400
was um was translated and we have couple

00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,160
of um so 3d we have couple of

00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,160
translators who are more

00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,079
active okay so on we have we have

00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,800
software kde software is

00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,680
translated in in some languages you know

00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,760
to a better

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,280
extent compared to other languages but

00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,040
this doesn't mean you know so we have

00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,800
more contributors here so we have maybe

00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:35,599
one or two persons doing this and

00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,960
they simply have more more time here

00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:40,400
okay to do this work

00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,680
and um so with respect to according to

00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,920
writing code i

00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:46,160
also don't see any any relation any

00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:49,200
correlation any interdependence

00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,640
between the different

00:44:49,200 --> 00:45:05,839
languages and generalization we are

00:44:50,640 --> 00:45:05,839
supporting and the code contribution

00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:16,160
so this next question being written down

00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:19,839
right now which activities did really

00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,839
help attract people to the project

00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,960
so we just as of this year we started uh

00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,440
trying to quantify the success of this

00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,640
approach

00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,480
okay by monitoring the um

00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,240
the number of downloads number of

00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,960
downloads checking statistics

00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:37,599
for you know for linux distribution

00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:40,480
checking the number of downloads from

00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:42,400
from the microsoft store flat flat hub

00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,400
repositories and so on and so on okay so

00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,800
this is we are still in the process of

00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,720
defining metrics that we will use to

00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,079
quantify basically the success

00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,839
okay right now i would say so the

00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:54,400
personal impression is

00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:56,160
uh um publishing more producing more

00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,520
noise around your project so publishing

00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,160
coming on the home page you know

00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,760
providing

00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,839
additional documentation as nice

00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,400
examples and so on and so on this is

00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:04,960
this is what helped to attract new users

00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,720
and

00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,480
right now we measured this basically by

00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:11,040
the number of emails

00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,720
personal emails we get we get everybody

00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,560
using number of pack reports feature

00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,960
requests and so on and so on so i

00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,720
right now i would say the promotional

00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,920
promotional work we did

00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:24,240
on in the recent past

00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,319
uh brought us more attention more new

00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,160
users

00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:29,359
than the new features were released

00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,040
recently

00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:32,560
okay and this is the reason why i said

00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,480
okay so there's a certain

00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,880
change in the mindset happening right

00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,640
now where we say now okay so the

00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,319
level of maturity of the project is

00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,319
maybe good enough now

00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,240
and so the application is usable for

00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:45,280
many many users coming from many many

00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,520
different academic

00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,119
uh communities so we simply need to

00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,960
reach out to them to introduce the

00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:53,119
project and try to attract

00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,520
attract new users okay this is what is

00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:58,079
happening right now so we see new users

00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,640
coming coming and getting in contact

00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,110
with us

00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,720
so promotional work definitely is that

00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:05,079
[Music]

00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:08,079
had the heaviest impact in the recent

00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:08,079
