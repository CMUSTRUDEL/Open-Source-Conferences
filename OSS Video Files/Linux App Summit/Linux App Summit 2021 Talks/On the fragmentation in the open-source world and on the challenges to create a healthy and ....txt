	On the fragmentation in the open-source world and on the challenges to create a healthy and sustainable project maintanence.



Many open source projects fail to create a sustainable setup and constant and healthy growth, to adopt to new needs and changes and to survive over many years. Limited amount of time and human resources is usually the major factor for this. In this presentation we're going to talk about the fragmentation of resources in the area of applications for interactive analysis and visualization of scientific data (LabPlot, SciDAVis, Veusz, Kst, AlphaPlot, etc.), challenges caused by this and how we're trying to overcome them now at LabPlot.
