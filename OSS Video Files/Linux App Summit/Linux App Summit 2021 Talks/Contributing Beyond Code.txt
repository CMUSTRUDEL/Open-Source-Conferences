Title: Contributing Beyond Code
Publication date: 2021-05-30
Playlist: Linux App Summit 2021 Talks
Description: 
	This talk aims to share my experience, challenges, contributions with contributing to the Scalable Onboarding project, Extensions Rebooted Initiative, and volunteering for Guadec 2020. Over time I have noticed that non-code contributions are not usually appreciated so much so asides from hearing my story, it will be a call-to-action for attendees to appreciate non-code contributors. For first-time contributors that will attend my talk, it will help them understand how to contribute via some tips I will share from my experience in the past year.
