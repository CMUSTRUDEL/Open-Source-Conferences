Title: Contributing Beyond Code
Publication date: 2021-05-30
Playlist: Linux App Summit 2021 Talks
Description: 
	This talk aims to share my experience, challenges, contributions with contributing to the Scalable Onboarding project, Extensions Rebooted Initiative, and volunteering for Guadec 2020. Over time I have noticed that non-code contributions are not usually appreciated so much so asides from hearing my story, it will be a call-to-action for attendees to appreciate non-code contributors. For first-time contributors that will attend my talk, it will help them understand how to contribute via some tips I will share from my experience in the past year.

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,240
uh it's less than a year that i started

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,479
doing open source contributions i

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,799
started doing open source contributions

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:52,000
three months into my coding journey

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,119
at july so i'm going to be taking you

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
through the story

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,000
of all my open source contributions with

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,159
the gnome foundation

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,159
and i hope you enjoy my story

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:11,840
so yeah i started my open source uh

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,680
contributions with the women of open

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,640

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,879
africa is

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,800
an initiative by the open source

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,080
community here in africa

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,120
and another another group called the um

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,280
another ngo called the chico africa that

contribute to open source

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,800
right so that was the launch there was a

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,800
launch of the

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,560
program of the initiative and you know

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,760
that was like a little

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,280
workshop to get you to contribute

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:10,560
give your first open source contribution

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,040
and i was three months into coding then

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,040
um i i have a microbiology degree i

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,239
transitioned from microbiology

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,840
to doing tech so i was three months

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,159
into country into coding and i said okay

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,840
open source seems like a good thing for

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,080
me to start on with

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,840
and before now i'm also like a social

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,799
volunteer so volunteering has been

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,360
something i am really passionate about

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,400
so i said okay i'm going to attend this

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,000
uh i'm going to

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,400
attend this um this um launch

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,760
for a worst car that's women of open

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,000

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,280
so i attended the lunch i i think i

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,280
attended late

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,200
and you know during the workshop i said

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,239
okay let me give it a try

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,840
and we used um the first contributions

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,080
um repository the

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,760
one of the popular first repositories

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,360
people do their first open source

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,560
contributions with

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,040
so we used the first um we used the

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,760
first contributions repository to do a

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,640
practice

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,319
for the workshop and you know i was

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,879
struggling because i was trying to you

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,959
know get i had never used gates before

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,840
that was like my first git experience

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,759
i'm going to tell you about my

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,759
challenges with it later on

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,320
during the session so uh i have um

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,000
never used gates before and we are

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,000
supposed to use git i had to you know

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,240
download git on my system

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,240
and try to follow up with the conference

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,280
i was even jotting down

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,840
while the um speaker was trying to help

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,440
us

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,680
set up git and everything and

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,600
i didn't even know how i made this

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,880
contribution you can see this is a

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,240
screenshot

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,520
of um a tweet i made um

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,680
after making the the poo and my pull

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,680
request was merged after making the pull

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,040
request to add my name to the first

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,160
contributions

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,479
so i immediately tweeted about this um

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,560
after i was able to you know send in a

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,600
pull request for the first time

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,800
and it got so many engagements like you

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,080
can see here

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,840
i had over 200 likes on

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,120
on this um of people telling me

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,120
congratulations for making your first

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,600
open source contribution

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,000
and you know i was so happy because i

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,960
just basically added my name

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,440
to i just basically added my name to the

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,199
um

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,600
contributors list and people were saying

00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:37,120
congratulations and

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,320
it was it was so nice and i said okay

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:44,000
i think that i i want to keep doing this

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,120
and fortunately um women of open south

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,520
africa had a

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,280
challenge in the month of july that was

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,320
starting in the month of july

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,320
so it's similar to the um

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,840
october first challenge you know where

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,960
you get the the

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:02,000
the um the criteria was get um

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,240
a good amount of pull requests made to

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,039
contribute to different organizations

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,240
and you're going to get a price so in

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:13,039
the month of july i put my heads down

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,120
to start looking for open source

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:19,120
organizations that i could

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,600
i could um start contributing to

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,600
and it was it was like it was really

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,800
very hard for me at first because

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,720
i just used it for the first time and

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,840
i'm somebody that is very very

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,120
inquisitive

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,600
so i was like okay um how am i going to

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,720
start

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:40,080
finding projects that i would contribute

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:43,039
to so let's go to how i found

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,039
known projects

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,680
so i want to take you through my

00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,400
engagement room

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,319
but first i'll pause here and say thank

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,919
you so much to sri

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:59,280
sri has been amazing like siri is um

00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:02,479
the gnome uncle so he has been a

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,680
very good um it has been a very good

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:08,319
mess all through my contributions

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,759
both with noam and both with other

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,840
organizations that i have

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,039
been able to make impactful

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,919
contributions

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:18,080
to so this is a shout out to shree and

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:22,080
also a shout out to

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:24,720
peace oj and also sam cincotti they were

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,440
very very helpful with me finding the

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,880
project

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:32,240
and start my first contributions

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,240
with the gnome project

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:43,599
so i was um i was just three months

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,800
into coding i was taking a python

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,840
classes

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,960
self learning by myself

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,759
i tried to i was looking for projects i

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,879
could get

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,919
involved with and then

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,879
at that time the scalable onboarding

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,400
project

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:05,520
led by sri was ongoing and

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,319
i joined the jitsu room first like that

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,840
was my first time together about gtc

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,879
i i only knew about google meets and

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,560
zoom

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:19,520
but when i joined gtc room or

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,160
on the first day of the meeting i just

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,360
started i just stayed quiet to listen to

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,400
everything

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,440
i felt lost but then i had some

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,800
courage um because you know they were

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,560
willing to hear my

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,159
opinions i was coming into the call for

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,279
the first time

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:42,159
and they asked for my opinions and

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,000
they wanted to know what i thought about

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,560
project or they were questioned and i

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,920
tried

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,120
also to give my opinions right

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:54,240
and then i i was told

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,040
we're going to be using gitlab and i was

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,160
only

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:01,200
conversants with github because

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,720
remember i was three months into my

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,480
coding journey

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,519
so i said okay i think i would have to

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,640
make i saw um i saw a a

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,200
change um on the change was needed on

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,480
the readme

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,839
um so i was like okay i can i can make

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,720
this change and remember

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,519
i was on the most wooska challenge right

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,200
i was

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:30,320
uh i had to get some pull requests

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,720
by the end of july so i needed to start

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,519
making my contributions and i started

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,240
the scalable onboarding project on git

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,519
lab

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,000
it had a readme fix to be fixed and i

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,760
said okay let me try to contribute to

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,959
this project by changing

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,000
the typos on the readme and

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:53,920
making my first contribution was

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,959
a was an interesting and

00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,320
a frustrating one because i

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:03,680
struggled with gifts and ssh

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,079
like i i remember there was a particular

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,480
night

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,000
i did not sleep because i am somebody

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,800
that is very eager

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,200
like i i want to if i start on something

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,560
i'm

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:18,160
so eager to want to finish it so

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:21,040
i was i had to stay up all night

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,839
trying to send in my uh sending my

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,480
change

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,000
i was struggling with setting up ssh and

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,880
all the other things

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,600
but you know um with the help of a

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,640
friend

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,600
um okay i was able to you know push my

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,079
change and you know it got um the first

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,880
one

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,320
it was having so many errors and i tried

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,360
again the second day

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,160
and it went through so basically after

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,959
making those

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,279
with me changes i got involved with the

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,760
calls and trying to set up

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,480
this project so the scalable onboarding

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,360
project

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,320
is basically how do we make onboarding

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,800
scalable

00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,680
how do we improve the operating system

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,360
in norm

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:06,480
so we're trying to um you know set up

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,600
all those so i was fully involved with

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,800
this project

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,440
another project that i you know engaged

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,720
with

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,320
was the faces of no so um the first

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,600
thing i've known was a website

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,000
like appreciate um to appreciate um

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,880
you know contributors gnome foundation

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,640
members

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:29,600
and i tried you know i tried to

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,839
do some overhaul on the uh deduction

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,800
documentation and seeing things i could

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,600
improve

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,079
then also another project that i'm also

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,120
proud to be part of

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:44,320
is the extensions rebooted initiative

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,120
so um we are trying to make the

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,279
extensions no extensions you know trying

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,000
to create a conversation between the

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,600
gnome

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,800
um developers and extension developers

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,000
so that at every

00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,800
needs um extensions no

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
extension would not break so all these

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,720
projects that

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,040
listed here that are listed here even

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,320
though

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,000
i was not able to you know i was still

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,959
finding my way around

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,040
coding i was still able to meaningfully

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:18,320
contribute to these projects

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,079
i was able to write um on the extensions

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,120
rebooted initiative

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:26,639
i i was able to you know write

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,320
a blog post with um in together with sri

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,200
and you know i was able to look at the

00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:34,000
documentation and do

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,720
try to see what i can do to make it

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,360
better

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,399
so it goes beyond saying that open

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,560
source is

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,560
more than code right

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,480
so let's

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,560
so let me talk about my challenges

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,800
during contributing

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,240
because you know for non-code

00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,000
contributors

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,000
there are so many challenges

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,200
so there are so many um challenges that

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,519
i encountered

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,440
even though it was a very good journey

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,560
for me even though it was really

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,639
very sweet and very interesting let me

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:21,839
tell you about the challenges i

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,839
encountered contributing

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,360
so let's talk about my technical

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,399
difficulties

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,200
so i told you earlier that i had some

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,560
very

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:37,200
very very crazy issues with kids

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,839
so i was using git for the first time

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,320
and

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,839
i think you know over time over the

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,560
period of one year

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,560
i would say everybody has these problems

00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:52,000
because still today

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,079
i still have my issues with kids but

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,360
then starting was a whole lot

00:13:54,079 --> 00:14:00,880
but a whole lot more difficult because

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:04,240
i was just getting started and it

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,560
was a whole lot for me but then with you

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,440
know

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,120
trying to be consistent and with help i

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,320
got from the community

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,680
i got better which isn't good now

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:18,079
another technical difficulty i faced

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,959
was you know installing and setting up

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,240
you know

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:25,519
i use a windows operating system

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,160
so you know finding how to set up and

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,199
install

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,560
was a big problem for me it was so

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,480
difficult for me

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,880
i know there were times where i i had to

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,760
read a lot of dogs i had to do a lot of

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,880
things

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,519
and then network bandwidth here in my

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,720
country

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:45,920
sometimes most times network is quite

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:49,279
very poor so joining the meetings

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,279
i had to you know sometimes i would try

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,079
to speak and they wouldn't be

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,240
nobody would be able to hear me because

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,480
my network was quite poor

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,600
and that was that's like an issue that

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,360
you know um

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,800
most people that it's not like when

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,920
you're not able to get

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:09,040
good and better internet

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,760
um you you get to face this next network

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,600
bandwidth

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,320
issues right and also i had electricity

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,480
issues

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,360
there were some times where i needed to

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,560
work with my laptop but i did not have

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,199
um power to you know power my laptop so

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,839
sometimes it delayed my contributions

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,399
and also my communications and also

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,240
sometimes

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:39,920
it could delay my enthusiasm to continue

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:40,480
but then happily i still pushed forward

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,759
so

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:47,519
communication difficulties now

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,160
um i am from africa and i'm from nigeria

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,199
so

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,759
i had the accent trying to hear

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:57,040
when someone else is speaking was quite

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:59,279
hard for me even when i tried to speak

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,320
also sometimes i would have to repeat

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,360
myself

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,279
over and over again for you know the

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,079
other person to hear me

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:10,480
and it's not it's not much it's not um

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:13,199
it's normal because you know ascent

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,399
differs so you know i had to battle with

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,959
a whole lot of this

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,199
but i had to try talking because i am

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:22,399
somebody that talks really fast

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:25,680
so i have to try and place in my words

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:29,120
i had to talk slowly so the other person

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,680
would be able to clearly hear me

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,560
so there were also difficulties with me

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,920
understanding technical and social terms

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:41,199
that were unique to the gnome project so

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,680
if during um on the rocket chat

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:46,000
or on the chat channel someone is

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,639
talking about something that you know i

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,399
was not

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:52,800
conversants with it it was like it was

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,959
hard for me to understand these terms

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,839
because i was just starting

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,920
so i also had slack in communication

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,680
like with time zones right

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:06,480
so initially when i started

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,880
initially when i started um i did not

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,799
understand the time zone difference

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,880
so when i would send a message and you

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:16,079
know there was no response in like

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,799
five hours i was like oh is this person

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,280
did this person not gets my message but

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,079
then

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,079
later on i got to understand that you

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,600
know that time zones differ

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:30,840
and it's it can be night time at the

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,840
other end of the world

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,840
right

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,720
so now i have talked about my

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,960
difficulties

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,880
i want to tell you about what i loved

00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,720
contributing not just contributing code

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,039
but contributing beyond

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,039
code

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,960
the community it's there is so much to

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,240
be

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:05,840
done in the community i

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:09,840
saw beyond the software right i saw

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:13,039
beyond because um you know i saw people

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,160
trying to understand the software i saw

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,520
i saw beyond

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:20,400
um beyond code and was able

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,960
to contribute to the community helping

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,760
the community management help with uh

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,559
even not just with them but with other

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,039
organizations that i actively contribute

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,080
to

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,720
i was part of the community management

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,000
i always tried to look for ways i could

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,880
help

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,360
i could help somebody else at the other

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,440
end

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,120
i always try to look for ways i could

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,559
you know improve

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:49,840
or promote people that were contributing

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:53,520
so i really love the community work and

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:57,600
i will always be a community farm

00:18:53,520 --> 00:19:00,640
also i try to create a niche for myself

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,840
while contributing to open source

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,039
so i i found out because of the

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,240
difficulties i

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:11,360
had contributing i started

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,160
advocating for beginners because i found

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,039
out that

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,440
in most open source projects beginners

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,559
are

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:22,240
not well appreciated and they're like i

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:25,360
i saw that and i said okay what i'll try

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,080
my best in whatever community i find

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,120
myself

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,760
in try to advocate for beginners

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,240
try to tell them you can get into open

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,280
source

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,919
because most people think it's just code

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,400
it's just about the software but so many

00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,919
people

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,400
do not you can actually

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,200
do other things you can engage in

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,440
community you can engage in

00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,480
documentation

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:54,960
i also try to do public speaking

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:57,200
to um to help others understand that yes

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,799
you can contribute to open source

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,080
without having to write

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:05,120
code and also quality impact that he

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,080
brought on the software so a bit about

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,120
this i am

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:12,240
part of the chaos um badging

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,880
chaos badging project and you know

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,760
we are trying what that badging project

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,799
is about it's um

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:23,840
giving diversity and inclusion

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:26,880
inclusive badges to conferences that

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,640
observe this metrics so over time

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,000
contributing to that project

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,799
i was able to see how people would

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,600
change

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,480
their their their metrics to you know

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,679
suit

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,640
diverse diverse cultures right so

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,880
there's a lot of quality impact i was

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:49,840
able to make and i see them and that

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,840
makes me love open source contributions

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,240
yes there were rewards and con

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,280
recognitions

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,480
so we're contributing to open source

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,679
right i've got a lot of

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,400
a lot of recognitions both from

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,880
persons and both from organizations

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,520
right

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,559
because these organizations i i have

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,200
been part of

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:17,679
were really helpful to my quotes there

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,080
were rewards for me there were

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,960
recognitions which i'll talk about in

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,960
the next slide

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,799
so one of the biggest rewards was

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:34,880
becoming a github star

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:37,520
so rewind back to when i said i am just

00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,080
i'm barely one year so june is going to

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,880
make it one year of contributing to open

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,640
source

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:47,919
and for my contributions and the impact

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,240
i have made the people i have inspired

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,720
and

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:56,080
have been able to educate i believe

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,480
this year and it was so amazing because

00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,600
i

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:03,120
was like the first um female

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,159
um from from africa right i was in the

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,760
midst of

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:10,880
um in list of three amazing

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,720
uh male uh milk guys so i

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,919
there were people that you know i have

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,799
always looked

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,320
up looked up to and you know getting

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,120
that recognition meant

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,760
a whole lot to me and it's you know

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,240
spoiling me to keep contributing and to

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,679
keep inspiring and educating

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,640
others and also recently i got

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:35,200
some swags from google open source they

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:39,600
recognized my contributions

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:42,080
um with no chaos and they sent me some

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:45,679
swags which was pretty interesting

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,919
because while i was unboxing those swags

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,320
i unboxed it with my parents

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,280
and they were so happy that you know i

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,080
made

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,559
in i have been inspiring i have been

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,840
doing

00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:01,120
amazing things by myself

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:04,480
right and also i got an award as

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,039
a guitar star so when the award came it

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,760
was so beautiful it's so beautiful

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:11,360
rather

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:14,000
and you know i it made me love

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,320
more things about contributing to open

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,320
source

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:26,240
now how can you help how can you

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,640
you know create a more inclusive space

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,840
for

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:33,120
non-code contributors how can you

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:37,840
um how can you encourage more beginners

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,840
to get involved in open source

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,279
recognize and appreciate non-code

00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,559
contributions in your project or your

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:50,080
community

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:52,320
so this is a call a call to action

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,640
for you listening for everybody

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,440
listening to this talk

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,559
recognize non-contributions in your

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,440
community

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:03,039
in your projects set channels and

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,159
pipelines to encourage

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:09,200
non-code contributions appreciate them

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,320
and you know tell um try to encourage

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,760
their work

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,960
try to um put the spotlights on them

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,400
open source is not just about code right

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,720
try to show empathy in your

00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,200
communications

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,320
in your engagement with non-code

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,480
contributors

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,080
even generally while you're

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,279
communicating because

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:33,520
you know it's it's a diverse team

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:36,720
and you do not understand you might not

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:39,360
know what the other person at the end of

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,000
the at the other end is feeling other

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,720
moments

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,320
so please try to show empathy while

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,360
you're communicating

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,640
and also the most important thing i want

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,679
you to take away

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,799
from this session is recognize and

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,240
appreciate

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:58,840
non-code contributions set channels and

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,240
pipelines to encourage those non-code

00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:04,159
contributions and

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,400
also to look at beginners coming into

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:09,039
your project because they are helpful

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,679
beginners see things from a different

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:13,120
end

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:15,440
right so try to encourage beginners

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,120
that come into your project try to make

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,440
things easier for them

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,559
try to tell them okay if this is not

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,480
your spark

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,880
if you can't try python you could

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,840
contribute to documentation

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,320
you could help with community engagement

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,880
so

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,760
try this is a call-out action to

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,840
everybody

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,799
that is listening present into this

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,360
store and

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:42,000
persons are going to listen to this book

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:45,440
in future

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,400
so uh i'll take questions if there are

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:57,840
any questions

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:57,840
at this point

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,120
thank you very much for your talk very

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:12,320
very interesting

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,799
there's actually only um one

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,720
question in the short note i'm not sure

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:19,279
if someone else is writing right now

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,919
i know there is someone texting in the

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,080
chat

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,440
so initially if you can access the

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,960
shared note if you want me to read the

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,480
question for you if you prefer to read

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,480
it yourself

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,799
i'm trying to assess it it's still

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:39,840
loading on my end so you can try to read

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:39,840
it too

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,080
so the first question is whether you

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,520
have considered using a graphical

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,720
interface to access

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:56,240
git okay um

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:59,520
so yes i actually tried using the

00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,480
github um desktop

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,279
um but there are some limitations to

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,520
using

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,360
on one of the projects i start

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,080
contributing with

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,440
so i you would always need to sign off

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,840
your commits

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,400
when you create a commit and that was

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,799
not available with github desktop

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,000
so on that particular project there was

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,720
no way i could use

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,600
github desktop so i had to stick with

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,600
using kits

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,200
uh i think uh if the but definitely i

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,960
still encourage

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:44,159
um beginners to also try out using our

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:49,200
the github desktop too so yeah

00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:52,640
it works

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,640
is there any other question

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:59,039
second question which is what are good

00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:01,440
channels to reach non-tech people

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:03,520
i suppose things like erc and guitar are

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,679
still very tech focused

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,679
and so are issue lists on github

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:13,919
okay so channels to reach non-tech

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,480
so you know twitter the tech community

00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,159
first

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:21,279
of all the tech community on twitter is

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,679
one very active one so you know you

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,159
could

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,240
reach you could reach out um non-tech

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,720
people from you know making call outs if

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,919
your

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,039
if your product has a has a twitter

00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,679
channel

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,039
you can do a call out um and

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,600
specifically

00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,039
states that you encourage non-code

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,760
contributions

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:43,039
and you know encourage them to either

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,880
send a dm

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,399
or make it in the comments and

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,600
definitely you would get

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:50,000
responses and also maybe when whenever

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,279
you

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,559
introduce your projects in conferences

00:28:53,279 --> 00:29:00,080
or wherever you talk about your project

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,720
also put it there that you um there are

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,440
different

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,440
ways to contribute to your project

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,320
non-code contributions are always

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,200
welcome

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,240
so i trust that putting it out there you

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,240
know attracts

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:27,840
whosoever wants to contribute um

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:27,840
without code to contribute

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,919
there is also a third question which is

00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,080
if you have a blog

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:40,000
where people can read about your open

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:42,799
source journey

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,559
um sorry can you repeat that question

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,640
again

00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,919
sure so the question is asking whether

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,840
you have a blog

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,840
where people can read about your open

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,799

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,600

so i'm going to paste that into the

00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:37,840
chats in a second

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:45,919
