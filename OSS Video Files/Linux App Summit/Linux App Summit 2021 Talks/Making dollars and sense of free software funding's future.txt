Title: Making dollars and sense of free software funding's future
Publication date: 2021-05-30
Playlist: Linux App Summit 2021 Talks
Description: 
	Sustainably funding public goods is hard, just ask your local government. We know free software benefits everyone, whether or not users contributed to its development. How then can we reach the world of everyone working on software they love, while making a livable wage? Let's discuss the current funding platforms, where they work, where they don't, and what does free software really need for a sustainable and successful future?

Disclaimer: I am with the team building Snowdrift.coop While we believe that we're addressing some of these questions, we a) aren't there yet, and b) know that there are plenty of unaddressed areas on the way to a free software utopia. This will not just be a pitch for our platform, promise!

Q&A


 1. On yesterday's talk on Krita's funding, Halla said sheâ€™s not so interested in focusing on features requested by companies anymore because most don't support the project, meanwhile individual users are more likely to support the project. What are some funding options where more people who are making use of the software get to support the software?

2. What do you think of Blenders funding model?

3. another "what do you think of" question that I'm curious about is Open Prioritization :-) (https://www.igalia.com/open-prioritization/index)

making dollars and cents of free

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,760
software funding's

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:38,239
do i best future this uh

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,239

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,000
um it's kind of one of the things that's

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,119
been driving

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,520
my interest for a long time

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,119
and you can find me at alt salt pretty

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,760
much everywhere.net

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,439
in different places i've been using

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,920
linux since 1996

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,799
and speaking and organizing groups and

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,479
conferences

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:25,920
and whatnot since about 2005.

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,280
but recently i've been spending my time

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,640
kind of in a

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,680
few core areas so

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,799
uh the first one is academia i recently

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,079
got my

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,920
master's thesis submitted and defended

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,240
just over a month ago and i've been

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,799
spending a lot of

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,920
energy and time doing that for the last

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,920
four years

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,360
right now i'm in a phd program to

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,640
continue with that

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,479
uh thank you very much and um my focus

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,360
has really been on

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,159
tech policy and then peer production

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,880
communities

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,520
uh policies what not around all of that

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,320
area

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,360
so kind of our space my second area has

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,840
been events

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,280
and uh specifically for the last eight

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,360
years i've been involved with seagull

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,879
the seattle canoe linux conference

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,440
you can see a little signal here a

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,480
little seagull there seal everywhere

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,040
uh our ninth event is uh ninth year is

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,120
coming up

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,080
and we have announced that we're going

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,040
to be virtual

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,680
uh so please check us out cfp will be

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,760
out

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,959
sometime next month that'll be november

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,080
5th and 6th

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,200
the last one is crowd matching so this

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,160
is uh kind of an area i've been involved

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,640
in for

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,319
over five years now and part of what i'm

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,239
going to be discussing today

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,400
so i'm technically the community

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,760
director of snowdrift.coop

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,000
and we've been a osi

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,200
incubator project now and we're about to

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,560
graduate

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,519
and move on to actually being launched

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,800
and

00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,879
making some of this uh stuff a reality

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,720
that said we're also waiting from the to

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,560
hear back from the fsf high priorities

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,080
project committee and

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,280
we've applied and we actually wrote out

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,120
i think quite a good thing so if you

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,480
have some time to read that blog post

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,120
i'd recommend it that's me

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,040
what are we what are we here for what is

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:23,040
what is today

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,040
so looking at the really high level

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,440
i'm going to talk to you about a wicked

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,080
problem

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,120
and the wicked problem is that

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,400
everything

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,000
comes down to coordination it's

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,680
kind of the defining characteristic of

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,159
homo sapiens

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,400
this ability to coordinate to have a

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,519
shared systems of understanding

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,680
they enable us to have a society they

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:51,280
let's build these amazing things

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,159
but sometimes these things are harmful

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,159
sometimes they're great

00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:00,080
currently knowledge commons exists

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:03,200
in this attention economy and that

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,159
introduced surveillance and advertising

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,680
which is a whole bunch of um not so nice

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,799
things

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,560
but what alternatives do we have

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,239
and what would a world look like if we

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,799
were just

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,799
free to create well

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,400
what we're going to be talking about

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,400
here over the next

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,280
30 minutes or so is we're going to go

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,880
through the definitions

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,720
so that we're kind of on the same page

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,880
about things let me give you a

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:41,600
brief history of public goods funding

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,000
talk about kind of the current state of

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,800
funding

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
how it's you know how we are funding

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,680
this stuff

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,280
and then some of the solutions that are

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,720
actively being worked on

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,720
so these are the um

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,040
one thing is our project but there are

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,120
others

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,720
and then the future as i see it the

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,919
future that

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,440
kind of hoping to build

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:12,479
with uh with all of you so

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:15,919
starting with the definitions

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,720
now there's a lot of terms that we could

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,120
go over

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,199
i'm gonna not try to belabor some of

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,800
them

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,800
if you want to go deeper i'm happy to

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,600
have those conversations elsewhere

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,800
but there are there are a few that are

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,160
kind of valuable for

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,680
uh moving the conversation forward so

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,440
the ones that i want you to keep in mind

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,720
as i go through these are the public

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,840
goods

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,440
uh the commons uh free library open

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,160
source software

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,560
tragedy of the commons and uh free

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,560
writing

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:55,120
make sure that i do not disturb

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,120
my computers okay so

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:02,880
let's start with what are the publicans

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:05,280
what is what is the commons now

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,199
public goods as a term is a concept from

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,680
economics

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,199
it was attributed to paul samuelson in

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,520
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,199
and then expanded by richard musgrave

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:19,520
and garrett hardin

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,000
in the 60s its current form as we

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,199
understand

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,280
it was kind of put forth by eleanor

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,800
ostrom in 1990.

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:32,160
now what you see on the screen here is

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,720
the ostrom 2x2 matrix it's displaying

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,160
four types of goods and they're

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,440
differentiated by these

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,440
kind of two

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:47,360
characteristics so the first one

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:51,120
is rivalry this is whether something's

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,360
usefulness is diminished through usage

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,639
and the second one is excludability

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,800
that's whether

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,440
the use can be restricted can you

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,400
exclude people from it

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,360
now examples of each for each of these

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,840
four

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,560
the one i like to say for private good

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,120
is

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,400
like a piece of clothing like a hat if

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,919
i'm wearing the hat

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,720
you can't also be wearing that same hat

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,080
a club good is again somewhere where you

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,880
put a wall around it

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,080
so usually you might think of an

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,400
amusement park

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,400
right

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:32,880
i mean private club club good

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,919
then there's common pool resources now

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,720
common pool resources uh

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,120
are these these areas where there there

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,000
are

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,080
there is rivalrousness there's a limited

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,840
amount of resources

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,599
but it's not excluded it's not

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,879
excludable it's it's uh

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,440
commonly accessible so an idea here

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,639
might be an

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,520
ocean full of fish now ocean full of

00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,000
fish

00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,000
uh everyone has the fish but

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,840
you can imagine that there are a limited

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,280
number of fish

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,800
and so it is a

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,479
common pool of resource the last one and

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,199
the one we're going to talk about a lot

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,520
here

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:20,240
are public goods now public globes

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,199
can be thought of as as things that

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,520
everyone can share

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,440
and uh sharing is not diminishing it for

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,120
anyone else

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,320
the one that i like to talk about but

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,839
um it's only my hope that will it will

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,399
continue to be a public good

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,200
is clean air right this idea of like i'm

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,240
breathing air

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:43,360
you're breathing air that's not

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,399
in in a broad sense diminishing

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,399
the air quality

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:53,760
all right so that framing of

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,959
economic terms kind of gets us to what

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,560
the public goods are

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,760
explains a little bit about the comments

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,160
we'll come back to that shortly

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,120
the next big area i know this is going

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,839
to be

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,519
common to most of you but is free libre

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,800
open source software

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,519
now in the 1980s uh

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,160
richard stallman rms came up with this

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,920
idea

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,360
to turn copyright back on itself

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,279
and what we commonly refer to as

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,480
copyleft

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:27,279
and the idea behind that is

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,839
to really turn things that are otherwise

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:33,360
being licensed and restricted

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,200
into public goods now

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,959
it's been extended outside the scope of

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,080
software things like

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:43,680
creative commons and

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:47,279
it's also been misappropriated right

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,160
it's open source watch watching

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,600
and despite the arguments over the years

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,760
i just go with flow

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,200
right i'm going to go with the flow free

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,000
library open i actually think

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,880
each one brings something different and

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,720
valuable

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:05,040
to the conversation but

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,640
just to be clear we are talking about uh

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,800
the free software movement

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:15,279
and um specifically when things are flow

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:18,000
licensed they become public goods

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,760
again uh not to get into the the

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,680
difference between the

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,120
uh terms all that much here but um

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,800
that is actually part of what my thesis

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,519
is about and breaking down this idea

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,399
premise is

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,680
permissive and protective because the

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,160
copyleft stuff

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,600
keeps things public goods whereas the

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,399
permissive licenses

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,560
only make the initial instance a

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:44,320
publication

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:47,360
but there's two kind of related

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,720
like deeply related items when we talk

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,200
about

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,640
free uh free library opens for software

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,920
floss

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,399
and i guess public goods in general

00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,680
but but um public goods and the commons

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,600
in general

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,959
so the first one is called the tragedy

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,680
of the commons

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,399
and this is actually related to that

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,640
older term

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,120
okay i mentioned we'd go back to it of

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,720
the commons um

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:17,760
this talk i gave earlier this year

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,360
at libre planet and

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,720
uh i was a little retired was just

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,560
going through things and someone

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,720
actually pointed out that i kind of

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,000
conflated the history of the commons and

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,959
the public goods and all that so i'm

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,320
trying to make that a little more clear

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,440
the history of the commons extends back

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,360
to at least

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:42,720
the 1550s in great britain

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,720
likely before then but the tragedy of

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,760
the commons was first written about

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:52,079
by william forster lloyd in 1833

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,839
and brought into modern attention as

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,880
well as actually being named

00:11:53,839 --> 00:12:00,160
tragedy of the commons by garrett hardin

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:03,600
in 1968

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,959
the idea behind this is commons will

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,160
collapse

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:10,800
if they're overused right

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,079
and not only that that a lot of game

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,480
theory basically shows

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,360
it's in everyone's uh maybe not best

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,160
interest but

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,920
it's it's natural to overuse these

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,560
resources

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,440
now ostrom demonstrated that it's

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,760
avoidable

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,760
uh through proper governance actually

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:35,920
yeah how quickly can i can i pull out uh

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,920
the awesome book governing the commons

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,160
so

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,079
that's the tragedy of the commons and we

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,760
we have know about it

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,360
um and we'll get back to why we're

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,800
defining these terms

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,240
fairly shortly the other big problem

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,160
that's often discussed

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,639
is the free writer problem now

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,920
what this is is that through the

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:04,000
widespread use of public goods

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,000
without providing support back

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,920
we get degradation we have uh

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,639
excess pressure on those people who do

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,519
support the public goods right if

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,519
if um

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,880
everyone rides the bus for free who pays

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,800
for the maintenance

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:30,160
right and of course buses aren't

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:36,000
maybe always the best but

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:39,279
example but transit as a broader system

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,560
now um

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:45,120
this talk is mostly going to focus

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,040
on public goods and the free writer

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,079
problem

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:53,279
and when i think of public goods

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:56,480
what i really think of is

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:59,760
public information goods that's because

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,959
it uh you know as i've come up a few

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,560
times here

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,720
thinking about what a public good is can

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,279
be tricky uh when you're talking about

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,519
tangible things

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,040
you know it's they often talk about

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,720
national security

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,720
or the radio wave spectrum

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,079
it takes a lot of work to get that

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,880
abstract concept

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,839
but if you think of it as information

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,800
information

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,199
can be shared without it costing barely

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,839
anything

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,519
it does cost some time some electricity

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,800
there are things like that but the costs

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,720
start going away

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,079
they become minimal and by having the

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,519
costs go away

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,440
it can it can be a lot easier to

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,720
conceptualize these things as true

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,120
publicates

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,600
as long as they're staying not

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,600
excludable

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,120
now uh what i think of when i think

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,399
information goods

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,959
i think of software as we've discussed

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,399
and i think of research think of

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,040
journalism

00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:00,639
and to some extent i think of art though

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,639
not all forms of art but many

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,839
so now we have the definition

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,440
definitions down

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,880
i want to start talking about the

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,199
history

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,199
and this is uh so that we can kind of

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,959
discuss the context

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,880
with which this conversation is taking

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,839
place

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,560
and i'm going to be approaching this

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,720
from

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,639
discussion of journalism funding

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,199
journalism

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,160
which is going through patronage to the

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,160
people

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,000
to some extent back to patronage before

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,120
we talk about that model in terms of

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,040
software

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,040
and a broader software ecosystem

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:42,720
so journalism

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,639
sorry about that moving through my

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:49,040
slides a little more quickly

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:51,360
uh journalism was initially funded by

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,880
those who could afford printing presses

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:58,160
these things are by no means

00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,800
cheap uh there were few of them

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,160
and if you wanted to print something you

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,519
had to go to the person with the

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,480
printing press

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,079
they made those decisions yes there are

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,120
legal frameworks that were

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:13,120
brought up to even restrict it more

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,880
but when it came down to it that's what

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,120
happened

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,040
but as time went on the brain presses

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,399
became more affordable

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:26,079
um became more democratized

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,880
some might say and the the funding

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,360
structure

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,320
behind journalism switched to really

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,279
relying

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:37,839
on classifieds and like advertisements

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,399
uh uh rolling back a little bit i'm

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,399
talking

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,839
mostly about journalism in the context

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:46,880
of the united states

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,880
um as i'll touch on momentarily

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,279
as the classified ads became free online

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,399
right as we had uh craigslist and other

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,160
things

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,600
the power was really placed more and

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,040
more and more with just

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,160
advertisers to the point where they

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,720
drive

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,720
the message this gets back to the idea

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,520
of the attention economy

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,520
the idea that

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,720
if you want money if you want to pay

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,480
your journalists you have to run things

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,160
that the advertisers

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,520
will give you money for so that means

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,400
that you're running things that are more

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,039
shocking

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,079
things that are maybe not as as useful

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:30,000
in the traditional

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,000
traditional journalistic form

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,440
now some countries why i was speaking

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,679
about the us here

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:39,440
have actually uh a different model

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,880
they they they state sponsored their

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,840
journalism they state sponsored their

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,400
news

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,160
now uh one that comes to my mind often

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,600
is friends

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,559
and this type of

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,520
sponsorship this type of funding has

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,960
problems

00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:00,080
right there are things you can't say

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,720
if you want to keep your funding

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,440
but it does allow that news to be more

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,520
focused

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,679
on the civic issues on things of the

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:11,600
public interest

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:14,000
because the news isn't being directed it

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,080
does have corners where they don't want

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,400
you to maybe look

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,000
but it and and not that you can't but

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,720
like if you want to keep your funding

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,480
and

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,880
that type of thing but it's not being

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,360
directed in that same sense

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,080
and so if we think about that model

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,559
where it was like

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,000
very directed and then kind of went to

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,400
the people

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,080
and has now moved back to being directed

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,200
versus

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,960
it was very directed and

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,799
instead of moving kind of to the people

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,960
it moves to we may think

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,400
as a larger sense of people the

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,880
government

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,240
and so it doesn't have that direction

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,760
but

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:56,880
um but it

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,360
also is being funded by this large

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,799
entity still

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,760
so that arc i see it in other public

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,919
goods

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,840
and specifically part of why we're here

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:12,000
is i see it in software

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,760
initially software and before we

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,679
even conceptualized it all that

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,679
different as from hardware

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,120
it was funded by universities right the

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,320
idea that graduate students were working

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,280
on these things

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,080
in the military-industrial complex but

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,160
then it was

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,200
freed to what you might think of like

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,720
the public

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,880
though of course most people didn't have

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,200
access to computers or

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,320
the available knowledge to interact with

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,520
it

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,640
but it was freed and these these public

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,200
goods

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,480
were you might say funded through

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,120
development effort

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,480
right there's still the the energy and

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,480
effort going into them

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,960
but it's it's hobbyist we're able to

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,440
interact with them

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:58,880
now as of an ecosystem

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,600
uh floss communities they have to keep

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,799
the lights on

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:07,600
they have to eat pay rent have servers

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,080
and so the developers ended up getting

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,360
hired on by companies more and more

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,320
and that means their efforts do become

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,799
directed

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,080
right they get directed away from flow

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:22,480
projects

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:24,240
because they have to sign clas caas

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,840
they have to work on the majority of the

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,559
time on this project versus the project

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:32,000
they may want to work on

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:34,720
this kind of brings me to uh this uh

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,760
this term that so one of my favorite old

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,039
papers it's called

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,600
cooking pot markets and it was described

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,000
by

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,960
uh sorry from butchery the name but

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,640
rashad

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:49,679
gauche in 1998. the idea is that

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:53,600
the cooking pot is full of public goods

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:55,200
and so when you add more of these goods

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,840
because they're public goods everyone

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,799
can take out without the pot diminishing

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,840
so just growth

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,799
gets better and bigger and richer but

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,960
what's stopping

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,159
floss from growing like we we have

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,559
absolutely grown we do

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,720
see all of these areas where we have

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:15,200
operating systems

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:17,440
we have we have um bios we have uh

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,240
these great graphics programs and there

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:24,799
are some places we're absolutely

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:29,039
doing well but in general

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:30,480
right we're not growing to this

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,200
true point of being able to be

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:36,640
competitive at least in my opinion

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,720
unfortunately i want that now

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,080
what i think the reason is is that the

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,360
ecosystem

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:46,480
of software of free software is actually

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,799
not public goods it's a commons

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,720
and so we need to sustain that ecosystem

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,120
as we would with the commons

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,159
we need to sustain the developers not

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,600
just

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,799
keep putting in public good code

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,280
if you if you don't sustain the

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,919
developers you see these vulnerabilities

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,400
right you see you see heart bleed the

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,480
lack of

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,520
uh the lack of the getting new

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,360
developers get

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:14,960
spending the time spending the money

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:18,000
and and that path towards competing like

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:21,120
truly being competitive

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,120
uh with primary software just i don't i

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,080
don't think that

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,720
it is going to happen unless we start

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,840
worrying about

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,039
just being a commons developers are

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,039
humans

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,440
and in our current system humans need

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,440
funding

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:43,679
of course we do

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,120
live in a society where there's funding

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,159
it exists

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:51,120
uh we're here right we're here at this

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,120
this amazing event

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,400
and part of that is that there are

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,000
people already shoveling

00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,760
in the sense that we'll get to there are

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,360
people who are already

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:07,280
engaging giving of themselves right

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:10,400
we've gotten here but

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,559
really the funding comes from two kind

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,600
of large spaces

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:17,440
i should say three but for what

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,440
what i would consider like good funding

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,200
we have individual funding and we have

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:26,080
institutional funding and then we have

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,200
the thing i would like to avoid more and

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,640
we'll get to

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,640
which is manipulative funding

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:41,360
yes all right

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:43,200
um questions

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,480
i don't see the shared notes because

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,360
that will take me

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,000
out of uh out of the presentation mode

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,120
but i will

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,080
take a look at those after i'm done or

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,720
if you drop them in the chat so let's

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,520
talk about

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,520
individual funding

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,600
the first one is through donations i

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,279
mean this is the traditional

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,880
funding source everyone has and thinks

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,279
about it you know

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,520
can you please make a donation but these

00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:12,880
are often one time

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,200
right and they're they're boundless

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,240
you there's no floor there's no ceiling

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,679
you can give as little or as much

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,279
and that doesn't really connect with the

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,159
project needs

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,559
right the project needs thousand dollars

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,320
to

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:30,000
hire an ad like a ad agency to be able

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:34,159
to produce something

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,960
they they can't get it through like

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,400
asking this is how much we need and

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,120
there's not really this guarantee of

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,720
impact

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,720
there's there's nothing that says that

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,799
if i give my five dollars

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,080
that's going to sustain the project even

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,240
if i give my five dollars a month

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,760
it's not gonna sustain the project

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,880
necessarily

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,000
unless as we get to uh wealthy enough to

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,120
really be getting

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,039
uh load their big

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,799
space in individual funding is newer but

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:06,080
it's become very popular

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:06,080
and that's crowdfunding now crowdfunding

00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,760
is kind of in two camps

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,640
we have the all or nothing one-time

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,559
crowdfunds

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,400
so this is kickstarter

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,000
these are producing something everyone

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,799
working towards a goal getting to the

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,240
goal

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:27,200
and making it happen it's great

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,360
it's good it is going uh well we've seen

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,799
a lot come out of this

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:35,840
the other camp is these ongoing

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,400
pledges but the ongoing pledges are made

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,679
with

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:43,039
a variety of levels that are made with

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:46,320
i'm going to give more than you and

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:49,919
so i get earlier access right

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:53,279
um i get the little extra

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:57,760
trinket and so that's that's of course

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:59,440
like the patreon model but both of these

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,120
lose their effectiveness when it comes

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,720
to public goods because you can't

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,120
exclude people

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,240
right and they're not rivalrous not

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,159
rivals doesn't

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,120
necessarily matter as much with these

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:13,440
but the excludability definitely does

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,960
because both of these you're giving at

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,440
the different levels because you're

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,279
getting something more than other people

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,520
it's not based on because you have more

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:25,039
necessarily

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:27,679
now the other two in this individual's

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,679
funding space

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:40,240
i have my tux tee for my

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,240
teagle txt mug um

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,000
we have pledge drives now pledge drives

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,960
are kind of

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,760
crowdfunding but they're older more

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,960
traditional

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,440
and they're really effective especially

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,720
because they don't have those thresholds

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,400
but they still are like

00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,760
kind of a time-bound thing

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,159
but they require wide-reaching

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,520
communication right the

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,159
i'm sure many of you have listened to

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,600
npr and that annual pledge ride comes

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,120
around

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,799
you've been on wikipedia and you've seen

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,919
the drives they need to hit

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:17,200
a lot of people to to raise

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:20,399
the amounts that they're looking for

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:23,440
and they also are really

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:27,200
maximized when there's this matching

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,880
this idea that um i you know someone's

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,760
very wealthy and i'm gonna match however

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,840
many people

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,440
up to this point and so that really

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,720
attracts people because they know that

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,120
it's not just their money it's

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,559
it's their money and others and so it

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,080
grows faster and

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,320
they're willing to make those little

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,679
gives because again with that wide

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,000
communication network

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,880
they really can kind of have some

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,919
assurance

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,360
that they're making a difference

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,039
the last one's a little different than

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,120
all those other categories and this is

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,240
bounties and commissions this is the

00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,440
idea that

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,679
i'm only going to make progress if

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,520
the price gets paid right which

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,120
restricts creativity because

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,039
now i can only work on the things that

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,840
are being paid for

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:12,640
and uh there's potential for sabotage as

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,520
sad as it is

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,559
i can make things that people will want

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,200
to pay for

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,799
so that they will then pay the bounty

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,039
and i'll work on them

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:26,080
it just hasn't seen that much success uh

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,080
in the broader sense

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,840
i was moving to institutional funding

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,240
with institutional funding

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,640
we have three broad spaces we have

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,520
grants

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,120
which are people and organizations that

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,120
like have all this money

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,520
and they are trying to support the

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,799
social good

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,799
and or avoid taxes

00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,840
that usually comes with restrictive

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,520
terms you can only spend that money on

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,799
certain things

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:07,360
and often it's these large like

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,720
large large funds which you know a

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,320
project that hasn't has been getting

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,840
like five dollars here and there

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,440
suddenly gets ten thousand dollars what

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,640
do they even do with it

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,320
what happens when that ten thousand

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,960
dollars goes away and they've hired

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,399
people

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,159
right do they then have to work more on

00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:23,520
these grants

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,320
there's sponsorships often with direct

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,679
strings

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,360
and again limitations sometimes this is

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,200
indirect this is the idea that

00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,480
you have 20 of your time to work on

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,120
something free

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,520
or that you just have a job so that you

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,520
can

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,799
fund your side projects working on these

00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,799
things

00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:43,120
those provide these subtle influences

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:45,120
sometimes through advertising

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,520
the last one the biggest one the one

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,200
that's like the greatest source

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,720
of public goods funding right now is

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,760
taxes

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,279
uh this has all of the the political

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,640
arguments we could make about

00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:00,399
uh bureaucracies and really it's a lot

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,559
of it comes down to poor distribution

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:06,320
it doesn't go to the projects that are

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,320
needed which leads to underfunding

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:13,679
so the last one

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,159
just touch on here is malicious this is

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,279
what we

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,240
really get to when we talk about uh this

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,960
big divide

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,039
right this is the idea of providing

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:27,360
something for free of charge

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:29,919
in exchange for making you the product

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,799
right they do that through manipulation

00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:36,559
and surveillance

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:38,159
the game can control over the consumer

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,480
so what's being worked on right now all

00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,840
right we're in the snowdrift shirt

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:47,520
pointing to the snowdrift picture uh

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:50,880
clearly involves no drift

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:53,120
well there's a number of things

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,240
first one i want to talk about tide lift

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,440
they're pretty cool

00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:01,600
uh they're approaching this

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,600
challenge of how do you

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,519
give money and support and fund those

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,559
libraries

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:11,600
like ssl how do you how do you

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:14,720
uh fund the stuff that no one sees

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,640
and they do it through basically

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,000
maintaining updates and charging the big

00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,559
companies and projects that are using

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,120
those libraries and then passing that

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:26,640
out and distributing it

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:30,840
there's github sponsors it's been um

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:34,480
it's been discussed somewhat more

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,120
but it's great it's great that you can

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,720
get

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,960
so many people so many eyes on these

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,080
projects because github is this huge

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,840
uh software forge but

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,240
because it's such a huge shop for forge

00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,679
um

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,760
well it uh it

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,200
doesn't necessarily give money to again

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,279
where it's not needed

00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,279
and maybe it disperses it too much and

00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,960
it still has a lot of these problems

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,720
where there's still donations right

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,799
still going into some of these

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:07,120
current models then there's snow drift

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,399
and i'll talk about senator real briefly

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,480
here but then

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,600
there's also tons more uh we actually

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,360
we've compiled

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,720
well we've compiled all the research but

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,000
we've done research on over

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,120
700 of these public goods funding sites

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,240
and it's on our wiki

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,559
and we've compiled hundreds of them um

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:28,399
actually showing it because they were

00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:31,840
more popular more interesting ones

00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:34,480
now snowdrift.com crowd matching for

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,480
public kids

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,600
now snowdrift is uh

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,279
i've been working on this thing called

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,240
crab matching

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,039
the idea of crowd matching addresses

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,919
some of these

00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:55,600
questions and points so each month

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:58,480
you donate you pledge

00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:01,440
the amount you donate is really small

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,559
like 10th of a penny small

00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,799
but it's that number times the number of

00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:10,159
other people who make that same pledge

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:13,279
and so what happens is that

00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,880
as more patrons join you end up giving a

00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:17,440
little more

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,240
and not only do you give a little more

00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,559
but everyone else gives a little more

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,880
because it gets back to that idea you're

00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:28,720
all trying to support the project

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,399
you're all there uh coordinating

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,120
to to really push something forward to

00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:35,039
make something sustainable

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,640
and uh mathematically it's interesting

00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,679
in that the current

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,559
idea behind this has a linear growth in

00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,799
the amount you give

00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:45,519
but a quadratic growth in the amount

00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:48,320
that the project receives

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,720
so we're different as you'd expect as

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,480
far as

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,799
right here part of this community part

00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,799
of why i'm interested in this project

00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,320
we're different because mutual assurance

00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,720
that's the big thing the coordination

00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:01,200
problem that's what we're hidden

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,799
it's ongoing is a subscription type

00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,320
model because it's sustainability is

00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,240
what we care about right we don't just

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,000
want to launch the project we want them

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,359
to actually run

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,320
we want them to be able to hire

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:15,280
full-time developers full-time designers

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,560
we only work for public goods sure the

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,359
model could be and

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,879
and is to some extent our places are

00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,040
trying to work on it but

00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,240
really this is for public goods it's

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,440
addressing a problem

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,599
that doesn't have a good solution

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,119
and i should say we are definitely

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,879
addressing the

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,560
the projects that are more end user

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:38,079
focused projects that

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:40,800
are that uh

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:43,359
things people see and touch and use not

00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,720
necessarily all public goods

00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:47,119
right now you know we've talked a lot

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,960
about this being more software driven

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,480
but we definitely want to support

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,760
journalism research

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,119
art but really it makes sense for public

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,960
goods because of all

00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,520
the things we discussed about what makes

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,800
public goods public goods

00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:04,160
we don't take any fees we are like a

00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,800
free library open source

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,280
software project we we're a public good

00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,599
and

00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,280
we expect to use our own platform to

00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,680
fund ourselves

00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,520
which of course puts us as a nonprofit

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,560
and we

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:21,040
have been cooperatively run

00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,599
operated and in the future that's this

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,359
is

00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,359
the area we work in and care about

00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,440
so i'll make the call for help

00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,480
we need it we've been around for a long

00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,839
time

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,599
and we're still not launched launched

00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,599
we have a ton of technical work we have

00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:43,200
a ton of

00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,720
knowledge work we've done but we don't

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,920
have

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,839
quite enough to get there because we're

00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,640
all volunteers right now right we

00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,960
haven't gone out

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,320
and gotten those grants we haven't gone

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,880
into these uh

00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,520
systems of funding so if you're a

00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,839
developer

00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,960
or if you know developers who are

00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:02,320
interested front end dev

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:04,880
css we're using elm

00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,040
and haskell and happy to talk about that

00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,520
more later

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,560
and that's our back end as well

00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,200
organizational

00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,000
you know it costs money to write terms

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,480
of service

00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,359
uh you know you can copy boilerplate all

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,720
you want but

00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:22,000
we actually care we want them to be

00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,960
understood and reasonable for people

00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,960
could use program managers uh a bunch of

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,720
volunteer cats

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,839
and of course getting all this

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:34,240
cooperative stuff structured is

00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,520
always valuable community i'm the

00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,079
community director by

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,359
title but you know we all wear a lot of

00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:42,160
hats right now

00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:43,680
but you know writing outreach uh

00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,160
moderation of the different

00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,440
communication platforms and channels and

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,040
so we have a how to help page it's a

00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,400
little bit crusty but

00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:54,000
check it out and um

00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,839
here's some of those platforms right we

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,599
have the form we have

00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:01,119
irc and matrix email master on twitter

00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,040
probably end up in other places if we

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:06,560
have more help so

00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:10,079
i do appreciate anyone who can uh

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:12,480
can help out i'm gonna

00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:15,200
almost end here and basically talk about

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,280
what is the future

00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,480
we've talked about these being wicked

00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,119
problems

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,599
wicked problems mean that one approach

00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,560
won't

00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:27,359
suffice to fix them it means that all

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:30,720
these projects need help

00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:32,880
and um there's been some policy pushes

00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,839
more so in europe but i'm i'm really

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,000
excited about them

00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:39,280
it's these ideas that anything that's

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,240
tax funded should be flow

00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,359
the public should own any public goods

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,119
that were created using

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:51,359
public funds i mean that just makes

00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:55,680
sense to me

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:58,720
beyond platforms and projects

00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,960
that are trying to fund uh public goods

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,079
and enable this funding

00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,839
time is one of the most invaluable

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:10,240
resources right valuable and invaluable

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:12,400
people are willingly giving their say

00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,079
right they're shoveling that snow

00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,839
i didn't really touch on the game theory

00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,599
problem about our name

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,119
and shorten time so i won't right now

00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:22,880
but my

00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:24,320
interest and why i've transitioned kind

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,880
of from a practitioner

00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,640
to a researcher it stems from this

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,880
vision

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,760
this vision of what if we're instead of

00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,960
talking about

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:39,440
eight percent 10 12 unemployment

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:43,040
we were considering 60 percent 70 80

00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,200
now covet 19 pandemic it has been

00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,839
a struggle we're at this virtual

00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,839
conference

00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:53,839
and of those struggles unprecedented

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,680
as i'm sure we're all used to hearing

00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:59,040
and now that word

00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,760
levels of unemployment and the economy

00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:04,320
has not yet

00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,320
totally collapsed hopefully won't

00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,240
it's pretty interesting i'm interested

00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,079
in what would look like if we didn't

00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,920
force people back to work

00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,000
would they create public goods would

00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,880
they give more of that time

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,560
and move us towards a big and little f

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,800
free world

00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,320
could this lead to the free software

00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,280
movement utopia

00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,680
that was discussed by stephen martin in

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,160
uh

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,960
20 years ago in milestones on the way to

00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,880
the gpl society

00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,640
i don't know i don't know if the future

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:38,560
is going to be ubi

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:41,839
ubs blockchain economy i'm not sure

00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,880
i do know that i want to believe i want

00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:44,800
believe that we'll be

00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,720
in a more free libre open space than

00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,320
today

00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:52,720
and finally just to close

00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,160
soldier has been active for many years

00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,920
despite not launching

00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,760
we've been deeply engaged with these

00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,599
conversations and topics

00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,119
producing hundreds of pages on our wiki

00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,480
and elsewhere

00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,560
recently we've had this discussion

00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,440
surfacing about our own missions and

00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,160
goals

00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,440
and no decisions have been made but i'm

00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,000
pretty excited for

00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,800
this potential where we consider crowd

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,280
batching just

00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,119
one of many projects and experiments

00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,839
that we think through

00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,480
that we release in a just kind of

00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,480
setting

00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,160
some sort of a group that's thinking

00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,760
deeply about the future of sustainable

00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,200
public goods

00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,680
with that so thank you very much for

00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,280
all of your time really appreciate it

00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,960
and um

00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,400
i do want to shout out to slide carnival

00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,200
and one of my students introduced me

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,599
this

00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,480
uh it's pretty neat everything was

00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,200
released

00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,160
cc by and they don't say that they they

00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,359
say you know it's

00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:52,720
free to use public private commercial i

00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:55,040
went and hunted out is cc by it's great

00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,599
it's great that my students are using cc

00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,280
by

00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:59,280
public flow license stuff

00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:06,560
again siegel november 5th and 6th

00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:10,640
virtual and uh please

00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:12,560
feel free to ask about that and um

00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,560
yeah i i think we have maybe a few

00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:18,240
minutes for questions here

00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:20,000
uh i'm at altsalt.net salt on a lot of

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:23,040
irc matrix places and

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:27,200
uh of course using ccpi

00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:30,160
sa so with that thank you very much

00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,960
um i'm going to click on the shared

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,359
notes and

00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,119
see if it breaks everything thank you

00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,560
very much for your presentation

00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,400
we have two questions for you at the

00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,839
shared notes

00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,480
all right so um the first question here

00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:46,720
is

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:48,800
on yesterday's talk about creta spending

00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,319
hello said that she's uh not so

00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,240
interested in focusing on features

00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:54,640
requested by companies

00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,400
because most don't support the project

00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,440
whereas individual users are more likely

00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,200
to support

00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,960
so what are some funding options where

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,680
more people who are making use of the

00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,240
software

00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,520
get to support the software and that's

00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,839
that's definitely

00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,560
snowdrift is that's exactly what we're

00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:11,760
looking at

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:14,960
um there are a lot of other ones

00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,640
and uh if you go to our wiki and look at

00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,560
i think it's called the market research

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,280
section it talks about other

00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,280
crowdfunding

00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:26,160
projects and there are some that are

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,119
currently active

00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,480
and working i don't wanna just name them

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,839
because uh

00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,760
again looked like over 700 and we've

00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,040
explored why some are better or worse

00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,800
than others

00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,359
the hope is that snowdrift will be the

00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,400
one that i can point you to

00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:45,680
in the very near future and uh the

00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,200
second question here is

00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,920
is what do you think of blender's

00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:52,960
funding model um

00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:55,200
i am not immediately

00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,119
aware of bloody blunders funding model

00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,440
if someone wants to put that

00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,560
either in the notes or chat because i

00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,760
want to

00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,240
research it right here but i know that

00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,280
at least

00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,960
in part blunders been super super

00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,599
successful

00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,119
in uh i think they were like maybe maybe

00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:16,079
the initial crowdfunded

00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:18,240
project like on the internet um they've

00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,720
been super successful in being one of

00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:22,240
the

00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:25,359
more industry like like

00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,000
winners and so i assume that part of

00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:28,640
that funding

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,040
comes from the education around blender

00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,560
and the

00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,760
commercial use of blender and things

00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,839
like that and that's really great

00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,280
for something that's achieved that skill

00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:42,160
and that competitive position

00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,880
but that's not the kind of projects as a

00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,160
whole this is

00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:50,000
the chat here let's see

00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:53,040
um and what uh

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:58,160
open prioritization i am not

00:43:53,040 --> 00:44:02,319
sure uh what this one is

00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:03,920
and let's see if i click on this would

00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:06,560
break everything i always worry a little

00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:10,400
bit about it breaking everything

00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:13,440
um i hit a 404

00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,400
that's because of the markdown i have

00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,880
this issue

00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,400
other sites uh experimenting credit

00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,680
funding to prioritize

00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,240
uh new features uh implementations for

00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,560
browsers

00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,359
so it sounds like a bounty type of

00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,240
system

00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,960
um i have to look into it further i

00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,599
don't

00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,280
think it's on our page yet but it will

00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:36,480
be now

00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,520
and again i think with that we're at the

00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,920
end of the time so

00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,880
thank you so much for having me i hope

00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,280
to

00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,160
see you in the future and uh thank you

00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,160
