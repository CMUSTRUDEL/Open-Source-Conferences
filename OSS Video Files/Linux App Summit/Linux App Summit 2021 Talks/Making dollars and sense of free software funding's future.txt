Title: Making dollars and sense of free software funding's future
Publication date: 2021-05-30
Playlist: Linux App Summit 2021 Talks
Description: 
	Sustainably funding public goods is hard, just ask your local government. We know free software benefits everyone, whether or not users contributed to its development. How then can we reach the world of everyone working on software they love, while making a livable wage? Let's discuss the current funding platforms, where they work, where they don't, and what does free software really need for a sustainable and successful future?

Disclaimer: I am with the team building Snowdrift.coop While we believe that we're addressing some of these questions, we a) aren't there yet, and b) know that there are plenty of unaddressed areas on the way to a free software utopia. This will not just be a pitch for our platform, promise!

Q&A


 1. On yesterday's talk on Krita's funding, Halla said sheâ€™s not so interested in focusing on features requested by companies anymore because most don't support the project, meanwhile individual users are more likely to support the project. What are some funding options where more people who are making use of the software get to support the software?

2. What do you think of Blenders funding model?

3. another "what do you think of" question that I'm curious about is Open Prioritization :-) (https://www.igalia.com/open-prioritization/index)
