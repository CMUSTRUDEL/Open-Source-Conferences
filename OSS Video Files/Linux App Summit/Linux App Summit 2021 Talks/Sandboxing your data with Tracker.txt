Title: Sandboxing your data with Tracker
Publication date: 2021-05-30
Playlist: Linux App Summit 2021 Talks
Description: 
	Tracker is most commonly known for its metadata indexers, but at its core it is powered by the concept of RDF and the SPARQL query language, more common in the web world.

In the pursue to fit a square peg (upfront metadata indexing, globally accessible deduplicated data) in a round hole (selective sandboxed access), the Tracker 3.x core library gained multiple features that make it more suitable for the general purpose of storing data, with built-in distributed and sandboxed characteristics.

In this talk you will learn how a 2010's spec for the web world fixed a desktop problem in 2020's, and how Tracker can be used for private data, distributed (and sandboxed) data exchange between processes, and beyond.

Q&A


 1. Why would I choose Tracker over other SPARQL implementations?

 2. Could I develop KDE software that makes use of Tracker?

 3. What resources are available to learn how to make the most from Tracker and SPARQL?

 4. Is there any successful stories over using such databases? While they seem (are) very powerful, it's use seems limited in the standard desktop usage.
