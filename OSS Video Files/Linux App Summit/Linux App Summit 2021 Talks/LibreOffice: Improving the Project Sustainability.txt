Title: LibreOffice: Improving the Project Sustainability
Publication date: 2021-05-30
Playlist: Linux App Summit 2021 Talks
Description: 
	LibreOffice was announced in 2010 to relaunch innovation of the already stagnant OpenOffice project. After 10 years of growth, it was necessary to review and update the strategy based on the evolution of the office suite market, to improve the sustainability model. In fact, enterprises - although deploying LibreOffice to save money over proprietary solutions - are not supporting the project as much as individual users. Over time, this can represent a threat for the sustainability of the project, as development can be slowed down. We have therefore changed the strategy, to educate enterprises about the right approach to FOSS, by giving back in one of the many available ways: purchase the LTS version from the ecosystem, fund the development of a specific feature, pay for the solution of a bug or a regression, and so on. The right approach from enterprises would ensure the long term sustainability of the LibreOffice project, and the evolution of the Open Document Format (ODF) ISO standard file format for true interoperability.

Q&A


1. With the core being stable and the majority of more complex features being used for business purposes, wouldn't this cause the disconnect/ higher barrier for entry to new casual contributors? (and declining community contributions over time)

We will have a Development Mentor starting soon, in addition to the current Development Marketing activity. We also update regularly Easy Hacks, which allow newcomers to get familiar with the source code.

2. Is it expected that LibreOffice will ever have a development environment like Microsoft Office has with VBA for Excel, for instance?
(@CarlosOliveira)

LibreOffice has StarBasic, but to avoid old unstable and vulnerable languages (Basic has 67 years, and has never been really updated), it supports Python, which is more modern, secure and portable.

3. Is Apache v2 used by google fonts having the same vendor lock-in issue as Microsoft's approach? What would be foss friendly license in this context?

No, font license - if FOSS - is irrelevant, LibreOffice can bundle any FOSS licensed font. Of course, if the font designer allows modifications, the font design cal also be tweaked. Microsoft is not only releasing only proprietary fonts, but is also connecting the fonts with the OS or the software, which means that you are legally allowed to use a font only if you own a license of the OS or the software.

4. Do we have libreoffice.biz (shorter than libreoffice.business)? (Neal Gompa)

Unfortunately, this was already registered by someone else, and we are trying to get it back.

you should hear me now

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,040
yes welcome welcome thank you for being

00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:12,160
here

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:16,080
okay um so i will uh

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,359
i will talk uh today morning everyone i

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,640
will talk today

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,640
to about the

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:27,320
project we started last year about

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,880
improving the libreoffice project

00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,160
sustainability

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,200
uh we

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,160
estimate to have a user libreoffice

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,000
we estimate to have a user base of

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,960
around 200 million people

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
this is based on the number of downloads

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,120
on the

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,879
more or less on the share that we

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,320
estimate to have on the different

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,360
platforms

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,559
we have 90 percent users on windows 80

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,920
8 on mac os and 2 percent of linux

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:02,320
linux is is is growing actually

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,479
uh during last year it has almost

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,840
doubled the number of

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:11,760
of libreoffice users uh but

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,960
before changing our numbers we want to

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,159
have a

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,320
stable situation so we estimate to have

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,799
around 200 million user

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,640
uh half of them are only using

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,320
libreoffice half of them are using

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,360
libreoffice and another office suite

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,960
and when i mention office suite

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:36,799
it is either desktop or cloud

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:40,400
so libreoffice is a cloud version

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,360
and it's exactly the same as the desktop

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,399
version is

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,399
extremely similar

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,680
what how the market has evolved

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,960
before 95 documents had to be printed to

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,799
be shared

00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:01,040
then with internet we started to

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:05,680
shed the digital documents

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,840
and the concept of interoperability was

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,840
born

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,840
um

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,280
around 2005 we had the

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,760
the standards and therefore uh

00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,800
interoperability was

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,760
theoretically improved the problem is

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,120
that

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:28,959
we have one real standard which is odf

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:34,080
and one non-standard which is open of

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,080
office open xml so the microsoft office

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,920
proprietary format it is approved

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,400
by iso but what has been approved has

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,680
never been implemented

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:52,160
um although people

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,800
uh talk about uh desktop productivity

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,640
being

00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:00,080
dead the numbers say that this is not

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,319
true and again when i mention desktop

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,720
the product can the software can be on

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:10,000
the cloud but desktop means

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:14,560
individual productivity in in 2018 when

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,840
ubuntu asked their users which

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,720
desktop application should be there

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,239
you see the uh the amount of people the

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,000
number of people that wanted to have

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,200
libreoffice was amazing

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,879
we was even beyond our best

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,920
guesses and uh

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:37,040
google apps was there since

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,840
almost forever now and although google

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,480
apps was there

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,840
libreoffice got around 80 percent of the

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,360
choices

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,680
um the the

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,239
actually uh we are talking about a

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,599
mature product

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:57,040
but a product that is not declining uh

00:03:53,599 --> 00:04:00,239
and one thing that is uh probably

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,799
uh adding interest is the

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,080
attention for digital sovereignty it is

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,400
now clear

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,519
uh not only because we talk about that

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,599
but also

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,959
because the authorities start to

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,639
understand

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,040
and to realize that to to to

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,560
protect our digital sovereignty which

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,639
basically means

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:27,759
the ability of managing

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,320
uh what we share with our computers

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,520
and uh owning what we share with our

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,720
computers

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:38,000
uh the the format of files is uh

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:41,120
uh is key uh and uh

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
unfortunately they have not they didn't

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,280
give it

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,560
enough attention and this uh happens in

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,600
more or less in everywhere in the world

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,759
we have uh small exceptions the biggest

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,000
one being uh

00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:01,360
the uh state of taiwan

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,720
but in europe the situation is

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,759
unfortunately

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,120
very quite bad

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:13,199
if we look at the the market

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:16,479
and the revenues you see that in 2021

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:20,479
they still have a solid 25 billion

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:23,759
dollars and in 2025

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:27,199
is expected to reach

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:30,800
billion dollars of course it is clear

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:33,280
that uh when we speak about billions of

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,280
dollars

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,360
there is a lot of attention there and

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,800
the people

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,759
the companies that own a fair share of

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,000
that market

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,520
do whatever they can to protect it and

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,639
when i say

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:52,479
whatever they can i mean they

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,680
lobby with authorities to protect their

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,880
market share

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,080
and they do whatever tricks they can

00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,759
with a format

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,000
to avoid interoperability

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,120
interoperability basically

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,680
doesn't kill the market kills the market

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,440
shares

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,680
and this is

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,080
the projected growth that you see is

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,840
around rather stable around

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:23,440
five percent increase uh year over year

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,440
until 2025.

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,240
when we launched libreoffice our model

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,240
was to

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:35,039
have a foundation and

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,199
an ecosystem around the foundation so

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,600
the foundation would provide

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,280
the uh represent the community and

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,560
provides the governments on the

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,560
trademarks

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,560
but it's not releasing uh

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:54,160
commercial product uh so we

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,160
release only the what we call the

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,840
vanilla version of

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,240
libreoffice which is the

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,880
reference version and around that there

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,759
are

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:10,400
companies in the ecosystem that produce

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,360
release software which is optimized for

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,360
enterprises

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,000
our stakeholders are community members

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,440
and

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,880
the companies that add value to the

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,759
project

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,039
and we have a lot of users stakeholders

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,680
and

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,479
they either they don't have any

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,560
involvement

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,080
because they use a free product which is

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,800
absolutely fair

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,400
or they have a very low uh they give the

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,759
product a very low value

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,039
because uh office without a commodity

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:49,120
and these us over the last 10 years

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,879
this trend to reduce the value

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,160
per the perceived value of office

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,160
readers increased

00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:01,680
so today based on the data that we can

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:05,440
extract from our sources so from

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:09,039
git we see that 68

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:12,000
of all the code is developed by com by

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:15,039
developers that are paid by a company

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,960
active in the ecosystem

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:20,720
and volunteers are releasing 28 percent

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,360
of code

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,240
on the contrary uh 90 percent of

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,800
donations are from individuals

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,479
and around 10 percent from small and

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,760
medium businesses

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:36,320
but only less than 5 percent of

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,919
enterprise users contribute in any way

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,279
to the project

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,599
and they can contribute by

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,680
sponsoring that they could contribute by

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,399
sponsoring developers by

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,120
of course buying a long-term supported

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:55,360
version from an ecosystem company

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,279
they can sponsored the solution of bugs

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,399
or the development of new features

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:04,240
this is actually what happens most of

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:07,360
the the companies that are uh

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,240
the enterprises that are supporting the

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,200
project

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,600
at the moment are either paying

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,720
developers also paying companies

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:20,320
to have a bug sold or

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,320
feature developed no one or very a tiny

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,519
tiny tiny fraction

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:30,880
is uh buying an lts version

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:34,160
and this uh over the the long term

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,519
uh would create a problem

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:41,519
for the sustainability of libreoffice

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,560
um of course the the sustainability

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,600
issue is not

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,959
just a libreoffice issue

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:52,000
uh we basically discovered uh

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:55,920
the how bad the the issue could be

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,440
in 2014 when the art bleed bug was

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,399
discovered

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,200
and after that there were some research

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,880
uh

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:08,399
the most interesting and the most uh

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,519
accurate about that was uh nadia ekbal

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,399
research

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,279
uh sponsored by the fourth foundation uh

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,000
and uh

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,680
the paper is uh the title of the paper

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
is roads and bridges

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,440
the unseen labor behind our digital

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,040
infrastructure

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:28,160
in 2019 dries built-it

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:31,279
the the leader of the

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,399
uh ah sorry

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:37,440
uh dd akuya and the

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,680
um owner and uh

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,040
i don't remember the name of the cms at

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,000
the moment sorry

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,160
uh publisher blog posts balancing makers

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and takers to scale and sustain open

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,240
source

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,839
drupal is the drupal leader

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:59,519
and these are a few excerpts

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:03,680
from his blog and i think that

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:06,880
rhys summarizes very well the

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,680
the concept there are makers and there

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,120
are takers

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:16,320
and if the takers are

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,320
too many or become two

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,320
unbalanced uh with takers

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,600
they can arm open source project and

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,440
they

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,600
can induce the makers to be having a

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,440
more selfish

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:36,720
manner what is happening in fact

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:42,720
is that after this problem uh

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:46,160
we have seen uh a number of the the

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,839
relicensing of uh open source project

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,680
uh to avoid the use of these open source

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,800
project by

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,279
large corporation we at libreoffice we

00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,639
don't think that this is

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:03,920
a good solution we

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:08,000
want to stay loyal to our copyleft

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,399
license we do not want to go open core

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,519
which is another solution which would be

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,480
to have a

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,920
uh a version a stripped-down version for

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,720
the community and a

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,839
full featured version for the for the

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,560
companies

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,240
we want to have a single version and we

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,959
would like to have the companies the

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,240
enterprises behave in a

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:33,360
correct way with us so

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,959
uh going back uh

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:41,279
when we launched uh this was uh

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:44,079
what the summary of our announcement

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,160
and the the objective were to relaunch

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:49,519
the innovation at the time libra

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:52,959
open office was uh close to that

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,120
it is close to that that today but

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,959
apache software foundation doesn't seem

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,120
to realize this

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,560
but the problem is that at that time the

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,560
risk of

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:07,760
the project being abandoned was very

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:11,200
big so the community

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,720
backed by several companies took control

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,600
of the product

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,600
and we

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,560
wanted to relaunch the innovation and

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,560
develop a self-sustaining project

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,040
basically open office

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,120
was not completely self-sustaining

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:31,839
because there was a large

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:34,880
sun investment behind it we wanted to

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,959
change the structure of the project and

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,959
uh

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:43,120
basically we decided to have a

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,120
the balance between community and

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,320
ecosystem that there was

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,639
mentioning before without we we didn't

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,360
want to have a single corporate sponsor

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,639
or

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,160
to tweak the license to make the project

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,600
sustainable

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,639
uh so this is what the document

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,959
foundation is

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,839
doing the document foundation is the

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,199
foundation

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:10,000
behind libreoffice

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:12,800
and after 10 years we can say that the

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,600
document foundation has

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,000
reached the objective is recognized as a

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,240
leading

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,040
force foundation uh we have established

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,839
the libreoffice brand name although we

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,279
still have the

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,800
open office issue around uh

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,959
because many people are using

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,320
libreoffice and calling it open office

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,680
just because

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,560
the the the

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,360
change resistance to change even in the

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,360
name is

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:47,279
is incredibly high but the problem is

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:50,000
that uh looking at these figures so

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,800
development the last two years as i said

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
enterprise uh develop enterprise

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:59,680
sponsored development was 68

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,800
uh volunteer is 28

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:06,000
and of course volunteers are fundamental

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:09,120
uh but they are not

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,959
alone they are not enough to sustain

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:16,000
the project at the pace that the users

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:18,320
expect the project to to go forward to

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,680
program to make progress

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:25,279
and if we look at contribution

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:28,320
these of course are raw numbers

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,560
they should be explaining in in in

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,839
in a larger amount of time but let's say

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,639
that

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,000
in terms of people there are around 50

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:40,480
core contributors

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,800
110 regular contributors

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:48,720
and a larger number

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,720
of casual contributors

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,560
of course if you look at the casual

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,199
contributors the community

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,839
is a lot bigger for instance we have 4

00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:01,600
000 people active in localization

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:05,120
but you know keeping track of

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,120
everything would be really

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:12,160
difficult we are trying to improve

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,040
in localization at the time is not fully

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,240
represented

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,480
in this chart but this gives an idea

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,560
more or less of the numbers

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:25,759
and you see the in term of commits uh

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:29,120
which is the difference uh of course

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:32,639
this uh is not to say that

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:36,560
uh core is better than uh

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:39,680
casual uh contributors but tells you

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,560
that we need to have a

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,519
a number of core contributors that are

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,560
paid

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:51,040
to make it absolutely

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:55,199
sustainable so at the moment

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:57,680
uh the

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,040
basically developed pay-by-consistent

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,920
companies

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:05,360
uh is are a very large portion of that

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,839
78 percent of core contributions

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,880
and without the contribution from the

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,319
ecosystem

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,799
uh we libreoffice would have issues in

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:18,720
keeping up with user expectations so

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:21,199
what we we say we want

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,199
we

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,079
we looked at at the background

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:31,440
uh in the first four years there was a

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:34,320
growth of the ecosystem companies

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,679
we went from 20 to 60 full-time paid

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,400
developers

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,720
then we started to lose some ecosystem

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,919
companies the number of paid developers

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,200
shrinked

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:48,480
now is stable but it should grow

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,600
back again uh

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,240
we we had several development cycles

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,240
now we are at seven basically we think

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,320
that the product is mature

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,520
we don't need to focus the development

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:04,400
cycle on a specific

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,480
area like it was for the first four

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,600
development cycles

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,840
we are working at improving

00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,120
interoperability

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,240
user interface solving bugs developing

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,679
features but

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:23,360
there is not a single area where we are

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:23,360
taking care the problem is that

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,480
the ecosystem is not growing as much as

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,760
the community

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,760
we the the

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,600
relationship between the ecosystem and

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,200
community are not ideal

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,000
because there are some community members

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,559
that

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,480
look at ecosystem company in a negative

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,799
way and this is not

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:52,240
good and

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:54,400
with the young contributors coming in

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,000
and a large number of community members

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,200
is not aware of the

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,360
root of the background of the project

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,200
and they provide enthusiastic

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,320
contribution but in some cases they

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,440
create frictions

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,120
as well so the the issue is that we we

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,240
have to work together

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,280
to develop the strategy for a next

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,000
decade

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,400
that guarantees and bring libreoffice to

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,919
to

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:22,240
to everyone uh

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,440
at the moment libreoffice is the only

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,160
viable

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,320
free open source software alternative to

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:32,160
microsoft office

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:35,280
we are at the crossroad of the

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,679
force ecosystem if you look at this

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,760
the project at the mo at the time as a

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,400
large community there are volunteers

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,280
there is an

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,600
ecosystem there is a large overlap

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:49,280
between volunteers and ecosystem

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,360
many uh people employed by ecosystem

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,440
companies are also contributing as

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,760
volunteers in other areas

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,760
for instance they may be translating the

00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,200
interface in their

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:05,360
native language they can organize events

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:08,960
uh there is quite a lot of overlapping

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:13,120
and if you look at the at the different

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:17,200
uh the the entire uh

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:21,039
fourth world we we are basically

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:24,159
more or less in the center because we

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,600
we get we have a little bit of a

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,400
foundation

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,080
we have a little bit of traditional

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,679
software companies and

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:37,280
we have integration support and so on

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:39,919
so libreoffice is uh

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,799
we think is a is is a key product for

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,799
the

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,880
open source ecosystem it is a key

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:48,400
product for the linux ecosystem

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:51,919
our objective is to provide

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:56,080
the best free open source office suite

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:58,400
uh we want to

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,400
improve our marketing by underlying in

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,960
the peculiarities of the libreoffice

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,799
project

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:08,480
we are there is a big effort in

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:13,280
producing uh marketing materials i will

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:16,640
cover that in after so

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,640
uh the the unique selling proposition of

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,320
libreoffice is the best open source

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,360
office with ever

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:26,240
backed by a strong community is

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,200
providing the standard document format

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,520
for interoperability but as also

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,840
providing a superior compatibility with

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,200
proprietary document format and believe

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,360
me

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:43,039
being compatible with office open xml

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:46,159
is incredibly difficult because they

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:48,559
are doing uh as much as they can to

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,320
to make the mission this emission

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,120
impossible

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,919
uh we provide the best of open source

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,919
with

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,080
professional open so professional

00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:03,200
support

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,200
for enterprises and also

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:09,600
optimize activities to

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:12,320
for managing strategic business content

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,320
for the enterprises that want to

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,240
use libreoffice for that and there are

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,600
governments using uh

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:22,240
libreoffice for uh their uh

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,679
objectives so uh libreoffice can be a

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,840
strategic tool

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,840
and is a strategic tool for many

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,919
the next nes uh what are we doing so

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,480
we have developed the concept of

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:41,360
libreoffice technology basically

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,840
libreoffice has evolved from a single

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,080
product to a platform

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,240
for the development of different

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,640
solutions which are

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:54,240
free open source solutions and are

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:57,039
targeted to different public

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,360
the fact that we have a single platform

00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,440
for

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:03,200
all of this represents an advantage over

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,559
other software because they have a

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,080
different platform

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:12,000
for every different public

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:14,080
and even for every different application

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,919
we have to reduce the perception that

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,960
the document foundation is a software

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,000
vendor

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:23,600
because people think that we provide

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,640
support and other services we do not

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,200
we are not for profit so we

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,320
cannot sell and basically we cannot sell

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,159
anything

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:37,440
apart from some swags or some

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:40,480
marketing materials

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:43,919
we have to communicate better

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,919
and more in a more coordinated way

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,960
to make it easier for users to

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,200
understand

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,080
which is the best libreoffice version

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,240
for their needs

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:57,840
so we have to make enterprises aware

00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,159
that the libreoffice version released by

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,360
the document foundation might not might

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,200
not be

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:07,200
the best solution for them on one case

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,840
yes they would have a free completely

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,400
free product on the other end they would

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,440
not have a professionally supported

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,960
product

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:20,000
professionally supported in terms of

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,960
support availability volunteers cannot

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,480
be

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:27,760
cannot provide support 24 hours by seven

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,480
cannot provide support every day of the

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,880
year

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,960
uh they have their families they have

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,360
they they basically

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,320
work according to the schedule while

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,840
enterprises

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:42,400
want a service a full service

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,400
support

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:51,440
what about libreoffice technology uh

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:53,760
same processing engine for all modules

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,440
uh the source code has been re cleaned

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,840
and refactored

00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,080
we have a very high good quality and

00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,679
consistency

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:07,120
we have apis that make it easier

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:10,480
than in the past of course to

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,480
develop product

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,799
we have devel we have a web page about

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:20,720
libreoffice technology

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:22,799
uh we have a white paper that explains

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:27,120
what it is so basically

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:29,760
this uh image uh summarize the advantage

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,919
as you see in the case of libreoffice we

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:35,520
have a common productivity engine

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,840
we have the same open document format

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,799
for

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:43,679
every uh for every

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:46,000
single application then we have desktop

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,039
application each one with his own

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:54,320
user interface we have mobile platforms

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:57,440
we have uh tablets with smartphones

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,600
and then we have cloud platforms and the

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,240
user interface is different but it's

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,240
only the user interface is different if

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,440
you look at the other software

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,720
both proprietary and open core

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,279
they have a different engine for

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,360
each platform so they have a word

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,919
processing engine for the desktop

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,679
a word processing engine for mobile and

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,679
a word processing engine

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,679
for the cloud and then they have a

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:27,520
different format

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:30,640
for on on each platform yes

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:33,679
the extension is the same but

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,919
again yes the format is completely

00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:39,760
different then believe me

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:43,279
it can be dramatically different

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:45,760
in terms of xml

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,400
syntax behind it and this makes of

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:52,279
course

00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:54,799
interoperability more challenging and uh

00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:56,080
interoperability for users more

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,080
challenging

00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,440
and interoperability for software

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,360
developers

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,360
a really difficult mission

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:10,559
so uh we went from product to platform

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,679
today we have a libreoffice for the

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,760
desktop

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,600
libreoffice long-term supported

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,480
optimized for enterprises

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,240
for the desktop libreoffice online for

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,880
the cloud libreoffice mobile

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,640
for android and ios and libreoffice for

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,919
chrome os

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,440
all these products are from different

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,880
organization

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,840
but share the same engine so they they

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,840
can have

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,120
a different name for instance on the

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:45,200
cloud you have a

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:47,840
collabora office online

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,080
but the engine is the same so

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,520
consistency of format

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:56,640
is absolutely the same

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,720
of course on linux phone i'm trying to

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,320
look at questions on linux phone you can

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,279
use

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,760
libreoffice for the desktop it works we

00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:08,159
have seen

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,159
on the

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,120
linux phone that have been released

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,480
libreoff is working of course the user

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:21,600
interface is not optimized

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:25,039
some some tweaks

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:27,679
have to be applied and we expect in this

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:30,240
case that the provider of the optimize

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,279
the distribution for linux desktop is

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,880
doing this

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:38,880
anyway the source code is free

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:42,080
so it's up to people also to

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,080
provide these tweaks

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,600
what we have done to go from product to

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,520
platform

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,520
uh we

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,240
we work on document interoperability

00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,799
these are example

00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,799
visual example of challenging

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:08,480
documents and one is the original

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,640
document and the other one is exported

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,200
by libreoffice

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,880
of course uh there are still corner

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,159
cases where the product

00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,720
the so the the document opens in a in a

00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:23,360
completely different way first thing to

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:27,120
do is to look at the fonts

00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:29,760
fonts can be misleading you can have the

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,880
the the the visual appearance completely

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,399
different

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:38,080
but the contents are all there and uh

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:40,640
of course fonts are a locking

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,880
component are a component of the locking

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,520
of microsoft locking strategy

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,919
is not by chance that today that we have

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,120
that

00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:51,120
that the open source world provides a

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,240
working solution

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,960
for to replace calibri cambria in

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,159
console

00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:01,279
consoles and so on microsoft

00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,679
has announced that they will deprecate

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,120
those

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,240
fonts and they will create brand new

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:11,360
fonts

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:14,320
for windows and for microsoft office

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,679
so that we will have to create new open

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,559
source phones that are

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,080
metrically compatible with the new funds

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,880
and i don't think that this

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,960
is just by chance calibri in one sense

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,520
was a very nice font

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,559
we have carlito that reproduce calibri

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,679
but now calibri

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:34,720
will be deprecated and uh

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:37,279
i don't think that this is a coincidence

00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:40,080
this is done on purpose because

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,760
the the fact that fonts were available

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,720
for interoperability has

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:47,279
reduced the number of issues that users

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,799
were facing when

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,760
opening uh document created for instance

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:56,640
with calibri

00:30:51,760 --> 00:31:01,200
on windows we do round trip tests for uh

00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:04,399
all the all the documents there is

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,640
if you happen to open a document a

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,120
microsoft office document that doesn't

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,240
open

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,799
perfectly um

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,399
in most cases there is a workaround

00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:17,120
there is a solution first

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,720
again look at the fonts but the

00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:22,399
interoperability

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,399
should be there

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,399
a little bit about open document format

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,200
is independent

00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,840
interoperable neutral perennial many

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,399
advantages

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:36,240
um software based on libreoffice

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:39,679
technologies available as a

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,720
as i said from many different companies

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,000
i have uh

00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:47,279
added some names here

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,440
look if you want to get it from the

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,039
windows store from the apple store look

00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,240
for the company name

00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:57,760
you will find a libreoffice place

00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:01,279
solution if it is

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:04,399
sorry if you have to pay for it

00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:07,760
on the windows store on on the apple

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:10,640
store it's not because i want we we

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,000
we we want money from you is the problem

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,200
is that maintaining

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,399
that product on the store has a very

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,840
high cost and the the company has to

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:24,080
cover

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:27,360
that cost so what we decided to do

00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:30,640
we added the community

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:33,919
labeled to libreoffice released by

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,320
the document foundation uh it is not

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,279
that doesn't mean it is an open core

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,000
product

00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:41,200
that libreoffice community has exactly

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,320
the same features

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:48,559
of any other libreoffice

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:52,159
software we do not release

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:56,399
software with different features so

00:32:52,159 --> 00:33:00,480
what can happen is that uh

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:04,399
there are features that are developed

00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:06,799
that are developed and paid by a company

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,240
and there might be a version of

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,120
libreoffice released

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,480
by the company that has developed that

00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,000
features

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,840
uh for instance collaboration which are

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,880
the two biggest one

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:24,159
that for uh a few months

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:27,440
offers that feature just because

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:30,799
it has not been merged on on the main

00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:33,440
repository but this is just a case

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,080
it's not for all feature and can only

00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,120
happen

00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:40,559
in some cases where the feature was big

00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:43,919
and was not easy to develop and

00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:47,519
it has to be tested then we have

00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:51,120
the libreoffice enterprise umbrella name

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:54,159
from ecosystem members at the moment

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:57,440
it is not widely used but

00:33:54,159 --> 00:34:01,120
that means that libreoffice enterprise

00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:03,640
is professionally supported if a company

00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:07,519
wants a

00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:09,599
24x7 support cannot expect this from

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:13,280
on libreoffice community they have to

00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,280
look at libreoffice enterprise

00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,359
so these are this clarifies a little bit

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,280
about

00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:23,599
the versions and the users

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,560
of course you can use libreoffice

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:29,760
community on a large migration but then

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:33,040
do not ask to have your

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,960
bag sold in one day because this will

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,879
not happen

00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,560
libreoffice community is supported with

00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:40,960
donations

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,320
unfortunately there are many many many

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,240
free riders with that

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,000
version many universities many

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,679
government organizations many

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
enterprises

00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,200
that number should really should be

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,760
reduced

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,440
we know that we there will always be

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,920
some free riders

00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,079
but we cannot have 95 percent of free

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,400
riders and five percent of

00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,000
enterprises develop the project that's

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,119
not fair

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,040
for the five percent it's not fair for

00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:13,359
the project

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:14,640
uh and uh libreoffice enterprise is a

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:18,480
product for purchase

00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:22,000
the the the price is not comparable

00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:25,520
with the microsoft office price uh

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:29,839
it is a typical open source

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:32,240
uh commercial open source

00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,240
price

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,440
again this to make it clear that

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,720
libreoffice enterprise is

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,000
not a new product it's just a family

00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,200
name to associate to

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,720
make it easier to associate this with

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:53,440
the ecosystem companies

00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,480
how we support libreoffice enterprise we

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,280
have a

00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,000
web page we have improved the download

00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,400
page

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,760
we have a linkedin page libreoffice

00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,520
enterprise

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,119
we will relaunch the brofist

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:09,200
certification

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:10,400
with specific attention for libreoffice

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,720
enterprise

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,640
we have registered business oriented

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,440
domains at the moment they are

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,920
redirecting but in the future there will

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,960
be specific page there

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,839
uh that's the business web page

00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,560
that the libreoffice download you see we

00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:29,040
have a

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,880
business users click here and only

00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,000
because we are the business business

00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,119
user

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,760
click here we add up the the

00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,000
the number of clicks to for the

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,520
libreoffice enterprise page

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,680
was multiplied by 10. so in many cases

00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:51,440
just a fact of not being informed

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:53,599
this is linked in libreoffice enterprise

00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,040
this is the libreoffice certification

00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,280
page

00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:00,240
if you are supporting libreoffice look

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,640
at the certification we are

00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,640
about

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:09,839
we would like to certify you to make it

00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,839
wider

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:18,720
this is what we are doing in terms of

00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:22,000
summary we will

00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:25,599
launch an education campaign specific

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,359
about sustainability of

00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:34,320
libreoffice of open source

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:37,920
project this will probably start in

00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:41,280
in in june with interviews podcast

00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,000
thank you for listening uh and uh

00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:47,119
i will look at the question now to see

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,079
if there is something that i can answer

00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:52,800
uh why is not fair for the the to the

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:55,920
five percent not to pay for libreoffice

00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:59,359
because if you are an enterprise

00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:02,160
and therefore you replace a product

00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:04,960
like microsoft office and you pay

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:07,760
hundreds of euros

00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,079
every year for each user i don't think

00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:14,480
it's fair for the five percent that

00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:17,520
pays for the and the development of

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:20,720
the enterprise features

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:24,160
to uh not to support at all

00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,880
uh the free libreoffice so you can uh if

00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,040
you if you

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,160
for instance if you don't you don't want

00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,359
to

00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:34,400
uh to to pay for uh

00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:37,280
solving bugs or developing features

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:40,320
fair enough you can buy the long-term

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:43,839
supported version from a company

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:46,960
and by paying

00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:50,320
those few euros per seat per

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:53,760
year you will allow

00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:55,760
that company to invest the time of their

00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,800
developers in the development

00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,839
of features in the development

00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,839
in solving bugs

00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,079
what we say is is that we completely

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,400
understand

00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:11,200
and the fact that we are not changing

00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,200
the license

00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:19,359
is that we do not want uh

00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:21,680
we do not want to change

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,400
the license to make it permissive to

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,920
make it

00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,320
we want to stay copy left and this of

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,599
course

00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:33,440
brings with it a number of free riders

00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:37,359
of the uh or if you want takers

00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:43,440
of the libreoffice product uh

00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:47,280
but we don't uh want uh

00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:49,359
we don't want to uh allow companies for

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,480
instance by going with a permissive

00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:54,000
license

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:57,200
to make it proprietary in the future uh

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,320
because that is uh what exactly what we

00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,599
find it when we

00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:03,440
we decided to to create libreoffice and

00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,520
it's not by chance

00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,440
that open apache open office has a

00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:11,359
permissive license this is what

00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:13,040
ibm wanted because they wanted to kill

00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:14,640
libreoffice and they thought that a

00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,319
permissive license could kill

00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:20,079
libreoffice

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:22,240
so we don't see any other license

00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:25,359
then a copy left license at the moment

00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:28,800
we are mozilla public license and

00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:31,520
lgpl uh

00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,480
we would like to have more enterprises

00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,680
to support

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,400
the product we want to use some moral

00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:41,280
situation we want to use some education

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,839
we don't want to use other means that

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,240
are

00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,280
restrictive because that is not would

00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,839
not be

00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,960
free open source software this would be

00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,359
an excuse

00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,440
to have the free open source software

00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:56,240
would be an excuse

00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,359
for a commercial strategy and that is

00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,960
not what we want

00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:04,400
we want to stay loyal to our

00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:07,520
uh open source principle to

00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:11,920
our software freedom principles

00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:15,680
and that is what we really look forward

00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,680
of course we know that it's not easy

00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,480
and uh we

00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:29,520
and we really don't want to

00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:35,119
uh change our license

00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:38,319
uh so

00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:40,800
why we did we took the decision uh it

00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,720
this is uh sorry but it's off topic but

00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,640
i will answer that

00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:51,119
uh because we think that

00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:54,319
the way that free software foundation

00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:57,920
is behaving is not transparent at all

00:41:54,319 --> 00:42:02,480
in terms of governance and

00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:06,400
we expect and what they've done after uh

00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:09,599
the all the comments have been raised

00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,839
is not personal to richard stolman is

00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,680
not personal to anyone

00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:15,760
the problem is that we think that the

00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,640
free software foundation if they want to

00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,800
be

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,640
the steward of free software they should

00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:25,599
start to be transparent

00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:31,200
to have a a a democratic

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:34,240
election methodology or process

00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:37,280
uh they people that are the

00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:40,400
right of vote either they are everyone

00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,079
or no one but it should not be just a

00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:46,079
friend of someone

00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:50,079
like this today and uh so uh

00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:53,200
we at for the time being until we

00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:56,480
do not see a change in

00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:58,400
a real change in uh

00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,760
in the governments at free software

00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,720
foundation

00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,440
uh we will not this is not going to

00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:08,319
change

00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,319
we will we keep it monitored as that

00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,760
our board i'm not a member of the

00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,359
document foundation board

00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:20,960
but what the board has decided is to

00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:24,079
re-evaluate the position every six weeks

00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,040
which means every month and a half based

00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:30,640
on what

00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:30,640
the free software foundation is doing

00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:38,640
and uh yes some some people

00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:42,079
have already answered my

00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,200
some of the questions uh we do not have

00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:46,160
a

00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:49,760
contributor license agreement but again

00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:53,359
we do not want to go permissive

00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:56,560
it's not because we because we

00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:57,359
open office uh other contributor license

00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,640
agreement

00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:03,520
and a permission copy left license

00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,680
we want we do not want to have a

00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,760
contributor license agreement and we

00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,440
want to have a copy left license full

00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,880
stop

00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:16,240
so no permissive and no other licenses

00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:20,000
and i think i'm done in terms of timing

00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:23,680
and i've also answered some question

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,480
i don't know if uh how the organizers

00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:28,720
would like to manage this i'm done for

00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,720
the

00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:35,200
