	A New Look Into APIS - Graphene by Syrus Akbary

REST API's have been with us a long time. It's time to ask if we can create better API's with new paradigms. We will discuss new ways to query and manipulate data so that our code becomes simpler and easier to scale.

GraphQL is a query language created by Facebook in 2012 which provides a common interface between the client and the server for data fetching and manipulations. We will do a quick overview of GraphQL and focus later on Graphene, the main GraphQL framework for Python.

Graphene allows us to reuse our existing Django Models to create schemas quickly and easily. We would like to think of it as the next natural step from the Django Rest Framework.
