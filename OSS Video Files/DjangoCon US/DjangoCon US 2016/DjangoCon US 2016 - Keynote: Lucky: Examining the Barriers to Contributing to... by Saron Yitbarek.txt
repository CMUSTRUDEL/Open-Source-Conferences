00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,130
find their way under trying to find some

00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,270
sort of support to help them on their

00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,640

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,550
actually happen last time I gave a talk

00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,959
in Australia someone said oh you put

00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:24,180
your hair up and we just couldn't find

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,800
you so I'll leave it out for you all but

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,120

tell me what you think and we can have

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:36,800
lots of great conversations so two years

00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,630
ago I had my very first podcast

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,980
interview it was for a show called Ruby

00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:44,160
rogues show hands if you've heard of

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,320
Ruby Rose it's a great really great

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,480
podcast that's been around for many

00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,220
years I think about 5 or 6 years and I

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,410
was brought on to talk about my journey

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,510
learning to code and the episode was

00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,430
called hacking education and so in that

00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,080
process I'm telling them how I was

00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,360
inspired to get into tech by the Steve

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,310
Jobs book and how I learned to code for

00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,140
a couple months on my own and then got

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:07,170
very frustrated decided to go to a boot

00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:11,040
camp and as I'm talking I mentioned in

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:12,830
passing that I am very privileged and I

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,410
said this to a panel of four white men

00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:18,420
and I look like this so naturally they

00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,970
were very confused and one of the

00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,800
panelists Dave actually said I can't

00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:25,590
believe that we had a person on the show

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,570
that's at five four or five levels of

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,280
intersection

00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:32,320
has just claimed to be privileged and

00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,380
that comment stuck with me for a long

00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,480
time I spent a lot of time trying to

00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:40,180
understand how people get to where they

00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,860
are I have my own podcast as coach I

00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,090
mentioned that couldn't be podcast new

00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,460
episodes every Monday you should totally

00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,170
subscribe and my favorite part about

00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,660
this podcast is I get to interview

00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,970
people at all different skill levels and

00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,400
I get to peel back their layers and I

00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,260
get to uncover their stories we've had

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,370
awesome people on the show hopefully you

00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,190
recognize at least one of these people

00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,840
adrian is in the audience and most of

00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,490
these people are college-educated they

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,650
come from many different backgrounds and

00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,240
as I'm interviewing them really what I'm

00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,130
trying to get to is their origin story

00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,260
how do they get to where they are what

00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:13,990
role did things like privilege has to do

00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,600
with their success and what I found so

00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:19,450
interesting about David's comment to me

00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,540
was that his Duchin definition of

00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:24,610
privilege was very different from mine

00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:28,030
his focus very much on race and gender

00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:30,250
which often means it's focused on racism

00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,810
and sexism which makes sense a lot of

00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,550
the conversations we have around

00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,680
privilege are based on racism and sexism

00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,300
and these are two very important topics

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,130
we have to tackle these to make sure

00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,660
that our communities are Python

00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,970
communities our tech emeriti in general

00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,520
are welcoming kind and inclusive places

00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,320
and there are many examples where it is

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,020
not as nice as we would like them to be

00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,630
a recent example is the story of Jesse

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:55,840
frazzle who were used to work at docker

00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:57,520
and an article came out a couple months

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,380
ago that said that one of docker star

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,360
engineers got so many death and rape

00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,430
threats that the company hired private

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,890
detectives to protect their you imagine

00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:10,840
that your company's hiring private

00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:12,280
detectives to keep you safe I'm gonna

00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,080
give you an official trigger warning is

00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,240
the next thing I'm about to say is very

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,240
heavy and this is from a blog post that

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,860
she wrote about a year ago and it says

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,480
ever since I started speaking in

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,640
conferences and contributing to open

00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,010
source projects I had been endlessly

00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,560
harassed I've gotten hundreds of private

00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:31,990
messages and IRC and emails about sex

00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,670
rape and death threats people emailing

00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,530
me saying they jerked off to my

00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:37,370
conference talk video you're welcome by

00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:40,040
the way as we appreciate the sass

00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:42,080
is mild in comparison to sending

00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:45,080
photoshopped pictures of me covered in

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,990
blood I wish I could do my job something

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,810
I very obviously love to do without any

00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:53,800
of this however that seems

00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,800
impossible at this place

00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:59,090
she tweeted when she left and said I

00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,979
lost something I loved so much and a

00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,690
small piece of my soul standing up for

00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:06,910
myself but I just don't know if it was

00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:09,500
right so when we talk about privilege

00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:11,570
the way I think about it is that it's

00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,120
the ability to engage in this type of

00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:16,190
behavior or the very least pretend it

00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,820
doesn't exist because it doesn't affect

00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:22,610
you so what does this mean for our

00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:25,760
community it means that we have capable

00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:28,639
passionate hard-working people who want

00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,729
to contribute to our community who could

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,710
add incredible value to all of us and

00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:35,419
they can't and they're being denied that

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:45,080
opportunity for reasons that have

00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:46,849
nothing to do with it but the good news

00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,289
is that we're getting better I think

00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:50,080
we're getting better at addressing these

00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:51,889
issues that was very clear just from the

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,139
housekeeping items that were talked

00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:55,700
about earlier and over the years as a

00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:57,440
community we've gotten better at talking

00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,639
about it at tackling these issues and

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,320
we've had some really important people

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,820
do the heavy lifting I'm gonna highlight

00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,160
a couple of them right now

00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,870
one is Coraline a 2mp a show of hands if

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,150
you know for this person is she's

00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:09,620
awesome she's a self-proclaimed social

00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,900
justice warrior which i think it's my

00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,250
new favorite term and she created the

00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,349
contributor covenant which is the code

00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,550
of conduct for open source projects it's

00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:18,680
been very successful it's been adopted

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:22,160
by Jekyll and rubygems and a lot of

00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,919
really big important projects another

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,389
one I love is by Tracy Chow a couple

00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:27,740
years ago she went to the Grace Hopper

00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:30,289
conference show of hands you know Grace

00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:32,389
Hopper the conference focused on women

00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:34,039
in tech and when she was there she found

00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:36,139
that so many people were talking about

00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:37,190
the gender diversity issue and how hard

00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:39,410
it was and how there's just not enough

00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:41,960
women but there were no numbers there

00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:43,490
one of staff to back that up and so she

00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,280
kept asking well where is the data where

00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:48,229
the numbers and she finally opened up a

00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,370
it was just a Google spreadsheet and

00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:51,780
asked companies to

00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,300
and self-report their own diversity

00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:57,000
numbers and when she did that she was a

00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,260
huge huge influencer and getting big

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,720
organizations like Google and Facebook

00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:03,840
to talk openly about these issues and

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,250
now we have data we have a baseline so

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,190
we can see if we're actually doing

00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,660
better if we're singing another example

00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,500
I really like is Isis and I like this

00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,449
one because she was kind of an

00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,540
accidental one generally set out to be a

00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:18,300
diversity advocate but she was part of a

00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:21,210
hiring marketing campaign by her company

00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:23,370
one login and she had this Ashe is one

00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,660
of four engineers and someone took a

00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,550
picture of one of those ads made a

00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,949
comment and said something about how she

00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:32,010
didn't quite look like an engineer and

00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:34,440
so she started a hashtag movement which

00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,060
is the thing and it's called I look like

00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,930
an engineer and she invited women all

00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,339
over the world from different

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:40,500
backgrounds of tweets pictures of

00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:42,240
themselves and what they look like

00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,690
because they all look like engineers

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,760
because they are so going back to

00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:49,380
David's concept of privilege it makes

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,020
sense that he would focus so much on

00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:55,620
race and gender because a lot of the

00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:58,910
conversation is based on that but here's

00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:02,940
the thing I don't like that definition

00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:08,339
because I'm a woman and I'm a person of

00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:10,080
color and I'm drowning in privilege one

00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,970
of the most popular questions we get in

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,160
the Kona B community is how do I get a

00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:16,980
job as a corner I know how to code I've

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,839
taken a couple courses I've done a boot

00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,610
camp I've done my work how do I get

00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,730
employed and I guess one answer is to

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:25,830
talk to some of our sponsors here and

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:28,920
one of the common answers that we get is

00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:30,150
contribute to open source it's free you

00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,760
can do it from anywhere

00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:35,070
you just put stuff online you build it

00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,390
you do tweet it out you push it and your

00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,220
stuff is out there it's real you can

00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,779
build a really great portfolio that's

00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,860
one of those common advices that we get

00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:44,610
show fans that you've heard this advice

00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:46,830
before and your employment role yeah but

00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:50,520
what does it really take to contribute

00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:52,110
to open source it takes code right you

00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,370
have to know how to code and you can't

00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,529
just know a little bit you have to know

00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,390
enough to understand the project you're

00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:59,209
working in and dissect it and be able to

00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,750
give back to it in the meaningful way

00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:01,590
next you have to learn how to

00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,510
communicate

00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:05,430
it's really helpful if you can

00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:07,380
communicate in English because a lot of

00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,650
programming languages are usually done

00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:12,630
in English you have to have the time and

00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,710
time really means you have to have the

00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,720
money because you have to have the

00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:18,150
financial stability to justify spending

00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,390
so many hours giving up so much of your

00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:22,560
time to unpaid work it also means you

00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:25,140
have to have a computer which i think is

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,130
a pretty obvious one and you have to

00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,990
have internet access

00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,970
ideally high-speed Internet access you

00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:32,940
can make contributing to open source a

00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:35,070
regular part of your routine so if we

00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,980
think about open source contribution as

00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:40,680
a class these are almost like the

00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,540
prerequisites this is the stuff you have

00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,279
to do before you can even get to the

00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,570
door right let's forget about what

00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,980
happens once you're in the room to get

00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:50,400
through the door you kind of have to

00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,839
have these things to start so how do we

00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:56,089
get here how do we get to a place where

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,839
we have these prerequisites how do I get

00:10:56,089 --> 00:11:02,120
talked about this

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:04,470
I come from an upper middle-class house

00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,700
my parents are both pharmacists

00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:11,400
which is awesome because I get to say

00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:13,620
they sell drugs I'm Ethiopian was born

00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,960
in Ethiopia my dad came here when I was

00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,190
about 1 and then my mother and I

00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,380
followed when I was almost three years

00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:21,510
old and we lived the American dream by

00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:24,360
the book we start off with a really

00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:26,250
pathetic one-bedroom apartment in a not

00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,750
so great part of DC and then when I was

00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,910
nine we moved to one of the richest

00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,410
counties of the United States and then

00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,390
sometime in highschool we moved to the

00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:37,080
richest part of the richest County of

00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:40,650
the United States I didn't earn that my

00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:42,330
parents did but I didn't so what happens

00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:44,160
when you have parents who have good jobs

00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:47,100
and who can provide that type of

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,320
socio-economic stability there's a study

00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,940
that came out in 2014 by the National

00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,100
Bureau of Economic Research that asked

00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,870
where is the land of opportunity the

00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,110
geography of intergenerational mobility

00:11:54,870 --> 00:12:00,930
in the United States and it looked at

00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:03,000
how parents income affects children

00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:05,850
later on in life so if we look at this

00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,440
graph which I'm hoping you can see we

00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,089
can see the parent household income at

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,750
the bottom and then the mean child

00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:12,850
household income

00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,470
and we can see the correlation but the

00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,240
more money your parents make the more

00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:19,000
likely you are to be financially

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,010
successful later on as a result but how

00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,620
does this affect college well I got a

00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:26,290
graph of that too at the bottom we have

00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:29,230
parent income rank and on the Left we

00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:31,750
have % attending college at age 18 to 21

00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:33,610
and on the right we have college quality

00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,800
so we can see a similar correlation

00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,690
where the higher your parents income

00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,250
rank is the more likely you are to

00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,770
attend college and the better your

00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:44,620
apologist likely to be so we can see

00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:46,540
some very direct financial benefits of

00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:49,630
coming from that socio economic

00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:52,570
stability growing up but there are a few

00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,710
other positive side effects too one is

00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,450
that you're more likely to go to a

00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:57,280
really good public high school or public

00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,300
school period I went to a really great

00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,250
middle school really great high school

00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,410
they had a magnet program I applied I

00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:05,290
thought accepted I had a really really

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:07,840
great education going up when you're

00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:09,760
part of this system and you go to a

00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,650
great school in a great County it also

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,690
means that you are probably part of a

00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:16,240
community that has very high academic

00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:18,490
standards I didn't know college was an

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,770
option that was just the step after high

00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,270
school the question was how good of a

00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:25,930
college did you get into not if you were

00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:28,480
gonna go talk a little bit more about

00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:33,430
college I have two degrees and English

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:35,970
and psychology go liberal arts are you

00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,970
getting your money's worth

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:44,889
oh it's funny cause it's true okay so

00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:52,430
let's talk about how having these

00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:54,649
degrees affect your income so this looks

00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:56,870
at salary based on your degree and we

00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:58,339
can see that the higher the degree is

00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,050
the more money you make

00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:03,250
unless you have a PhD I don't know

00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:05,899
what's going on with the doctoral degree

00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,889
there they're not doing quite as well

00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:08,899
they're not following the trend but

00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:11,029
besides that the more money you make and

00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:13,130
we see the inverse correlation with

00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:14,720
unemployment rate right the higher your

00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:17,420
degree the less likely you are to be

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,060
unemployed let's get back to that

00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,769
awesome liberal arts degree one of the

00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,540
things that comes with that is very

00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:24,920
strong communication skills even if you

00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:27,290
don't have a liberal arts degree if you

00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,060
have a four-year degree most likely you

00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:30,920
had some type of a general sentence

00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:33,170
right where you had lots of group

00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,209
projects and reading and reports and

00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:37,130
writing and teamwork and all these

00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:38,959
things that over a number of years

00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,550
strengthen these communication skills

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,130
which we talked about are very important

00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:46,639
as part of our open source contribution

00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:49,100
prerequisites let's talk about computer

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,990
and internet access I had my first

00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,089
computer with internet at the age of

00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,920
nine I don't know what to do with it so

00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:55,510
I just played Oregon Trail over and over

00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:00,490
and over again

00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:00,490
yeah Oregon Trail I still hate wagons

00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:06,860
and at that age my mother forced me to

00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:08,750
learn how to touch tight I don't know

00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,370
how she knew how important that would be

00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,290
growing up but she's forced me to learn

00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,970
and touch the touch type and maybe speak

00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:16,730
and I were really good friends that is

00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:18,500
my home girl and in middle school in

00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:21,889
high school we didn't have a computer

00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:24,380
lab we had computer labs where we had

00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:26,420
max of all colors and we had the full

00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:30,079
Adobe suite I learned Final Cut Pro when

00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:35,930
I was 13 show of hands if you know what

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:37,339
an Internet desert is in our desert is

00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,560
when you don't have access to wired

00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:42,019
broadband more specifically it means

00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:44,899
that you don't have internet speeds or

00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:46,850
fast enough for you to do very basic web

00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:48,079
things things we've already we probably

00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,220
take for granted as we build our

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:53,520
products that include video

00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:55,350
or downloading images there are 11

00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,820
million people in the United States who

00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:01,950
don't have access to wired broadband

00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:04,590
going to a 2016 broadband progress

00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:06,030
report by the Epson see on average the

00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:08,880
proportion of the population without

00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:10,200
that internet access is highest in

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,150
counties with the lowest median

00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,610
household income the lowest population

00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:19,200
density the highest rural population

00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:21,170
range and the highest poverty rate if we

00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:25,680
look at this on an international level

00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:27,960
we can see that over half of the people

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,230
in the world don't have access to

00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:33,600
Internet and if you remember the panic

00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:37,200
that hit developers when github went

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,030
down the last time you can imagine how

00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:43,710
hard it is to be part of the tech

00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:46,800
community if you can't get online talk

00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:48,750
about health I've never thought much

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,340
about health I have all my limbs I have

00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,170
all my senses the worst thing that's

00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:55,220
happened to me help lies as having a UTI

00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:57,930
I'm just probably too much information

00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,940
which by the way if you don't know what

00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,900
that looks like is terrifying we were

00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:05,310
two emergency room I thought I was gonna

00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:08,699
die but not everyone has that good

00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:11,400
health 1 million people in the United

00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:15,329
States are functionally deaf 360 million

00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:18,630
in the world 1.3 million in the US are

00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:20,459
legally blind 39 million in the world we

00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:22,439
talk about color blindness one in twelve

00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:25,560
men one in two hundred women that's a

00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:29,250
lot of people and there are a couple

00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,930
issues around health that we also think

00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,730
about the obvious one is accessibility

00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:35,040
which means experiencing the world

00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:37,680
you're not having to find handicap

00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,420
accessible ways to go different floors

00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,340
and things like that but also technology

00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,900
by making sure that we can see things

00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,640
that our colors are just right and we

00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,200
take advantage of screen readers and

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,120
that kind of thing but there's also

00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,980
other things that I didn't really think

00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,630
too much about like the financial impact

00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,400
of having health issues does the fact

00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:56,970
that it's expensive health bills are

00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,530
real and they can get very very high but

00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,929
there's also the financial impact of not

00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,970
being able to work right of not being

00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:03,930
able to take care of yourself and take

00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,270
care of your

00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:09,030
because you're jus busy in the hospital

00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:11,460
and then there's the emotional stress of

00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:13,920
it all the frustration of wanting to do

00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:17,840
things and be a certain person and your

00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:21,510
body simply not letting me do that I

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:24,840
didn't earn being able body I don't have

00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:26,700
to worry about these things talk about

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,610
money I love talking about money right

00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:32,310
it's not family my parents paid for my

00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:37,500
education so I graduated debt-free sound

00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:39,180
like a real jerk but everyone has

00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,100
student debt right everyone has it it's

00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:44,610
it's normal let's take a look at exactly

00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:48,000
how much debt people have one point two

00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:50,160
trillion dollars forty million people in

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,900
the US have one point two trillion

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,940
dollars in student debt that comes out

00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,430
to about thirty thousand per person

00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,980
that's a lot of human death we compare

00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:00,570
it to other types of rome's we see that

00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,370
with the exception of a mortgage we owe

00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,990
more money in student loans than

00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:07,020
anything else and that's the reason that

00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:09,000
happened as of 2010 how does this impact

00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:13,830
your life after college how does this

00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,690
impact your choices 52% of people

00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:18,600
surveyed strongly agreed or somewhat

00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:20,580
agree to the statement my need to pay

00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,170
student loan debt is hampering my

00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:25,320
ability to further my career

00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:26,940
and I've seen this happen firsthand most

00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,800
people that I grew up with people I went

00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,900
to college with they have to take that

00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,420
first job out of college because they

00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,710
have loans to pay they can't afford to

00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,060
take unpaid internships they can't

00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,770
afford to find themselves they can't

00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,990
afford to travel for a couple months and

00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:41,430
a lot of times that first job is it an

00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,360
industry they have no interest in and

00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,590
they're building a career in our

00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:47,670
direction they have no desire to go to

00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:50,040
and the biggest thing this meant for me

00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:53,850
personally was that I didn't have to get

00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:55,680
a job I could build a career I could

00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:57,600
take the two-week gig that eventually

00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,670
turned into a contract I could take a

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,380
few months off I could do that paid

00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:03,540
internship that was only seven dollars

00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:07,640
an hour I can make decisions for my

00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:07,640
career is that up for my survival

00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:13,750
my parents relieved me of that burden in

00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:16,870
college which meant that years later I

00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:21,310
can learn to pose I could take my career

00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:23,020
in a whole different direction so how

00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:25,600
did I get here how do I get to a place

00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:27,340
where I can code I can communicate

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,950
I have internet I have computers I have

00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:32,860
a certain comfort with technology I have

00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:35,140
the financial stability to spend time on

00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:41,110
unpaid boards like interesting open

00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:43,510
source I'm really really fun and I bet

00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:45,490
that most of you are looking to and

00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:47,080
people hate hearing them by the way

00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:48,790
people want to believe that they're here

00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,530
because they worked really really hard

00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,730
and I was one of those people my husband

00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:53,530
used to tell me you know you're

00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,460
successful partly cuz you're lucky

00:20:53,530 --> 00:21:00,190
nothing at all

00:20:54,460 --> 00:21:04,990
I worked hard I earned my opening

00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:06,160
keynote engagement but as he said this

00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,590
over the years been together seven years

00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:11,680
and I kept mulling this over in my head

00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:13,630
and I'm old and I did tons of research

00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,760
and reading and really explore this

00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:21,520
topic and but tons of articles also

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:24,460
known as tweets and and I kept coming up

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:27,100
with this tension between luck and hard

00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:28,690
work because successful people famous

00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,090
people are telling me over and over

00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,350
again that they got there because they

00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,970
worked hard you just have to work out I

00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,410
think in Kevin Hart's bio it actually

00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,550
said I'm here because I worked hard

00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:38,770
people want to be here but they don't

00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:43,570
want to work for it it's a very common

00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:45,550
theme I recently left my position at

00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:47,590
Microsoft where I was a program manager

00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:49,420
to do coding would be full time and at

00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:51,760
Microsoft I managed a technical training

00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:53,560
program called tech jobs Academy and we

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,540
served unemployed and underemployed New

00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,730
Yorkers who were passionate who were

00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,470
bright for smart and who just needed an

00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:02,950
opportunity to launch their tenth career

00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:06,730
and guess what those people were really

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:10,000
really hard - I have a graduate who's

00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:12,370
raising four kids on her own she's been

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,920
finding an hour here and there over a

00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:16,390
number of years to get technical taking

00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,840
a course when she can go into the

00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:22,920
library when she can slowly

00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:25,470
trying to get closer to her career by

00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,460
the time that I waltz into my cushy temp

00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:29,460
job at 10:00 a.m.

00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:33,420
she's already fed four people she works

00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:37,260
really hard to so it can't be just about

00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:39,000
hard work I'm lucky that I didn't have

00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,260
to worry about money I didn't have to

00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,030
worry about health I don't have to think

00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:44,490
about where my next meal was coming from

00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:47,250
I had the exposure the stability the

00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:51,210
support system early on in life so that

00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:54,380
as an adult I was unburdened and I could

00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:56,010
take my load free shoulders and lean in

00:22:54,380 --> 00:23:00,480
to my work

00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:04,260
I was lucky first so that I could work

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,030
hard later and that's okay having a bit

00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,590
of luck takes nothing away from your

00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:09,090
hard work if you're lucky and you don't

00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:12,030
work hard that's just a huge waste of

00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:13,920
opportunity but it's a lot easier to

00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:16,200
meet those prerequisites when you're a

00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,910
little bit lucky to start it's a lot

00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,800
easier to be in that place where you can

00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:20,910
contribute to open source where you can

00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,740
be here and you can be part of this

00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:27,450
community if you're a little bit less a

00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:29,640
little luck goes a long way so what

00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:32,250
happens when technology is dictated by

00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,440
the lucky what happens when those of us

00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,920
for statistically better position to

00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,250
succeed

00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,930
are also the ones in power what happens

00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,240
when we dictate how everyone else

00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:44,040
interacts with technology how they

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:50,700
connect with families how they access

00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:54,000
their memories show of hands if you are

00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:56,900
southern Valley oh I love it cuz it's so

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,370
true you end up in my fresh filter

00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:01,590
that's what happens I love this scene

00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:03,240
because it captures everything I love

00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:05,820
and everything i lo with about the tech

00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,380
community in this scene the main

00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,830
character is interviewing for a CTO

00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:12,360
position and the company says oh you're

00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,640
gonna work on just world-changing

00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:16,650
technology it's gonna be great oh yeah

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,910
it's a public let's do this they set him

00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:20,310
up with front of a monitor to give him

00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:20,670
controllers and they put a fake mustache

00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,350
on him

00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:23,700
and he looks around he goes I thought

00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,860
this was world-changing technology I

00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,360
don't understand and they go oh no it's

00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,429
fine don't worry there's different types

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,379
of mustaches

00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:32,950
and here's the thing mustaches are super

00:24:32,379 --> 00:24:34,629
fun

00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:36,749
this is awesome I feel like I look

00:24:34,629 --> 00:24:40,840
really good in a mustache I really do

00:24:36,749 --> 00:24:43,210
but to me this captures a very important

00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:47,379
thing which is how we think about

00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:49,779
problems we tend to sell solve problems

00:24:47,379 --> 00:24:51,190
that we personally experience because we

00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,360
understand them we empathize with them

00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,429
we probably have a roomful of people

00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,249
that we can spend all day ranting to

00:24:54,429 --> 00:24:59,379
about those problems but if we only

00:24:57,249 --> 00:25:01,419
solve the problems that we experience

00:24:59,379 --> 00:25:05,259
that we're comfortable with then we

00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:08,259
leave everyone else behind so what do we

00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:09,789
do with our life and I thought about

00:25:08,259 --> 00:25:11,649
this for a long time so I want to leave

00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:12,730
you with the type of an action item I

00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:14,470
don't want to burden you with all this

00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:16,779
there's guilt of being lucky I want to

00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:18,549
give you something to do and there are

00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:21,220
many different solutions but I think it

00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:25,960
all boils down to one very very simple

00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:27,759
thing to expand your problem for the

00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,009
more problems that we can understand the

00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:32,710
more problems were exposed to the more

00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:34,119
able we are to share our luck and there

00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:36,820
are few specific ways that we can do

00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:39,309
this one is very simple it's to follow

00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:42,129
people who are not like you that might

00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:44,080
mean based on gender or race it might

00:25:42,129 --> 00:25:45,730
mean just location I love following

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,950
people who are outside of the United

00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:49,389
States just because it's interesting to

00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:50,739
see what other international issues

00:25:49,389 --> 00:25:53,200
they're dealing with in the tech

00:25:50,739 --> 00:25:54,429
community lots of times when I tweet and

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,820
I say goodnight they're saying good

00:25:54,429 --> 00:26:01,210
morning it's fun international it's also

00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:03,129
great to interview to follow people who

00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:05,109
have different opinions half the people

00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:08,799
I follow I don't even like that I follow

00:26:05,109 --> 00:26:10,179
them but I follow them because I want to

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,100
understand their perspective I want to

00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:13,690
hear their opinion you don't have to

00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,519
engage you don't have to comment you

00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:17,980
don't have to agree but exposing

00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:19,980
yourself just by listening and get you

00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,749
very far

00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:24,399
volunteering it's a little bit more

00:26:21,749 --> 00:26:26,409
involved both fine organizations like

00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:27,609
Django Girls where you can spend a

00:26:26,409 --> 00:26:29,169
little bit of time and get to know

00:26:27,609 --> 00:26:31,450
people who might have problems that are

00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:32,559
different and this one's really powerful

00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:34,059
because you get to build real

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,259
relationships you're not just reading an

00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,999
article you're not reading a tweet

00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:38,320
they're actually sitting down with

00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:40,389
another person getting to know their

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,000
personality into who they are getting to

00:26:40,389 --> 00:26:44,820
hear their origin story

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,760
a third one is my ferret one is

00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:49,230
amplifying voices like I mentioned the

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,970
three incredible women who are doing a

00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:52,800
lot of the heavy lifting to make our

00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:55,020
tech community a better place there are

00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,700
lots of other people like them you can

00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,110
make their job just a little bit easier

00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,120
with something as simple as a retweet

00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:01,250
something as simple as recommending them

00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,000
to speak at the next conference

00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,630
recommending them for a position at your

00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,370
job

00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:07,860
there are very simple ways to amplify

00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:10,620
voices of people who are doing a lot of

00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:13,800
the hard work and very little costume

00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:16,280
and my hope is that as you do these

00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,990
things you can incorporate the

00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,970
experiences and the issues and the

00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:23,880
perspectives that you hear into your own

00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:26,190
code and we can do this when we think

00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,920
about things like accessibility are we

00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:30,570
making sure we use those alt text are we

00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,760
making sure that we've checked our

00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:34,170
website and used screen readers are we

00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,330
doing these things to make sure that the

00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:39,000
products that we build are accessible to

00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:40,500
as many people as possible we think

00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,060
about internet speeds how big are your

00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,970
file sizes the photo doesn't need to be

00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:46,530
that big that's wrong make sure to think

00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:49,110
about these issues when you're building

00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:51,240
your next product another one that I

00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:54,000
really like is taking advantage of

00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:57,060
convention creativity is awesome and

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,770
it's great but a lot of times you don't

00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:01,650
need it use the rules that everyone

00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:04,230
already knows use icons and symbols and

00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:07,590
expected user flows to build products

00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:09,210
that don't require knowing English easy

00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,590
ways that we can build products for

00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:12,060
everyone and there are some awesome

00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:14,010
examples of people who are doing this

00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,660
one is Code for America show of hands if

00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:17,400
you know Club for America that's an

00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,170
awesome awesome organization been around

00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,120
for six years and they've worked with

00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:23,400
over a hundred government agencies local

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,410
agencies to really understand the

00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,650
problems in their community and build

00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:31,110
tech products to solve them another

00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:34,800
really great inspiration is the 18f blog

00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:36,900
show of hands if you know 1800 so hnf is

00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,820
an office inside the General Services

00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:41,160
Administration and they help other

00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:43,140
federal agencies build by and share tech

00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,120
solutions and what I love about their

00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,740
blog is they're very transparent they're

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,470
very open they share as much of their

00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:51,179
data as they can and they talk very

00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,679
openly about problems that the

00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:54,620
government is facing and different

00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:56,760
issues and ways that they solve it

00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:59,430
another one that specific to New York

00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:03,000
City is the big apps competition and I

00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:05,550
love this competition every year the EDC

00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,350
works with another company actually

00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:10,470
making it remember and they put on a

00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:11,760
competition to solve four big problems

00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:14,130
and this year the four problems were

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,230
affordable housing waste civic

00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:18,000
engagement and connecting cities and the

00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:20,280
best part about what competition is it's

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,290
very public so throughout the year you

00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:25,320
have hackathons an event where people

00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:27,060
are invited to come and listen and see

00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,620
these problems and see different ways

00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:31,740
that we can solve it it's incredibly

00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:34,760
inspirational so I encourage you to

00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:37,770
expand your problem and share your luck

00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:40,980
because the more we can do this the more

00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:43,620
we can help people now when we talk

00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:45,860
about luck and privilege it might sound

00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:51,900
like we're talking about the person

00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:55,140
you're not not diversity I hate the word

00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:59,640
diversity diversity talks about

00:29:55,140 --> 00:30:02,100
differences it draws lines between us it

00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:05,010
assumes that there is unnormal and there

00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:07,050
is another and if we just get enough

00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:09,930
others in the room and we're diverse

00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:16,260
we're doing great diversity is too easy

00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:18,480
to have us I prefer the term because

00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:22,440
inclusion requires you to always ask

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:25,310
yourself Who am i leaving out whose

00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:29,390
voice whose story is not being heard

00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:33,960
whose perspective are we not considering

00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:37,110
inclusion is worthy and elusive it

00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:40,230
demands that we care it requires that we

00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:43,230
emphasize it will outlast the latest

00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:44,800
diversity trend it cannot be captured in

00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:47,150
a hashtag

00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:50,780
it's easy to talk about women in tech

00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:52,790
and the truly pathetic number of people

00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:54,410
of color in the tech industry but I

00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:56,950
worried that when we focused on just

00:30:54,410 --> 00:31:00,470
race and gender we forget everyone else

00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:02,150
we forget about the single moms and the

00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:05,270
dads working three shifts just to make

00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:07,580
ends meet we forget about the long line

00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:09,290
of people waiting every morning at the

00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:15,080
library just so they can use the

00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:17,710
computer that day inclusion demands that

00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,940
we'll invite everyone to the table

00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:22,550
because when technology is dictated by

00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:26,470
everyone we're all a little better off

00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:26,470
and we can all be a little more

00:31:53,509 --> 00:32:00,929
fantastic work thank very much

00:31:55,169 --> 00:32:02,279
and my question is about the for those

00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:04,769
of us who are lucky for those of us who

00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:06,029
have had this sort of experience has

00:32:04,769 --> 00:32:09,899
been been very good I'd count myself

00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:11,220
amongst them we're exposed as we see

00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:12,509
what's going on we can listen to the

00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,429
other opinions that are out there we can

00:32:12,509 --> 00:32:16,860
listen to other people and you try to

00:32:14,429 --> 00:32:18,179
get involved you try to help and then

00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:20,759
you help so much that you end up being

00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:21,600
exhausted and you end up not being

00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:25,590
useful to anyone

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,090
so do you have any tips for self-care in

00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:28,860
all of this of you know and it sounds

00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:30,299
really bad if it's all about you but not

00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:32,970
bad what about me you know I'm more

00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:36,929
importantly without going that far but

00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:38,879
it's how do you balance the the need to

00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:41,700
self-care and not be sort of smothered

00:32:38,879 --> 00:32:42,749
by the empathy for everybody else and oh

00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,999
god I feel so guilty

00:32:42,749 --> 00:32:46,710
versus the fact that yet they actually

00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:48,840
need as much help and lifting up as you

00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:53,690
can give them oh that's such a good

00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:53,690
question oh I'm so proud of you

00:32:54,650 --> 00:33:02,160
have a good way healthcare yeah so show

00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:04,260
of hands if you read medium at all okay

00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:06,030
so I recently started blogging have been

00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:08,850
very good I've done like five blog posts

00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:11,880
in the week credible very exhausting but

00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:13,020
now that you know a bunch of very not

00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,000
great things that happened the last

00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:16,620
couple weeks I can't look at medium

00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,840
anymore because it's it's it's just

00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:20,970
draining I just see nothing but bad

00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,400
experiences and and sad anecdotes and

00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:26,070
it's the most disempowering thing that I

00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,510
can read and so I think that there are

00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:29,640
definitely times where I just have to

00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:31,620
step away where I have to not look at

00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:36,120
medium I have to not look at Twitter and

00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:39,179
I try to I try to find the positive

00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:41,250
stories and I'll just reread them to

00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:42,809
make to give myself a little bit more

00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:44,400
hope if that makes sense

00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:46,290
so I'll read about the success stories

00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,670
I'll read you know books that I really

00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:49,020
like from you know people who are

00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:50,850
underrepresented who are doing really

00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,200
great things at all I'll gravitate and

00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:53,850
I'll go back to these really important

00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,809
stories that are very very positive and

00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:56,760
just take a break and I think it's

00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:58,170
totally fine by the way I think there's

00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,190
a difference between being informed and

00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:01,020
being informed to the point of

00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:02,700
exhaustion and finding that balance is

00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:04,800
very personal but definitely feel free

00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,630
to take a step back and focus on the

00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,429
process

00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:10,470
what squidclaw do you know if any like

00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:12,810
good pipelines of sources of good

00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:23,190
stories like essentially like Twitter

00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:25,919
but only the good stuff thanks for named

00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:27,419
heaven heaven the got to and she

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:28,470
actually had a hashtag I wish I

00:34:27,419 --> 00:34:30,720
remembered it I'm gonna find it I'll

00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:33,540
tweet it later but it's a hashtag that's

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,429
something like black kids having fun or

00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:37,980
just something like and the idea was

00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:39,000
just being very very exhausted by you

00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,010
know all those shootings and things that

00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,409
have happened and just wanting a stream

00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:45,000
of just nothing but positive joy and a

00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:47,100
bunch of people from all over the world

00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,379
tweeted and sent pictures and videos of

00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:51,720
their you know of their kids just

00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:53,250
playing having fun and it was amazing it

00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,480
was a huge source of positivity so I'm

00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,919
gonna find that hashtag and I'm gonna

00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,210
tweet it at my account and you can take

00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:59,730
a look at it so nobody it's a good

00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:02,130
starting point for you gotta come up

00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,950
with like a bag of positive things after

00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:05,690
this

00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:09,020
what you got I have a question I'm also

00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:11,329
really short so I'm like oh my Toto is

00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:12,530
here so part of Django con is code

00:35:11,329 --> 00:35:14,300
sprints which will happen on Thursday

00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:15,950
and Friday where we kind of you know as

00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,060
many people together as we can and we we

00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:18,920
contribute to different Django

00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:21,320
open-source projects what are things

00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,700
that we should be doing or that we

00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,630
should be providing as a conference or

00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,359
that the sprint leader should be

00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:27,500
providing to and this is maybe a

00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:29,000
question for next year because everyone

00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,619
who's gonna sprint is already here but

00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,750
what what can we do to include people

00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:35,960
who are not as lucky oh that's a

00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:37,099
question so I think that I think

00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,710
accessibility is probably one of the

00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:42,020
easier things to incorporate into no

00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:43,190
code and and products and I think for me

00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,900
I was very

00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:46,220
I'm still a little intimidated by it

00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,720
because I just think it's gonna be very

00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:49,970
hard and I think it's gonna add all this

00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,380
next work and so I think a really great

00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:53,270
thing that conferences can do is maybe

00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:55,400
do a five-minute lightning talk on easy

00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:56,630
ways to include things like alt text and

00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,849
how to make your image is smaller and

00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:59,960
all these things that might seem very

00:35:57,849 --> 00:36:01,700
intimidating and very like oh man I have

00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,859
to add this whole thing on top of my

00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,780
feature so just providing that

00:36:03,859 --> 00:36:07,460
information so it's so that we know it's

00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:09,109
not actually as hard as it might seem

00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,069
and highlighting the benefits of it I

00:36:09,109 --> 00:36:13,599
think that'd be a really great way to

00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:13,599
kick off any hackathon or anything

00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,590
while we're waiting for our next

00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,460
question to make but we have someone

00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:29,140
with question making the way to the

00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:30,970
microphone so while that person making

00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,440
their way to the mic aisle we get a rate

00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:34,060
yes if you want to give a line you talk

00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,510
on accessibility a lightning talk sign

00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:38,980
up for him is at the registration desk

00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:42,520
okay so this kind of this is a question

00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:45,340
that kind of goes beyond the technical

00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:51,099
industry okay but you know we can stick

00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:52,990
to that how do you get people to care I

00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:54,820
mean we talk about the number of people

00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:55,900
that you know aren't on the Internet

00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:58,900
they don't have a broadband internet

00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:02,530
access um they don't have the access

00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:04,300
they're gonna have the luck but when

00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:06,369
they you know when you're interacting

00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:09,550
with them and they say well why should I

00:37:06,369 --> 00:37:11,830
care about that you know I mean and you

00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:12,910
know they should yeah because I mean you

00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:16,000
know honestly we're talking about

00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:19,210
feeling lucky and well aren't we lucky

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,830
that somebody figured out zero thousands

00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:24,010
of years ago because we really do you

00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:25,540
love zero yeah hmm but some anyway so

00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:28,440
what are your thoughts on that I mean

00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:36,910
how do we how do you engage people who

00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:38,470
are so disenfranchised by their

00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:40,119
circumstance I mean like that they don't

00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:42,849
even understand what they don't have

00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:44,470
access to oh that's oh you're talking

00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:46,510
about the people who are not lucky who

00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:48,369
don't know they're not lucky well or

00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:49,270
they don't like when when you're

00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:51,880
interacting with them and you're

00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:53,619
suggesting it's like well you know have

00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:57,790
you have you thought about you know have

00:37:53,619 --> 00:38:00,640
you thought about exploring you know you

00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:03,550
know programming mmm coding you know

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,859
like as a thing you know as a or or even

00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:10,930
just you know technology as a way to

00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:13,270
communicate as a way to find a place in

00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:18,210
the community that's more than just like

00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:21,839
the block that you live on mm-hmm so

00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:21,839
he's right there by the way

00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:28,060
but that's a really good question

00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:31,360
because we deal with that a lot where we

00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:32,620
will share really important potentially

00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,930
life-changing information whether it's

00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:37,330
how to code or how to save money or

00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:40,120
things like that to people and they're

00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:41,440
not very receptive to it and I mean

00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,450
there's two things I learned from that I

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,610
think one is that there's kind of a

00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,990
limit of how much you can make people do

00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:48,370
what you want I wish I can make people

00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:50,710
do what I want them to all the time it

00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:54,130
does not work I've done pretty well with

00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:56,350
him but that's basically it but I think

00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:59,020
that it's important to provide

00:38:56,350 --> 00:39:01,540
information and to provide consistent

00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,800
support and so I've had people who the

00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,120
first time I mentioned hey you should

00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,250
learn the code there is code Academy

00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:08,470
there is treehouses fortunes really you

00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:09,730
know easy ways to start and know but I

00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:11,740
don't know about that and then I'll just

00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:13,270
kind of remind them I'll bring them up

00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:14,980
and over a peer to and let them know

00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:16,990
that if they do change their mind they

00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:19,030
aren't interested I'm there to make the

00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:20,800
journey easier for them so I don't think

00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:22,600
it's as simple as going to one hackathon

00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,190
having one conversation ban their life

00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,410
is no different

00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:28,060
I think it's introducing and being

00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:29,890
consistently supportive so they know

00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,990
that if they do come around if they do

00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:33,310
change their mind if they you know a lot

00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:34,360
of times they're just really intimated

00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,680
they don't believe that they can

00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:38,920
actually do it and if you just

00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,910
consistently show them that they can go

00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,740
through your own work if you're

00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:43,450
encouraging words I find that over time

00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,890
they'll at least try it

00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:46,660
they'll try it to a point that maybe

00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:52,360
they actually do take that information

00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:53,920
do something positive yeah maybe our

00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:56,530
last question we're running out of time

00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:00,460
so and now we have a conversation going

00:39:56,530 --> 00:40:02,680
when you do that with you know for

00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:05,770
social justice you know you have like a

00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:07,540
neighbor you let them come over and play

00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:09,580
Minecraft with your kids then you show

00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:11,430
them the raspberry pi server or you know

00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:14,770
you got them into it that can work right

00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:17,620
well so what if you're trying to

00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:19,630
transform an organization and they

00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:23,760
already sort of think they know how to

00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:27,940
code but you really do know a lot more

00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,710
and you know you know obviously you

00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:32,050
don't want to you know talk about bloom

00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:34,540
filters or this algorithm or that

00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:36,430
algorithm you want to talk about you

00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:37,400
should try Jango you know here's what I

00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:39,980
can do I can

00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,900
can set up this this thing really simple

00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:46,130
and look five lines of code I've got a

00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:49,370
crud application and no repeat code but

00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:52,310
how do you keep on doing that and bring

00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:53,960
them up you know over time that's

00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:56,450
something that I have to learn how to do

00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:58,760
I certainly don't know it isn't your

00:40:56,450 --> 00:41:01,100
internal organization are you yes okay I

00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:03,200
have no experience with that to be very

00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:05,870
honest I'm gonna stick with in my own

00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,300
wheelhouse my guess is that it's a

00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:09,710
similar process of so we've had a lot of

00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:13,040
people on the couldn't be podcast talk

00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:14,660
about how they got their start coding by

00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,610
taking an idea that someone in the

00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,900
office had building an app on the side

00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:19,250
on the weekends coming back and saying

00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,690
look what I did and then they'll look at

00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,950
that and go oh that's very interesting

00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:23,720
we didn't know we could do that
