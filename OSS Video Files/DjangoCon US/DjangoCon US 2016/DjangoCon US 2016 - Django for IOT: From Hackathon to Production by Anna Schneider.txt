	Django for IOT: From Hackathon to Production by Anna Schneider

Itâ€™s Friday night of hackathon weekend. The latest snazzy Internet-connected thingy is sitting on the table next to your beverage of choice, the deviceâ€™s API docs are open in a browser tab, and your fingers are itching to write some Django. Whatâ€™s the fastest way to get started? And next month when you come back to it, what will you want to upgrade?

This talk will walk through a common IoT use case, sending HTTP requests to turn on and off a device in response to some external data. I do this all the time at WattTime and I'll share some of the tricks I've picked up over the last couple years.

Weâ€™ll focus on two big differences from your typical blog or polls app: the data model abstractions that fit the problem, and the need to run frequent periodic tasks to hit the deviceâ€™s API. I'll share a data model that's worked well for me across a bunch of IoT apps. And I'll show you two ways to run those periodic background tasks in Django: a hackathon-friendly version, and a production-friendly version using Celery. You'll walk away with a complete demo template that you can use in your own projects!
