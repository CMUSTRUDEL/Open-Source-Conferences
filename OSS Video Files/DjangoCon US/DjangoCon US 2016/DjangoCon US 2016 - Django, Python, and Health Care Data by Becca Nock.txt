Description: 
	Django, Python, and Health Care Data by Becca Nock

Data and technology can be used to improve the health of older adults and to help them to continue to live at home and in the community as they age. Predictive analytics and modeling can predict who will get sick, be hospitalized, or have adverse outcomes in the future. Once we know who is at risk, we can design interventions to decrease the likelihood of negative health outcomes.

This talk will introduce you to health care data sources, such as electronic medical records and insurance claims; predictive modeling and how it can be used to improve the care we provide; and publicly available and open health data. We will talk about the D2S2 (discharge decision support system), which helps health care providers make decisions when older adults are getting ready to be discharged from the hospital; and how Django and Python can be used to visualize open health-related data.

Intro: Who I am (2 min)
Health care data and where it comes from (5 min)
Electronic health records
Dr. Chrono is actually built with Django!
Claims data
Predictive modeling and decision support (10 min)
Predicting readmissions & the discharge decision support system (D2S2)
Predict whether older adults are at high risk or low risk of being readmitted to the hospital after discharge.
Building decision support to improve hospital discharge decision-making
Once we know a patient is at high risk of being readmitted, how do we decide what care they should receive after they leave the hospital? Use expert knowledge to develop decision support into the electronic medical record that will recommend a site for post acute care (care once the patient leaves the hospital).
Building patient preferences into the recommendations made to health care providers about what care the patient should receive after their hospitalization.

	00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:29,670
so I think it's really I here with me

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:31,740
learning about healthcare data about me

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,719
I did my undergrad in nursing at the

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,390
University of Pittsburgh oh and I'm

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,700
still registered nurse and I came to

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,309
Penn in 2013 but the picture on the left

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,960
is my a nursing school graduation where

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:45,809
we graduated in white scrubs with

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,420
Florence Nightingale lamps always good

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:49,550
um so I came to Penn in 2013 I did a

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,750
masters in Healthcare Administration

00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,800
people are starting my PhD in nursing

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,440
informatics

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,930
I'm a full-time PhD student here I

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,969
started to learn we're about technology

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,550
and learning the code in 2014 through

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:05,250
girl develop it Philly for those of you

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,950
that aren't familiar TBI is a fabulous

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,920
organization they do low-cost technology

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,020
classes for women and into a really safe

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,090
learning environment and so I learned

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,119
sequel to them and Python and a ton of

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,369
other just textiles it's been really

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,040
amazing I also wanted to give a shout

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:24,509
out to tech girl that is an organization

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,780
based here in Philly that teaches middle

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,820
school girls technology and helps them

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,770
form a community and see all the

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,110
different careers that involved tap and

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,640
they have some Python hercule as well

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,860
it's open source right on that's

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,900
interested and then the bottom picture

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,960
on the right with the big check isin my

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,170
fun fact for the day that's Dorito fest

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,880
2015 I have won every hackathon that

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:52,729
I've participated in

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,429
yeah really proud about that I wanted to

00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:57,590
just shout out and think quite a few

00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:59,840
people that helped me get up here today

00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:02,209
and encouraged me to submit the CFP for

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,939
this presentation a lot of them are here

00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:06,560
at dango con and in the audience here in

00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:09,019
Philly we have an amazing women in tech

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,239
community and there was a conference in

00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:12,950
Wharton called Le Coq in November where

00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:14,900
I've met a lot of women that are sitting

00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,090
in here today and I've been extremely

00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,379
encouraging as well as everyone that

00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,750
encouraged me over Twitter that I

00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:23,180
haven't yet met in person and especially

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,970
I want to thank Lacey Williams Henschel

00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:29,060
for talking with me about my CFP idea

00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:32,510
and reviewing my drafts so if we get

00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,190
started so when I was a clinical nurse I

00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,170
worked with older adults I loved working

00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,760
with older adults and Technology

00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,879
especially it gets me really excited

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,530
when older adults use technology and

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,209
throughout this presentation when I see

00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,790
older adults in the u.s. that means

00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:49,849
anyone over the age of 65 though I don't

00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:52,489
think that's very old but that's kind of

00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:54,440
the target population and I especially

00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:56,299
love when tech help older adults stay

00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,500
healthy so throughout this presentation

00:02:56,299 --> 00:02:58,970
I'll be talking generally about

00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,549
healthcare data and some of the ways

00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:03,349
that I've applied it but a lot of my

00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:04,940
work is specifically related to older

00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:07,310
adults and how we can use data and

00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,569
technology to help them stay healthy and

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,930
living in the community in their own

00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:13,970
homes so just a quick outline I'm gonna

00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,799
do an intro to healthcare data talked

00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:18,380
about clinical decision support and the

00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:19,790
discharge decision support system some

00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,260
predictive analytics projects in

00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,690
healthcare a little bit about open

00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:27,650
health data and then some uses of Python

00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:29,630
and Django in healthcare so sources of

00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,400
healthcare data where does it all come

00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:33,139
from I know there's a lot of hype around

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,690
big data in general and especially in

00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:37,160
the healthcare industry and it's there's

00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,930
so much healthcare data being produced

00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,120
every time you go to the doctor they

00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,620
collect all kinds of data your vital

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,100
signs your chief complaint or what

00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,440
brought you

00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,570
that day your symptoms what your heart

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,310
and lungs sound like and more and your

00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,630
doctor might tend to you to go get blood

00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:53,900
work and then you're gonna have even

00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:55,670
more lousy and then all of them has to

00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,160
be paid by your insurance company who

00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:01,610
then produces claims about this data

00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,470
this pictures shows all the users and

00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:06,320
people that are producing data so the

00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:08,300
hospital physicians patients themselves

00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:12,230
can create personal health records now

00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:15,320
labs public health reporting payers and

00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:17,300
researchers some here in academia in my

00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,550
kuchi program I produced two research

00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,470
type data I've also worked in community

00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,490
health with public health data but a lot

00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,530
of the data that I'll be talking about

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,480
today is electronic medical records data

00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:29,000
as well as claims data and that's what

00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,680
I've used most recently and so old

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,210
tronic health record data is used to

00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,940
provide care and it's very focused on

00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,650
what the providers need to record and

00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,780
what they're interested in finding out

00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:41,720
versus insurance claims data is very

00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,730
much for billing purposes so there are

00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,440
some differences between the two with

00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:48,070
claims data there's a lot of

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,170
standardized coding and I used mainly

00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:54,110
icd-10 codes which you might occur to

00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:56,110
just transition from icd-9 to 10 fairly

00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,520
recently and those are diagnosis codes

00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,800
and also used a lot when I was working

00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,560
in insurance and you see codes different

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,440
medications CPT codes which are lab

00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,020
values versus electronic health record

00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,910
data there's free text form there's

00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:14,180
drop-down menus you can put a lot of

00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:16,070
more detail in there with claims data

00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,630
something that I did a lot when I was

00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:20,150
working in insurance is you can easily

00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,950
look at an individual person as well as

00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:24,410
population level data it's very easy to

00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:26,660
say all everyone in my population with

00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:29,330
diabetes versus electronic health

00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:32,360
records are very patient center you know

00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:35,120
very detailed reports about one patient

00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,580
you can look at the whole population as

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,560
well and abstract the data out of

00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:42,350
medical records but a little bit easier

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,910
on claims data in one really nice thing

00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,720
about claims data as you see everything

00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,210
that

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,800
patient did so if today we're in Philly

00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:51,080
a we have a lot of different hospital

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,780
systems here if a patient goes to Penn

00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,760
this week and Jefferson next week and

00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,280
con them in the week after all of them

00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,560
is going to come up in their claims data

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,920
versus the EHR data is from one health

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,170
system so if they're at Penn you won't

00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,720
see their health information from other

00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:10,460
health systems you might if you're lucky

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,020
get their primary care physician and

00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,620
their inpatient in the same system but

00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:17,300
not always and claims data is not in

00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,750
real time it takes the billing process

00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,490
in the coding process versus EHR data is

00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,650
typically available in real time in the

00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:27,290
hospital but something that I've

00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:30,530
experienced in June research with EHR

00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:32,180
data is that if you go to multiple

00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,250
hospitals even if they're using the same

00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,350
electronic medical record system which

00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,669
is not necessarily likely if they're

00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,680
using different versions of the same

00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:43,850
software it can be very hard to merge

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,260
all the data so the first main thing I'm

00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,470
gonna be talking about the main project

00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:50,330
is a type of clinical decision support

00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:53,750
and this is built into a lot of EHRs

00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:55,880
today each arm has all this data that

00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:59,270
they can see in there in the system and

00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:01,880
they can help providers through alerts

00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:04,160
and a couple of other mechanisms so they

00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,320
can help through alerts and reminders so

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,850
they know all the medications that a

00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,220
patient is on if you put in a new

00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:12,890
medication and it might interact it can

00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,510
alert to that or say there's just have

00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,729
blood work done every couple weeks for

00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:19,040
something automatic reminders can come

00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:20,870
up after that time has passed and they

00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,840
also have clinical guidelines and a lot

00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:27,410
of the EHRs so if you know the diagnosis

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,850
of a patient then you know that there's

00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,620
certain things that the physician or

00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:33,880
nurse should be doing and those can

00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:36,860
automatically pop up in the system with

00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,540
they are also order set so say you go to

00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,280
the hospital and you're having chest

00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,889
pain there's certain things that

00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,139
everyone would get and though

00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:46,460
we'll kind of the computer automatically

00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:49,189
tell you that you need to do those

00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,900
things as well as there's a diagnostic

00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:53,300
support in the form of clinical decision

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,979
support so if you know certain things

00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,930
you've gotten certain lab values certain

00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:59,780
test results the computer can help you

00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,460
narrow down between diagnosis and so

00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,740
clinical decision support just really

00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:06,590
supports the providers and patients and

00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,840
carers in some situations to make better

00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:12,680
decisions have all that data organized

00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,330
to make the right decision so the

00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,770
decision support that I work on this is

00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,229
a project terrible I am about the

00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:20,240
professor's name is dr. Kathy Bowles and

00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:22,849
she works on discharge decision support

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,039
so this is when a patient is in the

00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:26,900
hospital inpatient and they're going to

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,520
be discharged out of the hospital so

00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,520
they're leaving

00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,870
and just an FYI most of the research

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,269
throughout the rest of the presentation

00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,130
I have links to at the bottom dr. Boles

00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:38,329
has so many articles that kind of I

00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,829
pulled together for this presentation

00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:42,140
that if you're interested in the

00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:43,490
published research I'm copy the share um

00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,490
but I didn't include all the links of

00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:49,160
sublime and such so the patients are

00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:51,140
leaving the hospital it's a very complex

00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,029
time they have the situation that in

00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,800
where they were before if everything

00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:56,660
that happened in the hospital and it's

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,250
especially complex for older adults that

00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,890
a lot of times have multiple chronic

00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:03,380
diseases and just really complex

00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:05,480
treatment plans and so the decision of

00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,100
whether they need to go somewhere after

00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,040
they leave the hospital before returning

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:13,399
home or a long-term care facility can be

00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,709
a very complicated decision and so all

00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,600
of a lot of Kathy voles recent research

00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:21,019
is all around building decision support

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,640
around the discharge decisions and so

00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:24,470
currently in the research I'll be

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,959
talking about three main questions that

00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:28,790
we're using software to answer so who is

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,949
at risk of poor outcomes after leaving

00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:32,329
the hospital what care should the

00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:34,550
patient receive after hospitalization

00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:36,740
and why our patients refusing post

00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:38,720
hospital care and I'll be using the term

00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,790
post acute care kind of throughout the

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,150
presentation and acute care at the

00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,920
hospital setting post

00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:46,290
here's kind of anything right afterwards

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,120
this includes home care inpatient

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:51,240
rehabilitation skilled nursing

00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,700
facilities nursing home and hospice in

00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,990
this transition out of the hospital is

00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,790
really important we know people that

00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,830
leave the hospital with unmet needs end

00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:01,650
up right back in the hospital they go to

00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:03,600
the emergency department they lose

00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:06,000
function such as walking or being able

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:11,970
to bathe themselves and so it's just an

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:14,190
important transition so the first

00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:17,370
question who is at risk of poor outcomes

00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,870
so the goal is to determine patients at

00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,970
a high risk and low risk and the high

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,860
risk patients are the ones that should

00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,750
go to one of these five services after

00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,350
they leave the hospital they're in need

00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:30,750
of some kind of post acute care services

00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:33,839
so this model is built using expert

00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:36,150
opinions and and regression modeling so

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,920
the way it worked is this is similar

00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:40,800
form question we wanted to put a little

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,680
bit different they took each our data

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,680
from the hospitals here and created case

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,540
studies of real patients so D identified

00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,209
them but included all the information on

00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,990
what happened in the hospital

00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:56,700
medications ask medical history labs

00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:58,890
their setting at home what support they

00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,660
have had on how they were functioning at

00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:03,120
home all this data I was put into these

00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:06,089
case studies and then they recruited

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,380
experts both nationally and locally from

00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:10,200
a number of different disciplines so

00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:12,300
nurses physical therapists physician

00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,670
social workers discharge planning

00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,310
experts and all these people had at

00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:18,750
least five years of relevant experience

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:21,900
so really experts in the area of

00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:23,459
discipline and so they were in teams of

00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,920
eight and they all looked at the case

00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:27,900
studies and then said whether they want

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,130
to discharge the patient to home or

00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:33,029
whether they should be referred to

00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:35,520
services and why so after they collected

00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:37,440
all this data they did a first-round and

00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:40,380
if there wasn't agreement they then then

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,209
could do Delphi rounds to get them to

00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,820
discuss what they thought why they would

00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:45,540
refer or not and come to agreement so

00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,550
after that was

00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:50,279
they had prefer not refer and for those

00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:52,259
refer patients had reasons why and they

00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:55,050
did it regression modeling with that and

00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:58,769
came up with six factors in the model

00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:01,110
the word predictive for outcomes post

00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:03,720
hospitalization I mean those were age

00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:05,339
walking ability length of stay the

00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,649
number of comorbid conditions so how

00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:08,339
many different conditions they had

00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:10,829
depression and self-rated health

00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:12,630
assessment so when you asked them how

00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:14,970
they felt how healthy they were it's

00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:18,360
poor fair good and excellent how did

00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:21,060
they rate their own health and so all

00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,550
six of these are things that are easily

00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,949
added into the EHR those are data that

00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:29,839
are attracted by the admitting nurse or

00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:32,730
in daily nurse assessment so this

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,560
predictive model was actually added into

00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,240
the hospital system both here and other

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,190
locations throughout the company or

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,199
throughout the country through a

00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,420
technology transfer company called write

00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:45,149
care solutions and they've been

00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:47,490
continuing to do research and when the

00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:50,579
algorithm was implemented and they've

00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:52,920
shown that it's abbreviated with the d2

00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:56,310
s2 for discharge decision support study

00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,709
but the d2 as to does decrease 30 and 60

00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:03,300
day readmissions leads to better

00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:05,010
outcomes for patients so once we knew

00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,260
who was at risk and who wasn't

00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,760
I mean who to refer and who not the next

00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:12,120
question was where should they be

00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:14,029
referred to so what cash they receive so

00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,880
this process was again very similar

00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:20,430
pulled new EHR records and put together

00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,800
all these case studies and there were up

00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:24,800
to 1200 variables from the nursing

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,350
admission assessment and ongoing

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,329
documentation and as I mentioned it was

00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,699
things like sociodemographics cognitive

00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:35,010
status physical mental health home

00:13:32,699 --> 00:13:37,230
environment and social support things

00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,990
about the caregiver medications medical

00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:41,699
history depression followers and again

00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:43,980
we had team spirit that were very

00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:46,560
interdisciplinary doctors nurses social

00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,990
workers and physical therapists this

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,710
time they were only in teams of three

00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:53,280
and all of the case review was done

00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:55,510
line so they would go in read the case

00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,580
check yes or notes whether they were

00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:59,770
referred where they wanted to refer them

00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:02,290
to then the case came back up with

00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:04,660
checkboxes next to every variable and

00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:06,190
they would go back in and click all the

00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,580
variables that help them make that

00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:11,500
decision and for this one we were using

00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:14,020
EHR records from four different

00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,940
hospitals so how as I mentioned earlier

00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,990
is a big process to merge them even

00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,200
though they were all using the same

00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:22,450
vendor some of them had customized their

00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,130
electronic health records or using

00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:27,130
different versions so the data actually

00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:29,980
didn't only the same I mean through this

00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:31,650
study with question 1 question 2 it was

00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:35,800
found that almost a quarter of patients

00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:37,840
were actually refusing care so they were

00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,060
at high risk of being readmitted they're

00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,280
recommended at post acute referral site

00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:46,060
and they were actually declining those

00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:47,290
services so the next question was you

00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,600
know why are they declining those

00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:52,540
services are those are they declining

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,190
because of preferences and if so can

00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,410
those preferences be incorporated into

00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:58,840
the model so this is the work that I'm

00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:00,400
working on right now the article that's

00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,890
clipped at the top is from a couple

00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,720
months ago and was looking at when

00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:06,970
patients are leaving the hospital what

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,720
information they would want to know and

00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:13,270
for this I interviewed almost 30 older

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,710
adults in the hospital about all kinds

00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:18,010
of questions about what they knew about

00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:19,420
the different post acute care sites what

00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:21,790
they were concerned about and being

00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:24,730
referred what they might want to know

00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:26,290
and so we asked them the two questions

00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,640
that we've been analyzing the top one's

00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,710
done and we're working the second one

00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,600
the first one was when discussing

00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:33,670
options available to you for post

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,230
Hospital services what would you like to

00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,700
know about your care and the services to

00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:38,710
help you make an informed decision and

00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,480
can you tell from the patient point of

00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:44,860
view why someone would not want post

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:47,080
hospital care so the hope is if we know

00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,300
according to the predictive modeling

00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,770
they should go to home care is there a

00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:53,680
way for us to know before approaching

00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:55,080
that patient that maybe they don't are

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,820
comfortable someone coming

00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,920
all they might do better than inpatient

00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,240
setting or the opposite that they really

00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,060
absolutely want to stay in their home

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,670
and we should look at something in the

00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:07,470
community as well as if they have any

00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:09,030
misperceptions about the different sites

00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:12,570
and just generally what they know so we

00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:14,810
can help them except the preferred site

00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:17,100
of care for posted Hospital

00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:19,020
so now I'm going to talk about a couple

00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:22,500
of projects related to predictive

00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:24,200
analytics so the D - s - it was expert

00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,030
opinions and then regression modeling

00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,070
versus just taking all the data that's

00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:31,440
in the HR all these variables and

00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:32,820
running the statistics from that um the

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,250
two examples I'm going to bring up our

00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:36,540
project they worked on at Independence

00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,940
we've crossed here in Philadelphia

00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,590
they're an insurance company I worked

00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:44,640
specifically in Medicare Advantage which

00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:45,900
is the health plans for older adults but

00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,760
a lot of the projects that we've worked

00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,460
on in informatics for across their

00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,590
patient populations and what I think is

00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,820
really exciting about both the do 2s2

00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,950
and the work we're about to talk about

00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:59,490
is that if you can predict these bad

00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:01,140
outcomes as nurses and other health care

00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:03,570
professionals you can intervene before

00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,880
that point so with the d2s - if we know

00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:08,310
that they're gonna have poor outcomes

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,080
likely we can do something ahead of time

00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,410
there which is the same for the next two

00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,900
years

00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:15,870
scenarios so the first one is a

00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:18,449
likelihood hospitalization model this is

00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:20,310
a clip from of the local NPR station

00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:23,430
they did an interview about the model um

00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:25,220
back in April 2015 so predicting the sec

00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:26,970
through personal trials of health data

00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,370
so they have a likelihood of

00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,930
hospitalization model and the

00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:33,240
intervention that they're testing is

00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:36,510
nurse health coaching so they're focused

00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,910
on can eat subgroups they have older

00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,200
adults and non older adults and then

00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:43,770
with each they're looking at for

00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:47,570
diagnoses right now diabetes congestive

00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:52,680
heart failure coronary artery disease or

00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:55,920
cardiac problems heart problems in COPD

00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,330
so long issues so they're predicting a

00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,310
high likelihood of hospitalization and

00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:01,290
they're now testing what nurse health

00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:02,250
coaching can do with intervention to

00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:06,030
prevent hospital

00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:07,830
within six months the second one they

00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:11,880
have been working on a model to predict

00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:14,280
diabetes this article is looking at when

00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:17,430
they created the model they reserved a

00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,260
third of the data to test it so that's

00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:22,410
the data that's included in this article

00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:24,720
I worked on the prospective analysis so

00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:27,090
once they had run the model knew it was

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,610
good they predicted who would have

00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:31,860
diabetes six 12 18 months from that

00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:34,050
point so I looked at how well the model

00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:37,200
was doing as soon as we would hit those

00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:40,680
dates but these are the ROC curves and

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,590
receiver operating curves for the

00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:48,090
predictive diabetes model I'm in there

00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:49,830
comparing it to a baseline parsimonious

00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:53,360
model which is just like the things that

00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:56,130
we know lead to diabetes like obesity

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,480
they took those and saw how predicted

00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:00,900
they were and then if they can make a

00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,460
model that was more predictive so they

00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:07,380
were pretty happy with the model and are

00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:08,940
now looking at outcomes prospectively so

00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,950
um the next topic that I wanted to

00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,710
briefly talk about was open health data

00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:16,920
we're lucky in Philly we have open data

00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:20,100
Philly which is the city puts a lot of

00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:24,240
their data up on this repository and

00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:26,370
they do 26 health data sets overall they

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,690
have 329 data sets that are all

00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:32,810
available with CSV ICSD but even if

00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:35,670
you're not based in Philly nationally

00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:38,820
HHS was just the Health and Human

00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:41,370
Services since 2010 just had a health

00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:44,070
data initiative to open up data and make

00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:46,830
it more publicly available so help

00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,190
thetag of is all of their health related

00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:51,290
data

00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:53,370
there's 2818 datasets as of this morning

00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:55,800
so if you're interested in playing

00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:58,200
around with any healthcare data see if

00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:00,680
you can create any models there's a lot

00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,669
of datasets that are easily available

00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,259
that's kind of what I've been

00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:07,039
around with right now it was learning

00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:09,149
more about Python and data visualization

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:13,019
using some of the open data that's

00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:14,549
available I also wanted to mention using

00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:18,950
Python and Django specifically with

00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:21,480
healthcare data on the right this is an

00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:24,419
the software architecture for a new

00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,609
program called project pavlova that is a

00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:28,679
collaboration between a lab Curt and the

00:20:26,609 --> 00:20:31,350
green lab at data Philly which is a

00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:33,480
meetup group here in Philly in koepfer

00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:35,039
Philly so this just started in the last

00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,200
two weeks they're bringing more groups

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,269
together to work on it but they're

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,730
building it with Django as well as

00:20:39,269 --> 00:20:45,629
machine learning with Python and I

00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:47,999
wanted to mention there's two other

00:20:45,629 --> 00:20:50,850
companies in Philly that use Python for

00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:54,389
their healthcare data pick well helps

00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:55,590
people pick the IDL health insurance for

00:20:54,389 --> 00:20:57,149
themselves and their family by

00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:59,730
predicting what would be the best match

00:20:57,149 --> 00:21:03,029
for them I'm in health Verity I'm less

00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:05,999
familiar with but they also do a ton of

00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:07,769
work with patient data using Python and

00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:10,049
then when I was putting together this

00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:11,940
presentation at Google with Django and

00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:14,669
healthcare because I had canola out

00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,950
there now pop dr. chrono which is an

00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:18,840
electronic health record system that I

00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:21,210
didn't even know was built with Python

00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:23,600
and Django but they are that's pretty

00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,600
