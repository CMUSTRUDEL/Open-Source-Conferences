Description: 
	An Intro to Web Accessibility in Django by Annalee Flower Horne 

Like most developers, I've always known that building accessible web apps is the right thing to do, but I wasn't sure how to do it. I tried my best to add image descriptions and audio transcripts and figured that was good enough. Then I started work on a Django 1.8 project for an agency that has a low-vision website administrator. When we sat her down in front of the app's admin interface for the first time, she had a lot of trouble using it. The contrast was way too low, and control features like sort by column weren't properly labeled. After watching her navigate the admin interface and learning more about how disabled users navigate the web, I customized our app's admin interface to improve accessibility. I've since gotten training in web accessibility, and want to share some of what I've learned so we can all build more accessible apps.

come on

00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:20,369
um I have dyslexia and ADHD so

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,840
accessibility has been something that I

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:24,660
have had to keep in mind basically my

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,390
entire life a few a couple years ago I

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,730
was working on a django app for a client

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,800
who the web administrator is has low

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,880
vision she uses a screen magnifier the

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,710
first time I sat her in front of the

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,329
Django admin interface she couldn't see

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,880
a thing because the light blue on white

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,680
was this is Django 1.8 was not working

00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,960
for her at all so I had to learn a lot

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,550
about how to break down barriers to

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,379
accessibility and build a more

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,989
accessible application I just wanted to

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,969
share some of some of how we do it um

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:52,339
we're talking about accessibility I

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,300
really like this definition

00:00:52,339 --> 00:00:55,859
accessibility inclusive process of

00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,210
removing barriers because it makes it

00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:59,339
about the barriers instead of about the

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,359
person right we can say my disability

00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:02,309
makes it difficult for me to navigate

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,659
the web but actually barriers to

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,280
accessibility make it difficult for me

00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:06,750
to navigate the web we eliminate those

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,020
barriers and suddenly everyone can

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,250
access the web that's great so we're

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,020
gonna talk about some of the different

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,170
disabilities that people have that can

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,430
cause that can have them hitting up

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,860
against barriers when they're trying to

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,180
get trying to get online the first one

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,770
is blind and low-vision users this is

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,610
the one that everybody thinks of think

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,220
of you know you have to make your

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,630
website screen reader friendly being

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,520
accessible to blind and low-vision users

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,990
is actually there's a lot more to it

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,189
evening screen reader friendly although

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,049
being screen reader friendly really

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:36,810
helps so well format of HTML really

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:39,990
helps when you're if you're using you

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,549
know others h1 h2 h3 s screen readers

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,110
will actually parse those to create a

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:44,789
table of contents for the user so that

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,350
they can dip down into the section of

00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:48,420
the page that's relevant to them so

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,890
having those formatted correctly having

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,820
them using them consistently throughout

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,680
the page so that you don't have

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,180
different H ones all over the place so

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,219
that the screen reader knows how to

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,079
press it is a big help for that high

00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:59,460
contrast is another big thing a lot of

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,020
blind and low-vision users you don't use

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,670
screen readers they use magnification

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,409
programs or they zoom up the text and

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,270
having high contrast makes it much

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:09,570
easier to see it they don't have to zoom

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:12,390
so far in descriptive text is another

00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,650
big one here if you're using a screen

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,150
reader one of the things that it does is

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,970
it pulls all the links out of the page

00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,230
and shows them in a list to the user so

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,730
that the user is looking for more

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,800
resources they can just have a handy

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,420
list of links but if your list if your

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,030
list of link looks like click here click

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,590
here click

00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,270
click here first of all don't do that

00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,340
cuz it's bad for SEO it's also really

00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:33,130
bad for screen readers so you want to

00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,959
say you know you have a link to edit

00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,580
your profile you want to say edit your

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,350
profile here and have that whole thing

00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,510
be linked instead of just editing your

00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:43,060
profile here and having that feeling so

00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:44,770
that a blind user screen reader user can

00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,370
see it when they're pulling up that list

00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:49,870
of links last thing is box for two more

00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,730
things relevant image captions are big

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,380
one you see two loads of failure here

00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,360
one is people not including image

00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,580
captions at all the other one is people

00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,239
captioning way too much putting in way

00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:03,340
too much alt text so this slide it's got

00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:05,140
a picture of spectacles on a keyboard if

00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,730
I was cat I'm just putting on alt text

00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,140
to this on a web page that's all that I

00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,489
would say you don't need to put in three

00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,200
paragraphs describing everything about

00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:12,850
this image as all a screen reader needs

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,350
to screen reader user needs to know is

00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:17,110
what about it is relevant to the topic

00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,220
at hand if I was using the same image to

00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,260
illustrate an article well in

00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,630
photography I might instead say an

00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,920
example of a medium depth of field or

00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,360
something that's relevant to that topic

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,170
you don't have to describe the whole

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,400
image because they can't see it anyway

00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:32,920
but there's also things like bullet

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,810
points horizontal rules don't add alt

00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,739
text to those a screen reader users

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,030
already going to know that they're

00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:38,290
reading an unordered list because the

00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,640
screen reader will parse that out of the

00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,140
HTML and tell them they don't need to

00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,220
know what the bullet point looks like if

00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,750
you've got a rogue diamonds as a

00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,850
horizontal rule across your page and you

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,900
put an alt text on each of those and the

00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,730
screen readers might sit there going

00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,019
diamond diamond diamond diamond diamond

00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,910
until it gets to the end of the beat

00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:53,110
yeah that's that's that that's funny

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,310
wants okay but if you actually have to

00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,500
navigate a page like that it's a real

00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,090
pain in the butt and the last thing is

00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,130
being responsive and zoom friendly if

00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,870
you're doing a cut off overflow thing in

00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,340
your CSS and then people zoom the text

00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,810
at the 300 percent so they can read it

00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,920
and suddenly there's gonna be a whole

00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,350
lot of overflow there's gonna be a lot

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,810
of content that they can't see so you

00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:12,609
want to make sure that you're being so

00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,890
the web content accessibility guidelines

00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:16,000
which are produced by w3 they're sort of

00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,950
the gold standard for how to make

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,239
accessible web pages and their standard

00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:23,560
is that your text should be zoomable to

00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:24,580
200% without losing any content we're

00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,380
going to talk a little bit more about

00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,550
screen readers later but I just want to

00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,690
point out if you're on a Mac you

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,210
actually have a screen reader already

00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,800
installed you can turn it on by hitting

00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,140
command f5 don't do that right now we'll

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,400
start talking there's other other free

00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,240
screen readers you can download those

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,430
are really good for

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,630
testing but the caveat here which is

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,310
keep in mind that these are highly

00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,259
customizable programs that people get a

00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,550
lot of practice using so sometimes

00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:46,840
people will tell you oh you should just

00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,460
turn on a screen reader to see how blind

00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,750
people navigate the web it's kind of

00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,330
like telling people you should just put

00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,590
on a blindfold to see how blind people

00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:56,080
navigate the real world right there

00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,699
people have practice and I have training

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,199
how to use these things so just because

00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:00,610
it's hard if you turn it on and you

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,960
don't get discouraged because that

00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,310
doesn't mean that your website is awful

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,690
for everybody it means you don't know

00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,860
how to use a screen reader yet but

00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,210
they're really really good for testing

00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,770
individual elements so it's a good thing

00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,900
to have one installed that you can see

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,909
you're looking for a specific thing like

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,530
you know how do I have this if you have

00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:16,060
this this particular form element

00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:20,050
captioned correctly or all texted

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:22,240
correctly they're good for that color

00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:24,460
blind users there's a lot of different

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,080
kinds of color blindness basically the

00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,550
standard here is don't use color alone

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,110
to distinguish elements if you've got a

00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,789
form where you're putting red text to

00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,530
indicate whether the required fields put

00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:34,479
a star next to it to so that people that

00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,819
see red is gray still know what those

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,770
required fields are basically that's

00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:40,479
that's the long and short of it there's

00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,699
free online tools I've got one at the

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,830
end of the talk of my slides the world

00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:46,270
that will let you put your website

00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,259
through basically a filter that'll show

00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,389
you what it looks like to people with

00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:51,490
various areas of colorblindness most

00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:54,250
people will probably miss though orange

00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:56,229
here they're not usually over on that

00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,320
last one which is complete lack of color

00:05:56,229 --> 00:06:00,400
vision most people can see some color

00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,870
but you want to watch out that you're

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,280
not using colors that are just going to

00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:08,199
read is the same to that one blue and

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,009
green deaf and hard-of-hearing users

00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:11,949
this one's pretty straightforward

00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:14,500
caption your audio content if you can

00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:16,990
accompany it with a transcript as well

00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,210
and the reason I say this if you're

00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,919
trying to get specific information out

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:24,039
of a top having most people read faster

00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:25,719
than I talk so if you if you were trying

00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:27,550
to watch this video later and get

00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,840
specific information out of here you

00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,550
might just want an audio transcript that

00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,080
you beat roll a particular thing you

00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:35,319
want instead of having to watch the

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,849
whole video just to get the captions an

00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:38,440
accompanying nonverbal sounds with

00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:39,580
visual cues everybody's had the

00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,870
experience where they try to click on a

00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,039
button and they get that don't sound

00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,319
which tells them that the buttons not

00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:45,639
clickable if you are hard of hearing or

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,599
deaf or you don't have your headphone

00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,830
that day you're not going to hear that

00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:49,270
noise and so you might sit there just

00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,949
keeping clicking on it wondering why

00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:52,060
it's slow or why it's broken because you

00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:53,409
don't realize that you forgot to check

00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,990
the box that says I accept the Terms of

00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:57,699
Service so you know have something pop

00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,689
up or you know a little red text it says

00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,499
you need to accept these terms before

00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:01,889
you can continue

00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:04,060
don't rely on audio alone for that

00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:06,249
neuro-diverse users this is the category

00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,840
I fire fall into these are people with

00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:09,729
various neurological issues you've got

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,020
low literacy is not a neurologist you

00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,569
obviously but it's on the list because

00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,669
it needs the same kinds of accommodation

00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:16,990
the standard the the web content

00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:19,659
accessibility guidelines for epilepsy

00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:21,009
they ask people to make sure that their

00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:22,810
web is that their elements aren't

00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:24,639
blinking no more than three times a

00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,870
second as if you're blinking really fast

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,930
you can trigger a seizure which is

00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:31,779
obviously bad news bears dyslexia and

00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,979
executive functional disorders as

00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:34,689
something with a DD and somebody with

00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:36,699
dyslexia it's really helpful to me if

00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:38,349
there's a lot of headings and

00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:40,060
subheadings breaking up content control

00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:42,159
F is my best friend I have hard time

00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,479
scaling content my brain just doesn't

00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:44,710
work that way so I need to find a

00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:46,779
specific thing that I'm looking for

00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,129
breaking up content that way also helps

00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:49,479
people with ADHD because when we get

00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:52,089
distracted we'll be able to find our

00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:54,460
place again really fast letting users

00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:56,620
pause or stop anything that's animated

00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,659
or blinking carousels if you've got

00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,849
slideshows it takes me a long time to

00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:02,199
read those things and I've been in

00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:03,310
multiple situations where I'm trying to

00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:04,539
look at something on a slideshow and

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,979
then it moves to the next slide and I

00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:07,509
have no way to stop it so I have to wait

00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:09,729
until it comes around again that it's

00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:13,210
super annoying so let people pause

00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:16,599
things let people hide things my other

00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:17,740
favorite thing is one I'm when I'm

00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:19,330
trying to and what I'm trying to read

00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,339
something and there's a flashing ad over

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,349
here or like scrolling tweets over here

00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:24,520
I get distracted every five seconds and

00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:26,259
I have to find my place again and it

00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,789
takes me forever you can have my ad

00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:31,899
blocker when you stop moving things on

00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:33,610
my page and I'm saving progress one

00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:35,680
sessions expire people that take a

00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:37,120
longer time filling out forms we get

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,709
these little pop ups a lot of times now

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,789
we'll say do you need more time but

00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:41,050
there's still a few little just like

00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:42,279
nope that's it you're logged out make

00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,479
sure that you save our progress so that

00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:45,070
when we log back in we don't have to

00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:48,910
redo it all over again and raise the

00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:50,890
clock so these are some of the different

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,670
kinds of barriers people can experience

00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,560
when they're except

00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:58,240
accessing the web you know talk about oh

00:08:53,560 --> 00:09:01,480
I forgot mom alternative controls people

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,220
that access the web without using either

00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,520
the keyboard and mouse sometimes its

00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:09,040
keyboard only people with arthritis

00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:10,510
people with certain conditions that you

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,130
know paralyzed their hands they'll have

00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,330
or though their have limited movement in

00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,550
their fingers we might have a switch

00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,540
system that plugs into their computer

00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,340
and the computer reads that as a

00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,570
keyboard so you want to make sure that

00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,880
your applications are accessible to

00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:23,530
people there using a keyboard only big

00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,940
thing here is just watch your cursor

00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,770
focus make sure you're not trapping

00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,600
focus if something pops up in a modal

00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:30,160
then they should be able use the

00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,570
keyboard to close that modal and when

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,860
they do it should return focus to

00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,150
whatever they were on before the modal

00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,300
popped up so that it doesn't direct them

00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:38,410
back to the top of the page again

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,210
tooltips and things that where somebody

00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,380
where you have an on hover action you

00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,090
want to make sure that's also a non

00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,410
focus action so if somebody has keyboard

00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:49,290
focus on that item they will see the

00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:51,700
tooltip so those are the big ones there

00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:52,870
I'm going to talk about the admin

00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,330
interface and when I went through this

00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:56,890
accessibility audit of the interface

00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,690
this is actually 1.9 interface which is

00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:01,180
a lot more easier to make accessible

00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:03,730
than 1.8 with we're going to talk about

00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:05,410
you can see up in the very top right

00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,890
corner there left yeah right corner from

00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,260
your side

00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:11,470
that W that is the wave dot webbing or

00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,790
Chrome extension and what that does is I

00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,380
like the Chrome extension you can also

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,910
go to the website itself then plug in

00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,830
your URL but if you use the Chrome

00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,540
extension you can use it on local

00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,490
instances so you can do your development

00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,560
there and what it does is it helps you

00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:25,690
with accessibility audits so the first

00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,010
thing this is just the the standard

00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:30,400
pulls out from another you know Django

00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:31,900
tutorial this is showing us what our

00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,910
HTML looks like that tells us we have

00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,830
two H ones on this page just not ideal

00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:37,510
we want to be using these consistently a

00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,830
page should only have one each one and

00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,970
should go down from there but other than

00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:44,770
that we're actually doing pretty good

00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:45,640
here there's no big read errors set yeah

00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,830
that's what I was just talking about

00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,740
about screen readers want you to be

00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:54,430
using these consistently we do have

00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:59,290
contrast errors here that blue on the

00:10:54,430 --> 00:11:00,940
white is is too too light the web

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,750
content accessibility guidelines they

00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,580
want if

00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,620
4.5 to 1 contrast if you're using the

00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,150
triple-a standards it's 7 to 1 contrast

00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,480
we're using the double-a standards which

00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:15,480
are a little bit more lenient

00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:17,830
fortunately the way tool here actually

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,820
gives you your colors and allows you to

00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,200
play around the lighten and darken

00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,480
colors so that you can get something

00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,370
that's close to your existing color but

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,770
is actually has a good enough contrast

00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:29,020
so in this case we've got a 2.4 to 1

00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:32,490
contrast it's no good we can up it to

00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:36,540
5.4 to 1 make the color a little darker

00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:39,010
and that gets rid of all of our errors

00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,240
and now you can see it this is with the

00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:43,450
darker colors it doesn't look that bad

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,310
right so this is a detailed page and

00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:47,650
here we are getting actual HTML errors

00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,880
we don't have a header on the column

00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,470
that has all the check boxes in it and

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,310
the check boxes themselves are unlabeled

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:56,440
so when a screen reader is going to look

00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:58,590
at these it's also pegging that we have

00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,060
an empty link on the sort by column

00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:03,490
because that that image actually is a

00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,620
it's being set with I believe it's being

00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,730
set with CSS so somebody that is using a

00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,680
screen reader that can't see those

00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:13,300
little arrows doesn't know what that

00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:15,130
what that link does when a screen reader

00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,560
looks at these check boxes that's all it

00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,670
says uncheck checkbox we want to change

00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,530
that so it says uncheck checkbox

00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,270
checkbox who's your favorite Captain

00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,950
Marvel who is your favorite miss Marvel

00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:25,420
so that they have when they're accessing

00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:27,220
the checkbox itself they don't need to

00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:32,260
move from that to figure out what it is

00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:34,900
they're clicking on um we've also got

00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:37,089
some contrast errors here a lot of them

00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,680
actually so these are actually pretty

00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,360
easy to fix because the admin doesn't

00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,839
use that many colors so you can find and

00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,760
replace the colors pretty fast however

00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:47,560
we've got some issues here when we make

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,730
that breadcrumb light enough that it

00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,740
doesn't have a contrast error anymore

00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,240
suddenly it looks exactly like the rest

00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,980
of the breadcrumbs so what I did is I

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,600
added an underline there people can tell

00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,130
their own questions now and they're not

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,580
on home or polls but they can click back

00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:02,380
to those now I'm here in the filter list

00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:04,030
you'll see it's a light blue on grey

00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:07,720
well I had to up it to a dark blue on a

00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:09,220
darker and a darker gray but once you

00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,930
when you do that when we then desaturate

00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,220
it somebody that's colorblind might not

00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,570
be able to see that dark blue so

00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,370
it might just look like brain Bray and

00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:17,140
they're not going to tell which thing be

00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:19,510
able to tell which item in that list

00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:22,420
they're actually on so I just also made

00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:25,120
that item bolt make it a little bit more

00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,450
obvious and that's what this looks like

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,100
with all of those accessibility updates

00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:36,430
um doesn't look bad right looks pretty

00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:38,470
good um so yeah I talked really fast so

00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,730
this is just the detail page again it's

00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:41,620
got a whole bunch of unlabeled form

00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,940
elements that we want to fix but that

00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,260
doesn't look very pretty when I fix it

00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,930
but it doesn't look like anything I fix

00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,370
it so here's some accessibility

00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,750
resources and has a metric time for

00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:55,240
questions apparently I talked with you

00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:59,320
best the over the last link the Django

00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:01,840
admin 508 github repository you can

00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,730
actually just install that as a tap in

00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,730
your project and it will override your

00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:08,550
Django admin styles for you to give you

00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:13,090
the darker blue that you just saw here

00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:15,250
and then here's some web home chrome

00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:16,510
plug-in color scheme designer and

00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:19,150
Palatine is one of the ones where you

00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:20,080
can filter your your page to see what it

00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,870
looks like to put a little different

00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,340
kinds of colorblindness w3.org has all

00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,570
of these accessibility guidelines up

00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:28,750
online and they're actually pretty easy

00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:29,920
to search through so it's something

00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,600
where you can go and look at those I

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,400
mean you know reading a bunch of Doc's

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,770
ism isn't terribly fun but these Doc's

00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,300
are pretty thorough and they've got

00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,010
really good suggestions so if you can

00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,510
check through those we've got a question

00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:42,220
about okay I know this element is a

00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:45,160
problem how do I fix it they will have

00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,660
some good guidelines for you all right

00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:51,210
well that's all I have so if anybody has

00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:51,210
any questions yeah we do

00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:03,320
so we do have ten minutes for questions

00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:05,120
we can get a few in for recording

00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,570
purposes please let me bring you the mic

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:12,920
so all right Russ and then we've got one

00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:14,450
back here um thanks for that the IDI

00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,980
generated obviously you've got there as

00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,480
an external package that can overlay

00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,160
have you submitted that as a patch

00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,630
upstream to be booked out

00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:24,920
I haven't yet I'm still working on it

00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:26,360
the HTML isn't all of the CSS is up it's

00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,780
fixed up there but the HTML still need

00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,280
some work

00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,900
like I said this is a work in progress

00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:38,870
you but you're working towards that okay

00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:41,360
fantastic Thanks so so it looks like a

00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:45,560
lot of this work is pretty much HTML

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:48,800
work do the CSS have a fair amount of

00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,840
effect on it and if so how do the CSS

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,490
frameworks and stuff like that play into

00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:55,370
that do they make the situation better

00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:57,080
or worser so mostly when you're looking

00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:58,160
at CSS you're looking at color contrast

00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,290
as most of what you're going to hit

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,690
sometimes if you've got that overflow

00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:04,700
cutoff that happens in CSS you want to

00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,380
avoid that or at least make it so that

00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:09,260
your text can zoom up to at least 200

00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,520
percent without triggering it but mostly

00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,020
it's just setting colors that have a

00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,700
high enough contrast and you can do that

00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:18,770
in pretty much any front-end framework

00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:21,200
hi uh thank you enjoyed your talk I do

00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:23,480
work at a non-profit and I was curious

00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,770
if you are if you would name any

00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,650
nonprofits that you feel like have

00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:29,000
especially good websites in terms of you

00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:32,390
know the full range of the public being

00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,950
able to access them the National

00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:36,950
Federation for the blind actually

00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:38,780
obviously that's a really good but

00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:40,820
they're a resource that I went to and

00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,430
they do a lot of where they will have

00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,170
the version of the page that is that is

00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,190
meant for people to look at and then

00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,110
they have the version of the page that

00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:51,200
is meant to be read to somebody which

00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,400
just strips out all of the CSS in it but

00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,170
it's not just like the page without the

00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,970
CSS it's formatted differently so that

00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,710
the screen reader can read it and get

00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,370
everything you usually don't have to go

00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,230
that far

00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,060
usually if you're using if you're

00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,500
setting up your HTML properly then you

00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,329
can have the same page that's screen

00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,839
reader accessible and also human

00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:07,839
readable

00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:11,579
one thing that I didn't hear you call it

00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,520
explicitly in your talk but I imagine

00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:15,959
you have some experience with Azaria and

00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,929
I'm wondering sort of what your

00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:20,630
experience has been with that and any

00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:23,549
difficulties you might have come across

00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:25,829
so REI is a screen reader program um I

00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:27,809
actually use the one that comes built-in

00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:32,010
on the map so I haven't been using Aria

00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:33,960
at all recently Aria is sort of the big

00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:37,650
most common screen reader program and it

00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:40,260
has some screen reader specific HTML

00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:41,850
tags that it supports for instance

00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,559
alternative link text because right now

00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:45,000
this is something that a lot of people

00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:45,990
want is alt text for links because they

00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,370
want to be able to use links in

00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,960
paragraphs and then also have a separate

00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,730
alt text it'll tell people what it

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,350
actually links to right now screen

00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:54,059
readers try to mimic what the page

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,320
actually looks like so they don't pick

00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:57,020
up alt text on links they're going to

00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,500
pick up the actual text of the link

00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,179
that's annoying

00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,740
Aria has an option where you can

00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,270
actually add an aria tag to that that

00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,100
will read something different the danger

00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:07,080
there is that those aren't universally

00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,179
supported tags so you can stick in Aria

00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,559
tags for RA to read but somebody that is

00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:12,780
on a Mac and is using a different screen

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,250
reader the screen reader might not pick

00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:18,299
it up for instance the Mac standard one

00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:21,799
doesn't pick up Aria tags so my question

00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:23,880
is given the kind of list you have of

00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:27,150
accessibility issues that were

00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,640
confronted with and especially for pages

00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:32,309
or applications that haven't addressed

00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,710
those ever what would be you know the

00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:37,350
best bang for your buck of in terms of

00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:39,929
low-hanging fruit low-hanging fruit

00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,909
clean up your HTML make sure that you're

00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:42,840
using well formatted HTML that the

00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:46,020
screen reader is going to have an easy

00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,159
time parsing um I think color contrast

00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,450
is low-hanging fruit but that's going to

00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,450
depend on how picky your designers are

00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:55,890
other low-hanging fruit is getting good

00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:57,419
captions on your images just the images

00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,429
that have specific content you basically

00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:01,710
if it has text in it you want to caption

00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:02,850
it if it has meaningful content you want

00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,650
to caption it if it's something that's

00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,270
illustrating something but doesn't have

00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:08,039
a lot of meaningful content you just

00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,330
need like a sentence that says what it

00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,559
is so that people can tell that it

00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,030
doesn't have meaningful content in it

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,460
other things that are just there to

00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:17,220
visually set up the page visually

00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:20,510
organize a page for sighted users you

00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:23,000
don't need to caption them so we

00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:25,880
two final questions queued up we could

00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,170
take a third only so fast but we'll get

00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,890
these two and then we could take one

00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:33,920
more potentially afterwards so you

00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:35,720
mentioned that it's it's good to test

00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,480
your pages with a screen reader and you

00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,580
also mention that it's it's people who

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,090
use those things regularly are going to

00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:46,040
be much more fluent with them so do you

00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:49,250
know of any organizations where have you

00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:51,710
worked with anyone that uses a screen

00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:54,320
reader regularly or uses these assistive

00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:56,300
technologies regularly to actually test

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,610
your pages sort of before you would go

00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:00,500
to production I don't know of anybody

00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:02,390
who offers that as a service you know I

00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,450
know individual friends that I can ask

00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:07,490
but that's a good question I will I will

00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:16,640
try to dig that up and put it on the

00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:18,020
Gengo Twitter okay I find it a lot of

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,020
what blind readers do when they're using

00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,760
screen readers is just speed the way up

00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:24,340
because we read most of us not me but

00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,950
most people read faster than they talk

00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:29,540
and so they will just they get used to

00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,340
hearing it and so they speed it up and

00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:33,350
so if you if you just turn on your

00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:36,160
screen reader at a normal speed most

00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:38,210
people who speeds up their podcasts yeah

00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,410
yeah it's the same thing if you turn on

00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:42,440
a screen reader at a normal speed it's

00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:44,000
gonna take forever to really thank you

00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,100
very much um I was wondering if you

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,760
could talk about JavaScript single page

00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:53,930
applications how excessively changes in

00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:57,290
on such such such an environment

00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:59,450
so my experience with the the Django run

00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:00,830
or Django framework or JavaScript

00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,560
frameworks like that is that they're an

00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:04,970
accessibility mess they're not always an

00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:10,790
accessibility mess one thing that the

00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:12,519
wave doohickey that I just forgot the

00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:14,990
word for

00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:16,370
does is it tests the page after it's

00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,570
been rendered words if you plug it into

00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,830
a checker that doesn't render the

00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:20,210
JavaScript first it's going to throw a

00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,049
lot of errors that don't exist or it's

00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:25,399
just not gonna be able to find any

00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:26,960
content so yeah the Chrome extension I

00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:28,309
think there's a Firefox extension to are

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,779
both really handy for that because it'll

00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:31,669
actually let the page load before it

00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:33,919
starts reading them most screen readers

00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:40,429
are smart enough now to also do the same

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:42,080
thing all right one final question so my

00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:44,779
question is just from an implementation

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,730
standpoint if you have clients or

00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:48,500
colleagues that have designed a page it

00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:50,690
looks very good but you want to actually

00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,940
start moving towards accessibility is

00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:55,519
there like the mode you described a few

00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:57,590
moments ago like a high contrast node or

00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:59,360
an accessibility mode is that a standard

00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:02,210
that's laid out or is that a pattern

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,950
that you see used that's something that

00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,659
some people do is they will offer you

00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:08,389
know a higher contrast mode or a larger

00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:10,070
text mode it tends to be better to just

00:22:08,389 --> 00:22:12,230
make your page accessible out of the box

00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:13,760
but if you have really really purse miss

00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,409
persnickety designers you end up

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,570
sometimes with that compromise of at

00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:18,679
least offering a different different

00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:21,130
version of the page that has higher

00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:22,429
contrast easy to start and then yeah

00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:25,010
yeah

00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:27,320
I love designers I'm not knocking on

00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:31,850
designers sometimes y'all like your

00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:33,769
colors a little too much on alia there

00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,230
are unanswered questions in the room

00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:37,909
