	DjangoCon US 2016 - Beyond Po: How to Make Django Work For Right-To-Left Languages by Cho Garcia & Payam

LANGUAGE DETECTION

How to address URL based translation and Django language detection easily.

RTL LANGUAGE DIRECTION

Most of them are speaking in a language which is written right to left so itâ€™s not enough to just translate your app to their language. You should change the style of your app to display them in a correct format. Some graphic elements should be flipped horizontally to make sense for them.

CHARACTER ENCODING ISSUES

When you are working with a language with completely different form of alphabet and characters there is a huge chance that you face an issue if you donâ€™t abide some encoding standards.

CALENDAR SYSTEM

Some of those countries have their own calendar which is completely different from gregorian calendar which is used in most of west countries. There are some apps helping you to convert unix timestamp to those different calendar format in both backend and frontend side

INTERFACE DESIGN AND PROPER FONTS

As their language is RTL some graphic elements need to be mirrored. Although it is true for most of layout parts but there are still some sections that needs to keep their direction, like mathematical equations, multimedia players progress bar, â€¦ Using modern frontend tools like SASS mixin to automatically float elements depending on the language direction.

come on

00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:20,760
so this is my first time speaking in the

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,150
conference and this is really impressive

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,759
although not much people here now and

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,880
that is worried for me as well as you

00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:33,540
can imagine so with this talk I

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:36,600
basically to provide tips and tricks

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:40,140
from my experience working with right to

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,210
left languages and I think everyone

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,090
knows who to make a general work with

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:48,420
multilingual like multilingual side and

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,370
not maybe not everyone with the right to

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,760
left work everything need to switch and

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:57,449
everything needs to adapt for them to

00:00:52,760 --> 00:01:00,870
rate and work with it properly so I will

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:05,690
address scalability settings very

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:08,940
briefly it is jungle dogs are great

00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:11,130
direction in text editors characters in

00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:18,420
coding issues especially with Python

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:20,659
Python 2.7 and different system for

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:26,159
calendars for example from my own

00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:27,960
experience I work with so my foundation

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,299
work focused on Middle East countries

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:34,680
and North Africa countries that means

00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:37,350
sometimes we need to work with person

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,170
and that is rightful eft and they do

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:44,130
have a different calendar so all that

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:47,549
we've been addressing this talk year old

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:50,789
based language and and finally some

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:53,369
front-end tricks I really hope this is

00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:55,350
helpful for you guys and any feedback

00:01:53,369 --> 00:02:01,159
questions comments are we much

00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:05,340
appreciate it ok so a bit about me as

00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:07,890
you said I'm UX designer and self-made

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,710
full stack developer so everything I

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,410
learned I learned for myself during ten

00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:16,890
years coding because I love codeine and

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:20,190
the last four years working with general

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:27,420
and that is a pleasure

00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:29,940
I'm a Django yeah my my company is more

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,100
media foundation is a number of it based

00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:36,920
in London providing research training

00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,920
technology and in at-risk communities

00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:47,610
okay so there we start your many of you

00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,880
guys have worked with Django and

00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:57,660
right-to-left languages yeah not that

00:02:50,880 --> 00:03:00,270
many that's good as very well stated in

00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,250
Django dogs translation depends from the

00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:04,920
target of language and formatting

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:09,380
usually depends on the target country

00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:11,910
and that is totally correct right

00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,830
different calendar systems so we really

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:18,200
need to know what the target is what

00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,200
their days audiences in order to address

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:34,200
interface and problems for them so there

00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:37,560
you go blam blam blam we need to know

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,239
what the client wants they usually don't

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,970
know what they want so we need to

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,510
actually determine what they want how

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:49,290
many languages they are going to have

00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:52,320
now and in the future that means your

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,030
system need to scale obviously and it

00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,910
needs to be ready to add more languages

00:03:54,030 --> 00:04:00,540
in the future in especially if they are

00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:02,910
right or left regarding the content our

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,230
data stations going to be linked that

00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,450
means they're gonna translate

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:08,100
side-by-side or they're going to be

00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:11,430
totally separated that means we're gonna

00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:14,550
have same model but they can create for

00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:25,250
example a person article or a English

00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:25,250
article so the answer to these questions

00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:33,650
determine the good approach that we need

00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:33,650
to choose on the on-site

00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:41,139
actually having a multi side with Django

00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:44,020
sites that is going to solve some

00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:46,479
problems that is going to cause another

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:49,479
many problems that means you're going to

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:54,070
need to have different settings and that

00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:57,430
is probably in most of the cases from my

00:04:54,070 --> 00:05:02,350
experience a pain in the ass that is

00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:04,900
because for example a recent project we

00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,850
had it was a really huge massive

00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:11,320
database and winning the to migrate and

00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:14,050
we had two sides for Farsi an English

00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:17,289
person an English and in that case

00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,669
running like 10 Jagger management

00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:22,570
comments who was really a painting

00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:24,160
there's problems so actually you need to

00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:26,520
think I'm not saying that the genocides

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:31,060
are they are good for different purposes

00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,979
but you really need to know what you

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,560
need what your approaches and what is

00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:38,380
the right solution for you according to

00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:42,340
your specifications of the project you

00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:46,510
are work on we can consider having one

00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:50,500
language one app that also works that

00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:55,500
means removing Jang size of having one

00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:59,940
language and one app and select them

00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:02,710
with the URLs that is a good approach or

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:05,020
shall we consider a su domain based

00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:07,180
which is essentially the same but you

00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:13,030
know just different settings for engine

00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:14,860
X or deployment or using packages like

00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:22,750
Django subdomains or whatever you want

00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:24,669
to use 273 subdomains properly and the

00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:30,550
last point in here should waitress lady

00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:32,620
roles from my experience is not a good

00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:37,419
idea generally talking is never a good

00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:40,330
idea and that is because imagine person

00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:44,440
is not a Latin character language and

00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:46,330
medium you have a huge Unicode strings

00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,439
in your eros and

00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:49,870
is going to be really long and runny

00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:54,610
ugly and no one is going to understand

00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:59,409
what Dad Ling is so it's not a good idea

00:06:54,610 --> 00:07:01,360
also for Google and for the seat system

00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:03,280
itself you want to keep you know because

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,310
it's a multilingual side you want to

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,849
keep your your absolute URLs preferably

00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:12,520
in the main language a Latin character

00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:17,949
language for example English and then

00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:25,060
have your different URLs for for the

00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:31,979
different languages again you will also

00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:37,330
want to use for long Latin languages in

00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:41,580
absolute URLs something like IDs for the

00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:44,439
same problem and avoiding Unicode along

00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,279
euros and also for Shyam propose some

00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:53,830
social media and stuff so we usually use

00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:55,539
IDs at this more media so all of these

00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:59,860
considerations obviously depend on the

00:07:55,539 --> 00:08:01,870
specifications of the project I would

00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:06,909
like just point a few things that you

00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:10,029
should do and you shouldn't do I will

00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:12,849
always think about the simplest

00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:17,589
implementation don't over complicate

00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:20,229
things keep your system and dependencies

00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:22,810
as simple as possible try to reduce

00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:26,469
complexity as much as you can whenever

00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:28,479
you can't so in that sense add a

00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:31,389
distillation approach that doesn't not

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:34,750
impact the core of your system and this

00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:39,250
means at relations without changing the

00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:42,519
existing models or views this will cause

00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:44,320
less pain if if you modify your your

00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:49,060
component that manages the translations

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:53,079
and in the future and you also need to

00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:56,890
support inheritance of your models you

00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:59,570
also won't consider two stores relations

00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:02,930
in the same table just to avoid x

00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:05,330
pensive joins when working with big

00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:10,640
databases that's another problem we had

00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:13,460
and it was a really big one you know

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,390
especially in the in when migrations are

00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:20,180
in the admin where you have lists or

00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:22,160
many in line models so in that case you

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:25,390
probably can build your you know own

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:32,240
views or own and with that is that means

00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:34,490
you need more time and again don't

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,910
translate it eros apparent apart from

00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:40,850
other things that will mention after

00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:46,790
this does not work for non Latin

00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:48,980
characters as I said yeah so yeah

00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:52,850
essentially having your specifications

00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:55,310
in mind choose your right component to

00:09:52,850 --> 00:10:00,470
handle painless modern translations or

00:09:55,310 --> 00:10:04,880
write your own approach having all of

00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:08,690
this in mind that you jump you want to

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:15,770
have your component for translations a

00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:18,710
part of your main core system there are

00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:22,850
some solutions out there that you can

00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:25,130
choose or maybe you can not because you

00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:26,870
don't like them I will say that the

00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:29,810
first one is more the generation that is

00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:32,750
less obstructive that means you need to

00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:36,710
edit your models or change anything is

00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:39,770
working with registration approach where

00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:44,330
do you register your files and that's

00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:49,730
all about that each but you need to

00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:54,320
modify your your model and keep in mind

00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:56,900
that this does not support many Django

00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,290
admin features so you won't be able

00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:02,360
unless you you I shall develop that to

00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:07,730
support it you won't be able to search

00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:10,640
field translated fields and then the

00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,499
last one is parlor is very similar to H

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,689
but it

00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:17,179
stores all translations in a separate

00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:21,799
table that means probably expensive

00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:24,979
joints again so again depend on your

00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:27,549
specifications from my personal space i

00:11:24,979 --> 00:11:31,339
will refer to have them in the same

00:11:27,549 --> 00:11:35,419
table so then quite sets are much easier

00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:41,539
and faster actually you can professional

00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:56,179
that but again think about scalability

00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:58,629
and mind settings very briefly you work

00:11:56,179 --> 00:12:03,979
online the world you have have to be

00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:07,099
there and that is after the session and

00:12:03,979 --> 00:12:11,119
before the common all in Django dogs I

00:12:07,099 --> 00:12:14,659
won't say anything that obviously is i

00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:18,049
think is active by default a school and

00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:22,999
then add your languages and you notice

00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:28,159
here the EU get text easy what's the

00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:34,549
difference of your you get text and you

00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:38,089
get text lazy so the first one is mainly

00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:42,439
phone forms or models they call the code

00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:47,899
of these definitions is only executed

00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:49,759
once mostly on jungle startup and every

00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:52,309
time you access the name of the of the

00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:57,919
attributes on a model the string will be

00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:59,269
newly translated so you might be looking

00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:04,059
at this mall in different languages

00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:08,299
since django was started and the other

00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:10,999
you get text is mostly for be using

00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:15,709
function function calls so every time

00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:17,719
the view is called we be newly executed

00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:22,389
so you will always get the right

00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:22,389
translation fitting the request

00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:32,679
right so you're a simple welcome to my

00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:39,559
side and that will be collected with

00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:48,349
genomic messages command so here's where

00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:50,749
the fun part starts the direction the

00:13:48,349 --> 00:13:53,299
fair question is do you really need

00:13:50,749 --> 00:13:56,419
Django admin to mail right to left that

00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:59,119
is supported actually but since it's a

00:13:56,419 --> 00:14:01,999
multilingual website and they need to

00:13:59,119 --> 00:14:03,469
translate I mean it small most of the

00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:06,349
cases always depended your

00:14:03,469 --> 00:14:09,649
specifications but you probably don't

00:14:06,349 --> 00:14:11,329
and you probably want to have just this

00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:13,309
relation side by side they can translate

00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:16,209
if in the case of the context is linked

00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:21,669
or you wanna have and you just create

00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:24,889
the right to left items in a separated

00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:28,009
Django admin view where you actually can

00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:32,569
switch the direction of the forum in

00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:35,329
just the form and that means is really

00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:38,659
annoying for them it's not that annoying

00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:41,659
when they have a text field to write in

00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:45,319
the wrong direction for them but is in

00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:48,049
text editors like that they need to have

00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:52,219
the right direction so that is quite

00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:54,169
easy to do with the settings of the text

00:14:52,219 --> 00:15:00,409
editor you obviously need to choose one

00:14:54,169 --> 00:15:05,959
that supports right to left ckeditor or

00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:07,969
go and that is the bit actually you need

00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:12,759
to just change the language this

00:15:07,969 --> 00:15:15,379
approach will work perfectly if the

00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:18,229
content is not linked so design model

00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:24,019
can be you know person or English they

00:15:18,229 --> 00:15:25,789
can just select the the language and

00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:33,129
then change the direction and then saved

00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:33,129
the item and the soul so some issues

00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:43,379
yes I've been working with Python 2.7

00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:51,360
but I emigrating now and that is that

00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:55,649
means a lot of issues with encoding so

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:59,519
you probably will get this nice one is

00:15:55,649 --> 00:16:02,610
the Unicode their code error I got that

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,490
many many times and drew drove me crazy

00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:08,279
actually so there is a really really

00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:10,170
good article I think the best article I

00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:14,850
found which is that one if you want to

00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:17,689
check out the is Derek doler it's a

00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:22,259
really good article that explains easily

00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:25,160
how you can replicate this obviously

00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:30,689
I've been replicating this every day but

00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:35,339
so you said you set up your variables

00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:37,680
right you plug in a unicode into another

00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:41,850
unicode that works fine as you can see

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:45,269
you plug in UDF into an order etf as

00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:55,819
wars no problem you can plug unicode

00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:58,740
into a UTF right sequence but plug-in

00:16:55,819 --> 00:17:01,620
UTF swing into a unique it doesn't work

00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:07,980
so well and that is one of the cases

00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:10,319
where did you get that nice one so again

00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:14,760
that's the article via wanna write that

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:22,770
down if you don't want this trouble just

00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:25,439
migrated to buy from three solution if

00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:28,830
some variables are white sequences

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:31,919
instead of Unicode objects convert them

00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:38,030
to unicode objects with decode before

00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:38,030
handle them so as you can see there

00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:48,940
python3 solves this problem by becoming

00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:52,179
more explicit string literals are now

00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:58,779
unicode by default while byte sequence

00:17:52,179 --> 00:18:01,690
are stored in a new type call bite dates

00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:12,669
this is a really fun one too so this is

00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:18,269
today date right yeah that is the Jolly

00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:21,370
calendar the person calendar that means

00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:25,929
they daily day data select dates like

00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:29,259
that right and jaguar jaguar wind so a

00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:33,129
cc is as possible do you want to provide

00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:36,970
them with the tools to select that i

00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:41,590
will recommend their widgets date

00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:45,070
pickers that supports a lily calendar

00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:46,990
and many other different calendars but i

00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:49,179
won't recommend that because you want to

00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:52,240
minimize your pain right and you will

00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:56,500
end up probably with problems so this

00:18:52,240 --> 00:19:00,220
this library specifically for jalili

00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:03,700
calendar and is most of the cases that

00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:08,769
will just provided job down you know day

00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:12,539
month and year drop downs and then when

00:19:08,769 --> 00:19:17,789
saving compared that with this into the

00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:20,190
over calendar we got google calendar um

00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:23,850
let's talk about international

00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:29,139
internationalization and euros patterns

00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:31,509
append a language code or fix does most

00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:40,409
of the cases you want to do you can also

00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:40,409
can do subdomains so that's cool easy

00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:47,799
and about translating URLs again there's

00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:51,250
a big warning in Jang dogs in most cases

00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:53,080
suspect to use translated eros only

00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:57,639
within a language called prefixed block

00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:59,350
of patterns using I 18 and patterns this

00:19:57,639 --> 00:20:03,279
is to avoid the possibility that the

00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:07,029
translated URLs cause a collision with a

00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:11,409
non-related URL pattern so generally

00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:13,929
talking about translating URLs you want

00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:16,840
to keep the same for all languages in a

00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:22,809
main language in a Latin character

00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:27,940
language and then serve the rest with so

00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:30,519
cool fronting tips that we find out

00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:34,750
party helpful and I hope is also for you

00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:38,169
guys so this is simple here you can get

00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:41,039
the current language you can also get

00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:45,389
the direction of the current language

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,389
they actually the gate current language

00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,610
direction is it returns true or false so

00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:56,139
that's why you can see there if blah

00:20:51,610 --> 00:21:00,100
blah blah RTL or LTR right you can also

00:20:56,139 --> 00:21:05,019
make a template tag just for your

00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:09,340
searching proposes here you can see that

00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:13,080
time selecting the dynamically when the

00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:15,850
templates are rendered that append the

00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:21,669
RTL or LTR that means you can actually

00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:24,039
use any task runner like gold or web

00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:27,909
back or wherever and compile yourselves

00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:30,700
and your JavaScript files like that and

00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:37,360
then just selecting dynamically

00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:41,470
depending on the language and hear some

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:46,210
sass good things and really easy

00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:50,649
actually but it's good to mention so

00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:53,260
imagine that your app dot RTL sass file

00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:54,070
is your entry point for your gout to

00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:57,940
collect all of the

00:21:54,070 --> 00:22:01,090
or web pack and that is what you said is

00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:05,770
right to left to a different font size

00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:09,790
because usually they need a bigger size

00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:14,260
and then you can import your you know

00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:17,680
specific right to left styles for that

00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:20,080
language in the other way for English

00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,780
you can for the other direction I mean

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:29,080
you can set that to false and then

00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:34,210
import your specific SAS AC and here

00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:39,730
this sucks SAS mix-ins can probably

00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:41,650
decrease your development time by fifty

00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:44,680
percent that means you don't have to

00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:47,830
write different styles for different for

00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:54,310
the two directions right so you can use

00:22:47,830 --> 00:23:02,140
that nicely and say include Margie left

00:22:54,310 --> 00:23:05,610
value and if that will actually do that

00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:08,380
just that check and apply left or right

00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:15,970
depending on the direction that is

00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:21,310
pretty cool and really easy to use so

00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:23,230
yeah that is my statement anyone can

00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,940
make the simple complicated but I

00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:29,590
creativity is making a complicated

00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:33,850
simple think really simple and achieved

00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:35,970
your goals and don't be in trouble thank

00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,970
you

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:45,749
we have any questions comments feedback

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:51,869
yeah we do have time for about two

00:23:45,749 --> 00:23:56,460
questions so my question has to do with

00:23:51,869 --> 00:23:57,629
model translations have you either had

00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,179
the opportunity to run into any issues

00:23:57,629 --> 00:24:01,679
with translating maybe models from

00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:05,340
third-party apps that bring in

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:08,399
migrations that you don't control bring

00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:10,769
say how do you have you added

00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:13,080
model-based translations to any apps

00:24:10,769 --> 00:24:17,700
that are reusable apps that you've

00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:20,190
installed from outside the project if it

00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:24,269
depends on your approach right and that

00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:26,669
what i mean about so i'm using model

00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:29,009
django model translation see asian that

00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:31,019
then you can register your fields right

00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:33,899
I guess that yeah so the the conflict is

00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:36,450
that if it's a we add a translation that

00:24:33,899 --> 00:24:38,399
adds migrations to add fields but right

00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:41,519
then you have migrations but if if this

00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:45,779
was a reusable app in that case you

00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:48,029
probably want to extend that model

00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:50,519
create your own inside your app and then

00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:57,029
does its relation right did you

00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:59,460
important yeah sorry one more thanks a

00:24:57,029 --> 00:25:01,019
lot for the presentation um so a

00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,909
question and this is sort of like this

00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:05,220
is just more about like translations in

00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:08,129
general like I've noticed like a lot in

00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:10,739
the last couple years that uh browsers

00:25:08,129 --> 00:25:12,419
are getting better at identifying that

00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:14,369
it's a different language displaying on

00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:17,190
the page and they'll prompt you to say

00:25:14,369 --> 00:25:19,529
like okay hey you know it looks like

00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:20,999
this pages in French but your English do

00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:24,659
you want us to do the translation and

00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:27,239
I'm wondering like how much if you know

00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:30,570
how mature that is and because obviously

00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:32,879
you know like for for clients it might

00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:34,859
uh it costs money to you know do all

00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:37,320
these translations and that they like

00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:39,239
the idea of just having an automatic

00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:45,059
thing and where that's where the state

00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:48,179
of that is add that is probably not a

00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:51,359
good idea Jim in translation on the fly

00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:52,179
right yes yeah like it's that is usually

00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:53,470
the elusive

00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:56,740
knows that for example Google Earth

00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:59,860
later does not just laid properly right

00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:02,740
especially for you know Arabic speakers

00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,230
or make idioms there in language monk

00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:10,629
it's even too English to Spanish

00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:13,869
sometimes is really fun mmm so it is not

00:26:10,629 --> 00:26:19,809
