Description: 
	Making a Splash with your Open Source Project by Russell Keith Magee

So you've written a bunch of code, and you think others might find it useful. You open source it, and... profit, right? Well, no. PyPI is filled with thousands of projects that have been released with the best of intentions, but never really break into the mainstream. How do you escape this trap, and maximize the chance that your project will actually be used, grow and thrive?

come on

00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:19,710
well hello again Philadelphia as you

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,510
said my name is Russell Keith McGee if

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,369
you've heard my name before it's because

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,930
of a member of the Django core team and

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,610
I have been coming up on 11 years now

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,910
I've served on the Technical Review

00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:32,310
Board with a 1.7 1.8 1.9 releases I'm

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,570
also on the security team Django is an

00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,280
open source project but it's not the

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,309
only open source project I'm associated

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,440
with these days i'm mostly spending my

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:42,360
time on the beware project beware is an

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,890
open-source collection of tools and

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,280
libraries for creating native user

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:50,210
interfaces in python desktop also for

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,260
iOS Android and single page web apps and

00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,489
I've been associated with a bunch of

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,260
other open-source projects over the

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,649
years as a user a contributor and

00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,690
project maintainer so earlier today I

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,909
spoke about some of the known and

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,050
factual aspects of open source projects

00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:07,200
that you need to be aware of things like

00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:09,060
legal issues and answers and so burnout

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,800
and depression issues these are well

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,320
study have well known causes well known

00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,869
resolutions there's all very great

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,240
factory stuffy this talk however isn't

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:21,659
about that hard data this is about how

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,070
to make your project successful now the

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,969
thing that I want to flag here up front

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:29,040
is the very distinct wispy cargo Coptic

00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:30,930
cargo cults are over is a phenomena that

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,939
came out of World War two there were a

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,320
lot of pacific islands filled with

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,750
people who weren't you know modern

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,040
Western civilization's and their first

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,689
experience with meeting Western

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,579
civilization's was that these people

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:43,469
would turn up and these these large

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,899
metal sky birds would come down and

00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:48,000
deliver large amounts of food housing

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,250
materials and and all sorts of the

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,960
vehicles interesting things and then a

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,060
couple years later they all disappeared

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,969
again so they started building these

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,680
giant bamboo structures to try and bring

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:00,930
the sky birds back again when they'd

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,090
flatten out large pieces of land and

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,350
setting burning pyres that are along the

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,659
side because they see there was always

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,310
likes at the side of these worthy sky

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,730
birds would land so we ended up with

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,350
entire cultures building landing strips

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,580
for planes that were never going to come

00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,550
because they didn't understand why the

00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,260
planes were coming in the first place

00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,970
cargo counting in technology is can be

00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,910
very very easy to do you sit there and

00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:25,440
you say okay I this was

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:29,040
project did this this project is

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,570
successful therefore I must do this the

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,950
one thing that I will assert and I hope

00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,320
is not talking but controversial is you

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,400
can't be an underpants night for those

00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,860
who don't know about underpants gnomes

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,570
to judge from South Park the underpants

00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,160
gnomes are these little creatures that

00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,650
sneaking your bedroom at night and they

00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,480
steal your underpants why because

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:49,680
they've got a business plan step 1 they

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:53,160
steal the underpants step two step three

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,530
profit they can't ever explain what step

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,300
two is that if you're really really

00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,360
lucky you might have a massive success

00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,160
just accidentally happen to you but more

00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,020
is more realistically you're going to

00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,480
have to work at it and that preparation

00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,250
starts with knowing what kind of project

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,990
is created and what sort of what your

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,470
commitment to that project is going to

00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:15,980
be now I would argue there are two main

00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:18,420
sources of open source project release

00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,490
the first is the simple you might find

00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,380
this useful release it's where you're

00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,820
not really looking to start some major

00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,680
project you're not trying to write the

00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:29,280
next Django you've just got a thing that

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,810
you've done and no harm to me if I put

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,780
it out there and you maybe use it as

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,420
well you might find it useful who knows

00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:38,550
this is essentially the spirit behind

00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:40,500
the scientific method generally in the

00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:43,020
movie awakenings it's based on a book by

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,209
all the sax stars Robin Williams the

00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,830
main protagonist is a researcher he's

00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:49,380
been quizzed about his PhD where he

00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:51,480
which he describes as an epic project I

00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,730
was to extract one deck a gram of Milan

00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,170
from four tons of Earth words I was the

00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,270
only one who believed in it everyone

00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,820
else said it couldn't be done and his

00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,620
Inquisitor says it can't and the

00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:06,120
responses yeah I know that now I proved

00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,950
it so you might not even talking about a

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,300
successful project here it might just be

00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,850
something where you're tinkering to see

00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,410
if something might be viable or it might

00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,640
be something you've used in production

00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,230
but you don't have any particular

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,280
commercial interest in it but it's no

00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,900
you might as well put it out there so

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,950
someone else can look at it you're not

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,450
trying to start something you're just

00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,710
trying to help the community by letting

00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,240
the world know that you've done

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,310
something that might be used as a

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,580
starting point or an inspiration or as

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,690
proof that it just doesn't work the

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,340
other approach is where you're throwing

00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,660
things out there you actually want

00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,780
people to use the project you're

00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,460
planning to contribute

00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,230
continue working on it you'd like other

00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,300
people to use it too and in an ideal

00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:42,690
world you get contributions from other

00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,980
people that can improve your code base

00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:46,540
this is where you think you've got the

00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,010
next jangle in your hands and it doesn't

00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,020
necessarily have to be some of the size

00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,280
of Django it can be a small project but

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:55,510
you're putting your flag in the dirt to

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,250
say I'm the go to library for X but it's

00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:59,410
incredibly important to know which type

00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,150
of project you'll release it and if

00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,530
you're just throwing it out there you're

00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:05,110
not making a commitment to maintain it

00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,820
that's fine but if you're asking people

00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,770
to an intellectually invest in your tool

00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,750
your framework your library then you've

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,760
also just signed up to pay attention to

00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,919
that community and to be clear I'm not

00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,810
saying you're therefore obliged to fix

00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:18,280
their bugs for free I'm saying that

00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,690
you're putting something out there and

00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,610
representing it as something that you

00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,530
intend others to use you've just started

00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,650
a dialogue and you started to set

00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:28,060
expectations so the key thing here is

00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,919
you need to know what you're trying to

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,060
do and then communicate what you're

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,850
trying to do communicate your intentions

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,440
if you find the project and it says in

00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,540
banner text in the readme this is an

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,610
experiment that I've abandoned then you

00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,710
know what to expect if it says nothing

00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,900
the default interpretation is almost

00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:47,050
always going to be this person wants me

00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:49,600
to use their project so consider

00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:51,669
yourself as a user if your project

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,620
website says retro and cab you later is

00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:55,510
the best framework for prefab relating

00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,400
your differential girdle spring and

00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:00,060
you've got a differential girdle spring

00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,110
that needs prefab relating three dozen

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,430
you're going to be excited you've just

00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,810
found a project that solves your problem

00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,580
and when it turns out that I only prefab

00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:08,530
you lates non-reversible don't know

00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,090
differential good experience you're

00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,680
going to la de bug or try to submit app

00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,330
apps or try to engage with the project

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,560
in some way after all why would this

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,930
person to put it out there if they

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,610
didn't want to improve and if the

00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,710
project maintainer then doesn't respond

00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,840
or respond slowly response ambiguously

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,220
or worse respond angrily you're just

00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,930
going to get annoyed at the project and

00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,750
the project maintainer has then just

00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,190
lost a potential community member

00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:32,289
although there's an interesting aside we

00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,820
would all as human beings do a lot

00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:35,200
better to get in the mental habit of

00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,300
thinking or thinking of open source

00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,880
projects as you might find this useful

00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,909
by default rather than everybody please

00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,440
use this quite a fault assume by default

00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:45,370
you're going to get no support unless

00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,810
the project says

00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,100
you will don't assume you're going to

00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:52,389
get support and then be surprised when

00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:54,400
you don't and don't forget a project can

00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:55,630
change over time a couple of years ago I

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,580
was maintaining a library called

00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:59,199
cassowary which is an implementation of

00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,330
a well-known constraint solving

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,940
algorithm I published it because I was

00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:06,070
at that time using it as part of Togo we

00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,750
did toolkit I've recently changed toga

00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,070
to use a CSS basic approach so I no

00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,350
longer need the capability that

00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,729
cassowary implements but to make sure

00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,199
there's been a confusion over the status

00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:16,720
of the project the project website and

00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:18,340
is now listed under attic section of the

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,500
beware homepage and at the top of the

00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,060
readme it says the same I'll still merge

00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,530
pull requests and if I wants to take

00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,180
over the project then more than welcome

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:29,500
but I've made it clear that it's not the

00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:30,699
focus of my attention anymore so you

00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,870
know what you're trying to achieve with

00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:35,560
your project and you've communicated

00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:36,699
that effectively what comes next I would

00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,289
suggest the next thing you need to look

00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:40,570
at is your projects out of box

00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:42,370
experience the experience that a new

00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:44,440
user has when they discover your project

00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,330
for the first time imagine someone knows

00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,020
nothing about your project your code

00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:51,430
they visit the website what do they find

00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,139
Django's out of box experience is a good

00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,639
example here if you visit Django's

00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,349
website you're invited to do a tutorial

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,729
and there's a sorry there's a brief

00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:59,380
description of what Django is and which

00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:01,389
invites you to do a tutorial you follow

00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,010
the steps and about the only decision

00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:05,020
you really need to make along the way is

00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:06,760
what database you have to use and even

00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,710
then it strongly says just use sequel

00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,750
like for your first pass your path the

00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:12,700
getting started is clear you don't have

00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,770
to make a whole lot of decisions and you

00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,660
should the end of a four-page tutorial

00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:19,330
get a running project with a decent feel

00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:21,669
of what the project can do if users

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,710
can't find your tutorial or they can

00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:25,210
find it and it doesn't work they're

00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:27,220
going to assume that either the problem

00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:29,590
is in them or that they're stupid and

00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:33,459
either result isn't good for your

00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:35,409
project Kathy Sierra is a tech writer

00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:37,330
and blogger she wrote a blog post

00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:39,940
entitled attenuation and the suck

00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:41,830
threshold in which he talks about user

00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,599
engagement on new projects and what she

00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:45,700
says is when you're introducing a person

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,520
to a new project you need to make their

00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,950
time from zero to kick us as low as

00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,080
possible a new user has to go from I

00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,940
know nothing about this

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,190
project but the name to kicking a

00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,380
real-world practical and personally

00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,950
applicable goal as quickly as possible

00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:03,480
if that time is low the you user gets an

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:07,320
immediate sense of progress and a little

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,820
endorphin rush in their brain and they

00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,020
get over that such pressure they feel

00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,090
like they can do anything and they're

00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,580
more likely to persist and go to the

00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:16,890
next step even if those little steps are

00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:19,410
a little bit harder and every time that

00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:23,160
they kick a little bit more us they get

00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:25,440
a little bit closer to doing more and

00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,210
more advanced things but more likely

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,260
they are to give up the more likely they

00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,030
are to develop an S at negative

00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,970
impression of your tall or taller

00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:34,680
product every decision a new user has to

00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,940
make during the tutorial process is one

00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,890
more thing that could make it harder to

00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,350
get over that sub threshold every dead

00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,640
end they go to your documentation tree

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,440
makes them feel that little bit more

00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,270
stupid and they're not stupid you just

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,160
failed to communicate effectively your

00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:51,120
most important audience new users

00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,530
marketing people like to talk about

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,940
conversion funnels because they're going

00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:55,680
up stand it helps to think about your

00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,140
open source project in a similar sort of

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,840
way the use of an open source project

00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,880
doesn't stop we've becoming a user if

00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,010
you're going to have a vibrant

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,600
long-running project you want people to

00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,190
work their way all the way down the

00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,650
conversion funnel they come to you as

00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,940
potential users the entire population of

00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,440
the planners effectively a potential

00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,210
user some of those people will do the

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,070
tutorial and become new users of your

00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,540
project some of those people will

00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,980
continue to use the project find some

00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,050
real practical use for it and become

00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,340
actual users some of those users will

00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,720
hang around and become long-term

00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,770
community members some of those

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,270
community members what we eventually

00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,560
become contributors some of those

00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,000
contributors will join your core team

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,100
and eventually some of them will move

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,860
into leadership positions unless you are

00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,750
working on that entire funnel and that

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:41,250
entire conversion funnel your project

00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:43,790
will at some point stall that means you

00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,720
also don't just need a first time user

00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:47,580
tutorial you need a first time

00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,380
contributor tutorial you need to

00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,480
document your processes and the

00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,010
potential contributors can move their

00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,040
way down this process or down this

00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:57,750
funnel django does this fairly well the

00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,340
contribution process is very well

00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,370
documented and that the sprints is

00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,260
always a

00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,520
would someone know someone who's leading

00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,410
the process to say hey let's get

00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,700
involved it's something that I think

00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,950
I've been able to do quite well with

00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,420
beware so far with openoffice of

00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:12,130
mentoring and with the challenge cleans

00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:15,760
trying to encourage people to get

00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:17,740
involved it's not just about getting

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,990
users though you have to go to retain

00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,760
those users over time which means you

00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:23,350
have to think about what users need in

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,970
the long term such as the role that

00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,820
backwards compatibility plays in

00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:29,380
long-term project viability django has a

00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,940
backwards compatibility possible policy

00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,890
which guarantees that code running today

00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,900
will continue to run for quite some time

00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:36,580
in the future at least two release

00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,770
cycles and then there's also a long-term

00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:41,020
support release to go even longer other

00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:43,000
projects deliberately break break

00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,470
compatibility between point releases how

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,300
much does this matter it depends

00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:49,360
entirely upon your perspective and your

00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,740
intended audience if you spend your life

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,420
working on short-term contracts

00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:54,160
delivering sites with no long-term

00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,630
maintenance overhead say a promotional

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,550
website for an advantage or site

00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:59,650
supporting an advertising campaign you

00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,660
don't have long-term problems you finish

00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:03,490
a job you move on to the next one every

00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,990
time you start your free to try

00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,790
something new experiment a little bit

00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,380
replace something that didn't work well

00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:10,720
last time you're looking at the world

00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:14,050
through glasses which think of six

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,850
months as a long time however if you're

00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,380
engaged in a multi-year project you

00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,930
really care about long-term

00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,450
maintainability in a former life I was

00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:24,190
involved with the Joint Strike Fighter

00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:25,839
project it's a multi-billion dollar

00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:27,610
project through develop the next

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,230
generation fighter for the US Air Force

00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:32,350
and at the point of conception of the

00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:34,270
project in 1990 they didn't anticipate

00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:36,459
delivering a working airframe for 20

00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:39,850
years and at this point it's six years

00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:42,459
late and before it became operational

00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,320
they were planning on doing two full

00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:47,770
rebuilds of the avionics subsystems if

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,900
you're in this space you really care

00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:51,610
about long-term maintenance you don't

00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,650
want the world shifting underneath you

00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:55,900
every three months you can't use a

00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:58,029
product that doesn't have a ten-year

00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:00,160
support plan in place six months is a

00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:03,880
rounding error it's a series of meetings

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:06,310
with your supervisor another example of

00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,170
this is quote from us a sec Lasky from

00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,430
pinboard a rule of thumb that has worked

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,810
for me is that if unexcited

00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:15,160
play around with something it probably

00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:16,930
doesn't belong in production and I agree

00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,490
with you excitement is not property i

00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,890
aspire to when I think about by

00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:23,320
production servers boring is a virtue in

00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:24,430
production boring is predictable Orion

00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,570
doesn't wake you up at three o'clock in

00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:29,200
the morning every trash path your

00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:30,580
database now to be clear I'm not saying

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,010
one approach is right and one approach

00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,380
is wrong I'm saying that the properties

00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:37,510
you value in a project depends on your

00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,220
perspective and that perspective is

00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:43,089
something you need to communicate so

00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:45,070
that users know what to expect you also

00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:46,300
can't just focus on your own project in

00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,399
your needs you need to look at the

00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,459
broader community the ecosystem in which

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,839
your tool sets to explain this I'd like

00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:55,750
to take a quick tangent here and talk

00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:58,300
about tractors one of the project

00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,350
founders and of January is a man named

00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,520
jacquard Jagger capital moss

00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,649
unfortunately not here this weekend oh

00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,589
this week Jacob is a man of many times

00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:07,570
but here's until recently one of his

00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:10,029
biggest passions was his farm and he's

00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:11,950
trapped in Maine think about one of the

00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:13,330
interesting features of farm tractors

00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:17,290
not something we usually think of as a

00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:18,220
bastion of high tech but they is a

00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,959
feature of something called a

00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,670
three-point linkage the three-point

00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:25,029
linkage is a system that has been used

00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:26,589
on tractors for almost 90 years it was

00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:28,990
originally developed in the 1920s by

00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:30,190
Ferguson and there was adopted by pretty

00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:32,380
much every farming equipment

00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:34,120
manufacturer and tractor manufacturer it

00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,010
was eventually encoded as an iso

00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,870
standard in the 1980s but that was

00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:40,029
really just codifying what everyone

00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:41,290
already agreed on well the three-point

00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:43,180
linkage does if you're quite a very

00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,770
simple interface that enables plows see

00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,560
there's harvesters whatever else to be

00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:48,670
attached to any tractor you want and

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,000
giving the backwards compatibility point

00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:54,070
it's been consistent for 90 years a farm

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,570
tool built in the 1930s will connect to

00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:59,980
a tractor that came off the assembly

00:14:55,570 --> 00:15:01,450
line last week and vice versa what the

00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,070
three-point linkage does is change a

00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,810
tractor from being a single Percival

00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:07,000
purpose tool into being part of an

00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:09,399
ecosystem of tools when you buy a tool

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,770
you get a tool and you can buy it fine

00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:13,779
set of tools the real talk outcomes

00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:16,180
where the tools are able to work

00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:18,459
together when you buy into an ecosystem

00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,080
you get infinitely more value because

00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,730
you're not just buying a tool

00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,470
you're buying into all the possible ways

00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:26,770
that tool can be combined everything

00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:28,810
else in the ecosystem no tool lives in a

00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,670
world of its own especially in computing

00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:32,140
so pay attention to the rest of your

00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:34,690
community and work with that community

00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:37,810
and their expectations this is really

00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:39,610
just Metcalfe's law writ large Jan go by

00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,170
itself is not that exciting it can do

00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,850
stuff short but it's limited what's

00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:44,860
exciting is the ecosystem of stuff

00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:46,540
around it every time someone writes a

00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,880
plug-in or a library that's part of the

00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:50,410
Django ecosystem every other package

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,450
gains some value because it's compatible

00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:54,550
with all the other bits there's

00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:56,860
something like 4,000 packages on pi PI

00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:58,540
that tagged as being Django related data

00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,860
are compatible now even if you consider

00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,440
sturgeons law that ninety percent of

00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:07,630
everything is crap that's still 400

00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:09,490
useful packages this is something that

00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:11,470
Django does quite well at a technical

00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:13,720
level but it doesn't do it well at a

00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,810
social level Django's architecture

00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,840
encourages people to build distributive

00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:21,280
acts to specific tasks as a project on

00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,380
django doesn't do a good job at

00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,820
highlighting those apps in the community

00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,990
as a whole and the community that the

00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,760
Italians been added in the community

00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:29,830
there are sites like Jane Doe packages

00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,500
but Django's core infrastructure doesn't

00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:33,730
ever reference those sorts of tools that

00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,680
limits usefulness of Django packages

00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:39,040
because it's not a hub that everyone who

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,910
comes to the project knows about so if

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,680
you'll notice if you're paying attention

00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:44,020
what you'll notice is a recurring theme

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,180
here the importance of communication and

00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:48,340
it's not just a matter of what you're

00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:51,190
saying it's how you say how the message

00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,990
gets out there Django wasn't the only

00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,970
Python web framework that was launched

00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:57,040
around ten years ago about that time

00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:59,590
there was also cherry pie turbo gears

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,890
repos bfg quick show of hands ten years

00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:04,570
later who's heard of those three yeah so

00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:07,630
we've got maybe a quarter of the

00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:09,850
audience okay so turbo gears and repost

00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:12,339
pH bfg kind of merged and reformed and

00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:14,320
ended I was pyramid ones that rebranding

00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:16,030
necessary well if turbo gears had been

00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,410
successful it wouldn't have needed to

00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:20,050
move anything it would have been the

00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:22,780
Django of today so why did Django for

00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:24,160
one of a much better word win was it

00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,660
because Jane Doe is technically superior

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,370
well I've had more than one discussion

00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,170
with pirate pyramid advocates who have

00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:31,090
told me a great length that gender

00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:32,500
doesn't wrong unless

00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,630
say they're white they've certainly got

00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,070
some valid technical arguments in it if

00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:39,760
that's the case how did a technically

00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:41,590
inferior product win Django I would

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,419
argue one because the publicly

00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:45,760
communicated narrative about Django was

00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:47,409
a lot more coherent it resonated better

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,909
with the audience that reached Django's

00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:52,000
tutorial man the onboarding experience

00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:53,770
was was a lot better jus documentation

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,900
and community making ongoing experience

00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,429
was better these fact that's messaging

00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,799
on board a user experience these are

00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:01,630
sales and marketing factors Django one

00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:03,640
because of better sales at marketing I'm

00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:05,830
not saying we had better banner ads at

00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,980
141 of a better word because it was

00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:10,539
better at getting the message out I've

00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,039
also had this from the other side eight

00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:13,690
years ago I started a project called

00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:15,309
Jango evolution it was a migration

00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:18,789
framework for Django and at the very

00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:20,200
first Django con nine years ago I sorry

00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:21,850
eight years ago I participated in a

00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,860
panel discussion with Simon willison and

00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,450
Andrew Godwin who are the three

00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:27,429
maintained is it the three migration

00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:29,350
frameworks at the time and I think at

00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:31,330
the time the other two actually weren't

00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:32,890
publicly available they were they were

00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:36,059
like released as a result of being on

00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:38,799
the panel that wasn't like that right

00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:40,720
and of course as we all know Jane you

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:47,620
evolution was eventually moved in Django

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:49,760
core as part of the 1.7 release no wait

00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,800
that was self yeah

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:55,010
and so I was first to market what

00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:57,290
happened I got tagged very early on with

00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:59,300
the label that evolution was magic and I

00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:00,680
never managed to shape that I never

00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:03,080
managed to reshape that narrative I

00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:06,380
completely failed at sales and marketing

00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:08,060
and the rest is history so don't just

00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,260
write off sales and marketing don't get

00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,210
me wrong many salespeople and their

00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,530
tactics make my skin crawl but that

00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,940
doesn't mean that sales and marketing

00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:16,070
isn't important it's just the opposite

00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,840
it's incredibly important but it does

00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:20,150
mean it makes it be done well and

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,440
marketing that works well for you may

00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:23,810
not be the marketing that works for your

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,160
target audience and it's not just about

00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:27,380
open source either the same is true for

00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:30,710
any commercial endeavor buy me a whiskey

00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,450
and ask me how I know ok so what works

00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:34,580
and what doesn't what I'm going to do

00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:37,100
now is what is scientifically turned a

00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:40,300
wild ass guess or to use the proper

00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:42,620
Django Nanak lecture a wild aspects I

00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:45,500
don't have any hard data to back this up

00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:46,640
this is entirely anecdotal I have no

00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,140
reason to believe that I'm right I've

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,460
been involved with successful projects

00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,080
that doesn't mean the projects that I'm

00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,370
involved in are successful because of

00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,900
these things I just think these are

00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:57,770
probably the causes and there are almost

00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:59,810
certainly factors that I've missed ok so

00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:01,190
why was Django successful what was in

00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:03,500
the right place at the right time we

00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:05,330
were in a world where we'd be living

00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,920
with great big java web frameworks and

00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:08,690
Django came in and was able to show you

00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,910
how you could build a blog in 10 minutes

00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,400
it was a breath of fresh air with a new

00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:14,930
dynamic language and the the existing

00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,760
set of tools and whatnot they're

00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:18,860
available but very very heavy weight it

00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,300
had extremely good documentation from

00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,280
day one day one you landed on the

00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,080
project page and there was pages and

00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,030
pages and a fantastic tutorial that

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,400
walked away through my first experience

00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:30,160
of contributing to django was basically

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,850
coming in finding the project and

00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,070
discovering that couldn't do one little

00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,210
odd thing and then because the

00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,350
documentation was so good about

00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,880
explaining what it should have done

00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:39,590
combined with the fact that python is a

00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,780
really easy language to sort of read

00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:43,610
what was going on contributing a major

00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,290
patch and basically within a month i was

00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:47,510
a member of the core team now okay this

00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:51,320
is like 11 years ago so there was a lot

00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:53,000
more momentum but the fact that that was

00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,370
able to happen the fact that that that

00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,720
path that onboarding path was so easy is

00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:59,150
part of the reason why python was

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,490
generally successful it also got set up

00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,080
very very early as a very

00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:04,840
community I don't know this was an

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,120
explicit decision but Jacob and Adrienne

00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:10,000
were very very aggressive about clamping

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,590
down or anybody who was rude on mailing

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,510
lists and as a result the mainland is

00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,610
generally speaking stayed very very

00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:16,870
polite it made it a very welcoming

00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:19,720
community in a great place to hang

00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:21,070
around Jane revolution the exact

00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,900
opposite it was in the right place

00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,570
within the right time but did badly

00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,740
communicated the message cricket is

00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:28,510
another project I've been involved with

00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,220
it's a graphical test run it was a very

00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,660
controversial idea and so I didn't

00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,490
really managed to convince people with

00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,110
the idea it had some autograph achill

00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:36,790
choices it was using typical TK and then

00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:38,800
I didn't follow up because when I found

00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:40,510
out the limitations of tickle TK or that

00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,500
I was starting against I kind of haven't

00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:45,100
gone back and really refresh that

00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,360
project beware on the other hand is one

00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,280
that I'm particularly proud of its I

00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,809
founded the project and it's so it's

00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,370
really kind of been the focus of all the

00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:55,030
things that I've observed over the years

00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:56,710
so in my opinion it's a combination of

00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:59,530
everything that I currently see to be

00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:01,809
the how you how you are successful as an

00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:03,820
open source project first off it's an

00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:05,559
umbrella project beware is one name

00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,360
wrapping around a whole lot of smaller

00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:09,460
projects that means I'm not trying to

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,050
build a brand around each one of my

00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:12,820
little libraries I'm building one big

00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,809
brand beware and then directing people

00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,520
and following people to all the

00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:16,929
individual parts that has the additional

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,250
benefit that's a lot easier to

00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:19,600
understand the whole picture because you

00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,280
can understand what this does and what

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,450
this does and what this does and then

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,559
you can see the path of how they will

00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,890
connect it rather than trying to

00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:28,750
understand the entire blob at once I've

00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:31,750
been very very careful to be

00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:33,460
aggressively nice this is something that

00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:36,309
I've kind of learned from the olders in

00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:38,620
Django girls they are in their public

00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:41,170
emails public communications absurdly

00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:44,080
friendly and nice and gregarious and

00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:47,170
bubbly and initially that felt a little

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,669
odd but when you do that it actually one

00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,139
makes you so feel really

00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:51,429
kind of good because you're not focusing

00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:53,139
on the negative you're focusing on the

00:22:51,429 --> 00:22:55,320
positive all the time and people like to

00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:57,429
feel positive who would have thought

00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,619
I've been very aggressive about average

00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:01,179
going aggressively after you maintain

00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:02,859
it's safe you want to contribute to be

00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:04,899
where I am there I will help you become

00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:06,070
an become a beware contributor I will be

00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:07,359
your mentor I will help you get over

00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:09,909
that line I will help you get your

00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:11,230
commitment your commitment so focusing

00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:12,759
on that onboarding process what does it

00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:14,049
look like to become a new user what does

00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:15,999
it look like to become a new contributor

00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:17,799
and a rewarding those contributors with

00:23:15,999 --> 00:23:19,389
things like challenge cleans and every

00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:21,279
time that something does happen that is

00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:22,869
a notable event new person joins the

00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:24,820
project new person does something that's

00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:26,769
complex tweeting about it making a bit

00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,749
of noise on social media and

00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:30,609
acknowledging all contributions not just

00:23:28,749 --> 00:23:32,049
code things that have done socially

00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:33,549
think we'll have written documentation

00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:35,379
people have contributed to the broader

00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:37,739
ecosystem people who have contributed to

00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:39,999
other projects that have helped be where

00:23:37,739 --> 00:23:41,950
I've been very vocal on social media

00:23:39,999 --> 00:23:43,629
getting out there regularly maintained

00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:45,070
Ian cadence of saying things about your

00:23:43,629 --> 00:23:46,389
project getting people saying hey look

00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:48,249
this things out there this thing's being

00:23:46,389 --> 00:23:50,049
realistic there this project exists just

00:23:48,249 --> 00:23:51,909
knowing that it exists is part of the

00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:53,080
whole exercise with sales and marketing

00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:55,929
because you've got to be in the front of

00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,399
people's mind all the time I've also had

00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:59,919
a very balanced a 10 tabs you to

00:23:57,399 --> 00:24:02,470
accepting Patchett's in the days of

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,690
django way up we particularly my own

00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:06,369
early days of django if a patch was a

00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,539
perfect I wouldn't merge it and I'd

00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:11,950
probably go on say I take that passion

00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:13,749
off of of things for you in beware I've

00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,399
kind of relaxed out of it I've fallen

00:24:13,749 --> 00:24:17,320
back onto the world where the test suite

00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:19,899
tells you whether it works you look at

00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,850
the code is the code better for being in

00:24:19,899 --> 00:24:23,799
rather than out as one more test passed

00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:25,389
as one more edge condition go you can

00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:28,029
always clean up the architectural stuff

00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:29,559
later and that means that you get more

00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:32,639
people in and you don't get people tied

00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:34,960
up in really really convoluted you know

00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:36,669
project acceptance procedures and tied

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,019
to that we're also automating a lot of

00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:39,999
these project acceptance procedures

00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:43,090
automating continuous integration tests

00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:44,200
automating linting checks I've also been

00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,450
very cared intercept community

00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,580
expectations around community culture

00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:50,200
that money is a part of this story we

00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:52,150
are not expecting this to be

00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,160
a volunteer we want money to be pirates

00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:55,780
we want a healthy lifestyle a healthy

00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,090
mental attitude to the project to be

00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,500
part of the project so that later on

00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:01,000
down the line when we do get to the

00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,830
point where maybe there are commercial

00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,420
organizations involved we're not tied

00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,890
with its internal schism of oh no it

00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,840
must be free or no it must be paid

00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:09,190
setting right now it's going to be paid

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,340
because that's the way you make things

00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:13,690
sustainable all of this really comes

00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:16,390
down to the old quote from Pascal

00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:17,920
fortune favors the prepared mind if you

00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:20,410
want your project to be successful you

00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,260
need to plan for that success it takes

00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:25,390
years to become an overnight success

00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,950
I've benefited from being part of a

00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,720
larger successful project like Django

00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:30,370
I'm on the very early stages of what I

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,350
hope will be a similar journey to be

00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:33,970
with the things I've spoken about today

00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,980
both in this talk and the one I go this

00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:38,370
morning represent the sum total of the

00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:40,690
knowledge I have about being successful

00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:42,520
you'll notice though how little of it

00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:44,950
has to do with technical aspects of the

00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:47,680
code open source projects are ultimately

00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:49,330
about communities communities of people

00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,430
with aligned interests acting

00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:53,470
collectively this means that issues of

00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:55,510
communication collaboration social

00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:57,040
justice inclusivity these are

00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:59,560
intertwined with technical aspects

00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:02,980
because without the soft aspects the

00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:04,900
hard aspects can't be done this is

00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:07,210
something that's taken us collectively

00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:09,820
as an engineer has an engineering group

00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:10,840
a long time to learn and it's taking

00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,010
something where it's at something where

00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,480
it's taking a long time to establish

00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:15,850
best practice and we've still got plenty

00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,740
to learn the key is to pay attention to

00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:19,930
it keep your eye ears open and your

00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,550
mouth shut and look for ways to improve

00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:24,580
the social aspects around your project

00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:26,820
and improve your communication thank you

00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,820
all very much

00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:39,629
we have the room for three more minutes

00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:41,279
so you can either ask the world's

00:26:39,629 --> 00:26:43,259
shortest question or you can take your

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,029
questions outside afterward I also say

00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:46,679
the challenge coins anybody i'm here

00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:47,879
till the end of the week to sprint so if

00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:49,169
anybody does want to become a call to

00:26:47,879 --> 00:26:50,220
dribble i can guarantee you will have

00:26:49,169 --> 00:26:52,409
one of these by the end of a 30 day

00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:54,749
spring probably even a lot sooner than

00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:57,629
that we gave that 48 of them had parked

00:26:54,749 --> 00:26:59,940
on us so i'm also actively looking for

00:26:57,629 --> 00:27:02,909
benefactors and sponsors to help me

00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:04,320
continue beware so if you or your

00:27:02,909 --> 00:27:08,429
company might be to be pitching in or

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,840
hiring me come talk to me and yeah i'm

00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:15,450
also going to be doing at intense Lance
