	DjangoCon US 2016 - Design for Non-Designers by Tracy Osborn

Not everyone can hire a professional designer for their websites and web apps, but we all still want our interfaces to be easy to use and attractive. However, if you want to learn a bit of design, design books jump straight into concepts like "the golden ratio" and teach proper typographic terms which, to be frank, aren't needed if you're just looking to improve your website's look and feel.

This talk will cover the top quick ways to improve your website, covering both user experience as well as visual design. Quick hits, easy to understand and utilize principles that anyone can use to improve their design skills. Perhaps you too can become the next designer+developer unicorn!

Outline Intro (5%): * Who am I? * Why is good design important? Overview of design terms (only the basics) (20%): * Definitions and overview of UI, UX, and visual design. * Overview of conversion, goals, and click-through rates. * What's most important when you're designing? Easy-to-understand design principles (40%): * Clutter is our #1 enemy. How a grid, fonts, and color can affect how cluttered our design looks. * Faces and photos, and other shortcuts we can use to make beautiful designs Step-by-step of walkthrough of creating a website design (20%): * Collecting ideas. * Sketching your ideas efficiently. * Tools to mock up your ideas. * Resources to help you build your idea. How improve your design eye and become a better designer (10%). Resources to learn more (5%).

Attendees should have the know-how to quickly improve the design of their websites immediately as well as knowledge of resources to improve their design eye.

like you said I'm Tracy I'm lime daring

00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,710
on Twitter common mistake people say

00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,310
lime darling I'm not lying darling I'm

00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:29,480
like very happens every time so I put it

00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:31,489
in front so first off a little bit about

00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,969
me and my journey um some of you might

00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:36,770
know me I spoken at previous dingo cons

00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:39,140
about the process of teaching myself how

00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:41,690
to code and this is the sites that I ran

00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:45,260
I was running for about seven years and

00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:48,110
long story short I was a designer with

00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,060
no programming experience and wanted to

00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,680
build a startup I ended up learning a

00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,420
little bit of Django launched this

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,350
little website this little website

00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:59,360
suddenly started coming like larger not

00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,430
a Cecily big big but larger than before

00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,720
I turn into a startup and it's been one

00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,519
of the most fulfilling things I've ever

00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,549
done in my life like learning how to

00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:10,189
code learning how to to do Django it's

00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:11,299
been wonderful over that process of

00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:14,270
teaching myself how to code while

00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:16,490
building this website I started thinking

00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,810
like why like I'll figure something out

00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,490
and I'll be like why was it taught that

00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,460
way when it could have been taught this

00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:24,049
way especially as a designer that's

00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,259
where the book series come about came

00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:29,240
about so I built hello web app to teach

00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:34,249
programming or what about developmental

00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:36,799
ease to non programmers designers like

00:01:34,249 --> 00:01:39,020
my books a lot I designed them I

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,310
self-published them the dingo community

00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,649
in the Python community has been so

00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,600
wonderful my second book last year's

00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:46,039
junior con I was a fundraising

00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,679
Kickstarter for my second book

00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:50,779
everyone's an awesome so thank you

00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:54,799
everyone and Django for supporting me in

00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:57,109
this journey but as I've been working on

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,329
these books teaching programming say to

00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:00,700
designers I've also been thinking about

00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:03,049
ways that I could teach design

00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:06,649
programmers because that's my background

00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:07,700
I have an 80 degree in art and I did

00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:09,349
graphic design and I worked so I

00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,750
designed her for a long time and the

00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:14,120
same thing I started looking at program

00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:16,459
excuse me tutorials teaching design

00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,810
through programmers and same thing as

00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:19,970
before I was like well I was a taught

00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,349
why is it taught this way when I clearly

00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:24,239
think it should be taught a different

00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:25,890
way why how do we how can I teach

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,030
designed to people who have a

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,129
programming background makes course

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:32,489
since and then say hey some of these

00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:34,409
other tutorials exist so by design I

00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:35,760
don't mean this is crazy design the

00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:37,230
world of design just like programming

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,420
the wrong design there are so many

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:42,170
different fields within design UI design

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:46,769
you access eye and visual design I

00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:50,370
simply mean design in that you helping

00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:53,099
you make an interface that works well is

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,599
at some point in your career as a you

00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:56,519
know when you're programming or building

00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,590
open-source projects you'll probably at

00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,439
some point need to create something that

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:06,510
other people use you know at homepage

00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:08,099
for your open source project so I want

00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,019
to be here to help you feel more

00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:12,120
comfortable jumping in and doing design

00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,950
I know a lot of people say oh I need to

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,930
go find a designer help me if I project

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,129
but that was like me when I was learning

00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,930
how to program I was like oh I need to

00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:21,359
go find a co-founder for my project I

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,849
want to help you just be more

00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:25,469
comfortable work on design your own and

00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:26,549
some of the things that really give me

00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:28,680
pet peeves or not going to talk about

00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:31,709
here in this talk not gonna talk to goal

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,549
the ratio that is I don't know why keeps

00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:36,690
showing up in beginner design Tharks not

00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,639
gonna talk about the pieces and parts of

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,470
typography I know there's a typography

00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,970
caught I think tomorrow and I'll be

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:46,949
awesome I'm gonna bypass that for now I

00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:51,720
just want to talk to you about creating

00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:53,220
better more effective designs so first

00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,530
and foremost let's just talk about the

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,909
visual stuff and the number one thing to

00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,680
remember if you're becoming a designer

00:03:56,909 --> 00:04:01,319
or excuse me not becoming a designer but

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,930
wanna do design is to simply cut down on

00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:08,220
clutter

00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:12,449
for example great example of the most

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:15,389
like crazy cluttery website the fastest

00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:17,909
way to a better design is to cut down on

00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:21,750
clutter so for example I built this

00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:24,270
little widget and you know it's okay and

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:27,030
we're going to make some design

00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:29,250
principles apply it to this widget and

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,110
see how things slowly improve this

00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,990
little widget I built and make it a

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,139
better design

00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:38,630
so first the grin you might already know

00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:41,270
about the grid because grids show up in

00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:43,130
things like bootstrap just think of the

00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:45,949
grid like adding a grade to something as

00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:48,289
simply lining things up because pixel

00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:50,120
differences are noticed like when

00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:51,410
something is like a little bit offset

00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,479
from something else

00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:57,080
those pixel differences can add to a

00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:58,699
sense of clutter so instead of thinking

00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,960
you're like working on a design project

00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:02,990
like oh my gosh I need to line

00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,849
everything up like I love shortcuts and

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,190
when I again pet peeves this when people

00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:11,509
say don't use bootstrap everyone's using

00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:13,070
bootstrap use bootstrap seriously like

00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:14,300
it has all these shortcuts oh it's gonna

00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,460
make your life so much easier because it

00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:19,490
has a grid system built in I love these

00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,259
shortcuts I love like trying to use

00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:24,800
things I used to extract all of my stuff

00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:28,630
use things that like bootstrap you uh

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:32,599
whose Drecker design make it better so

00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:35,569
to see lining things up in action add

00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:37,729
this a little widget and we just simply

00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:39,740
set up columns on the left and right

00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:42,349
side lining things up and you can

00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:47,509
already see that's looking a little bit

00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:49,699
cleaner it's a next up color again big

00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:51,349
overarching principles color principles

00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:53,150
keep your color is complimentary making

00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:56,000
them work kind of well each other get

00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:57,949
into a second what that means but a good

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,169
rule of thumb is to use mostly neutrals

00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:03,830
and use a bright color to help things

00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:08,389
stand out now there's so much to say

00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:10,340
about color and this article on Smashing

00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:11,840
Magazine is a particularly good one what

00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,610
simple why developers guide to color

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,370
like when I went to school is a whole

00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:18,020
quarter simply on color and it's kind of

00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,240
ridiculous there's so much to learn and

00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,840
understand in terms of like commentary

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,759
color is etc and so forth

00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:28,370
can't do that here but I love again

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,530
shortcuts so this is my favorite

00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,150
shortcut and I use this for everything I

00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,340
use this I use this for the color

00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,960
palette for my books for hello web I use

00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:39,620
this for the color palette for wedding

00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,419
lovely go to color lovers calm with it

00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,330
you I just moved to Canada so I'm like

00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:46,069
yeah use

00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:48,020
Kota loves a calm you can search for

00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:50,000
color palettes and other people have

00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,639
submitted and then people can vote on

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,789
them so if you search by you know top

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,580
most loves of all time you can find

00:06:55,789 --> 00:07:01,639
color palettes that are guaranteed to be

00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:03,199
complimentary to have a large range of

00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:05,750
colors you can scroll through here and

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,129
find something that you think might work

00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:11,180
with your project and try it out rather

00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:13,520
than say starting from scratch so back

00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,590
this little widget say when the color

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,270
lovers started pulling in some color

00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,979
palettes and applying it to this widget

00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,590
and just testing things out and

00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:23,150
sometimes they might not work if you try

00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:26,509
a bunch of different color palettes

00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:28,819
until something does but it's so much

00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:30,770
better than trying to like jump into

00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:32,060
some color program and like on that

00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:34,099
little palette and trying to pick and

00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:37,039
choose what works might as well just go

00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:39,110
to the place where you can find colors

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,189
that already work well together well

00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:45,830
with each other and use those instead

00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:47,360
and Oh quick note about this one and you

00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,520
don't don't feel like scared to like

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,169
update the color slightly the download

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,180
button on here can't really tell the

00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:54,409
screen but the darker red that the one

00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,210
that's in the comic palettes you can

00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:58,900
still play around but this gives you a

00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:03,050
really good shortcut

00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:06,319
next up fonts again principles

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,490
keep the number of fonts low it's just

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,229
in terms of clutter it is the more

00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,659
different types of fonts out there adds

00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:15,080
this feeling of clutter so two different

00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:17,419
fonts is a good rule of thumb try to use

00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,129
this place fonts very sparingly if I

00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:21,110
display fonts I mean everything that's

00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:25,069
in the back here some things I feel very

00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:27,979
90s those are also very cluttering so

00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:30,050
try to avoid using them and if you need

00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:32,089
to add more differentiation whatever

00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,099
you're designing you can add holding you

00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:36,289
can make things uppercase add italics

00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:39,260
you can use that tie differentiation

00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:44,930
rather than tapering in another another

00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:46,910
fun so again shortcuts love shortcuts so

00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:49,040
say google fonts i love google fonts

00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,810
they use it for everything as well but

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,250
if you go on there there's like 200

00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,170
something monsignor scrolling through

00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,020
and it's really overwhelming it's much

00:08:54,170 --> 00:09:00,010
easier to go to these websites like you

00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:02,200
website or type wolf which curate the

00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:04,570
best google fonts so instead of going

00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,010
through a list they'll say 200 fonts you

00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:08,860
can go into one of these sites and just

00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:10,330
have 20 to choose from and you're

00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:15,370
guaranteed to be working with a

00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:18,310
well-designed well of fun so back to the

00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:20,260
widget and you can update the font this

00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:22,870
is using a serif font and a sans serif

00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,520
font serif fonts just means a little

00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,020
widget on the end there's a type and

00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,770
probably you can learn more about that

00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:31,170
in a typography class I'd talk tomorrow

00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:34,210
essentially this is tutor for fonts and

00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:37,960
we did some differentiation the download

00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:40,180
button is all caps the input formats

00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,760
lower case we have some italics in there

00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:48,130
but it's looking a little bit cleaner

00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:51,310
and well put together last principle is

00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:54,760
white space white space is the ultimate

00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:57,700
clutter reducer I always laughed cousin

00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:00,280
hacker news we all know and love every

00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,480
mm three to six months there's always

00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,490
something that pops on Hacker News say

00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,740
hey everyone I'm a designer and I

00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,540
redesigned hacker news and every single

00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,750
time the main thing they do is just add

00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:12,400
whitespace no one thinks that well how

00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:15,130
can you use a super squashed I

00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,710
particularly like this one a little

00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:19,630
easier to read the white space isn't

00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:21,370
just like a person feeling like hey I

00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:24,310
want to make this all she's jumping

00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:27,160
ahead one more example as the New York

00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:30,700
Times redesign the New York Times as a

00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,960
as a newspaper has a lot information you

00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:35,710
can't just like blow it up with white

00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:38,590
space but this example left is before

00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:40,480
and right is after the right is a little

00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:42,340
bit less cluttered feeling and the main

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,620
one of the main things I did to make it

00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:47,110
feel less cluttered it simply opened up

00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,790
the columns in between the text a little

00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:52,810
bit more give it just a little bit more

00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:55,090
breathing room made a big impact the

00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,140
white space is kind of a huge trend

00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,850
right now which is a little funny

00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,410
because if you go on to these like top

00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,480
design website sites

00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:03,100
I took a random screen shot and every

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,250
single one of them has like acres of

00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,839
white space there's a huge trends and

00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:12,600
might go a little bit too far

00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:15,269
but not just a trend adding whitespace

00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:18,470
can also improve your conversion rate so

00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:22,680
in this example between these two tables

00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:23,760
the left table it just got moved a

00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,060
little bit farther down a little bit

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:30,029
more white space was added in between

00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:32,820
the two tables and by doing this they

00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:34,709
saw a 20% improvement engagement 5%

00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,050
boosting products added to cart and a

00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:40,769
33% and preventing customers continuing

00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:43,889
on through purchase so reducing clutter

00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:49,949
and using white space can affect your

00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:51,690
bottom line so back to a little bit we

00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:54,360
just let it breathe a little bit more

00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:56,070
and it's a space around the edges also

00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,510
normalize the spacing in between the

00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:00,660
blocks between the butt and the forum

00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:05,250
for content added some more line height

00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:08,190
between the paragraphs of contents so

00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:11,820
the headline and the content you can see

00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:14,449
units re looking pretty good at least a

00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:18,630
lot better than we were before

00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:20,490
so in terms of visual design the best

00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:22,079
thing you can do is just if simply think

00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:24,540
about how you can reduce clutter in your

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,889
design and if your reduce clutter by

00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,560
keeping the number of fonts and colors

00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:31,470
low adding whitespace and lining things

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,529
up like clean designs are really in

00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:39,089
right now and just aim for a clean

00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:40,440
design you'll get pretty far but you

00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:41,850
can't just talk about design without

00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,970
talking about user experience this is

00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:46,470
arguably more important not as arguably

00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,899
I leave it well hardly

00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:51,930
um how stuff works whatever you design

00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:54,630
how it works is better is more important

00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:56,100
than how it looks and whenever you're

00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:58,649
designing something just keep this in

00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,899
mind keep in keep in mind what's the

00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:03,630
most important action what do you want

00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:06,209
your users to do with your design and

00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:08,850
then focus on making that action easy to

00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:11,339
find and use I mean that's for example

00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,769
just a short little example that's the

00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:15,449
reason why widgets and forums won't not

00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:17,279
have a brighter color for the button

00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:21,449
does he want to have that button to be

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,440
easy easy to see use and click I use

00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:23,880
that on

00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,860
homepage for hello web app and that's

00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:30,300
why I get the books the most important

00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:33,000
part of my design is a bright green but

00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,250
also another websites you know this one

00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,290
has a pretty grey Drive background but

00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,940
it has a bright blue button but not just

00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:40,710
for landing pages you can see this in

00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,340
work and other page other websites like

00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,920
wealthfront

00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:46,080
engineering blog you can argue that they

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,030
have this blog specifically so they can

00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,010
bring in more engineers their company

00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:53,280
because they talk about engineering

00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:54,300
topics I think probably hope something

00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,190
comes over reads those interesting

00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,330
engineering topics and think hey this

00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:59,790
place looks like a good place to work

00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:02,460
and then bright green on the right they

00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:08,610
have a bright green blue hey do I work

00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:11,220
here button so you can say also again so

00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,970
much about user experience just keep

00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,160
that in mind

00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,660
I make sure that your goals are ease

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,730
into finding views make sure you have

00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:20,850
analytics make sure you're looking at

00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:22,880
how well your design is working if you

00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:26,460
launched a forum or a website or whatnot

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,500
pay attention to say like figure out a

00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,090
success metric if it's someone moving on

00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,520
to the next page we're submitting a form

00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:38,610
and see what you can do over time to

00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:40,320
make that better next up content this is

00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:42,510
a huge part about Web Design and a lot

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,060
of people forget about this I see a lot

00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:47,760
of people who launch their website and

00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:51,270
they want to tell the SA of their life

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,940
on the about page but the thing is they

00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:57,840
like large paragraphs of content or a

00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:59,310
sign of clutter no one like you there's

00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,190
people who read on the web but it's

00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:03,780
actually people are more likely to be

00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:05,790
scanning through your article or

00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:07,650
whatever your content looking for words

00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,850
and if they see giant paragraphs of

00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:12,000
content they're more likely to leave

00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:14,310
than read so when it comes right so in

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,970
general it comes at content less is more

00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:19,500
I try to cut down simplify break down

00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:21,780
your words I think it's like good

00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:25,920
principles like two to three sentences

00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:28,140
per paragraph big paragraphs are a sign

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,510
of clutter and if you can't simplify

00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:33,220
your content try to break into bullets

00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:35,890
this is a tactic I like to use a lot my

00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,390
content so on the left this paragraph of

00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:40,050
content is arguably kind of hard to use

00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:43,330
you can read it by going line by line

00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:45,370
but you can improve the readability but

00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:48,580
break Hansa bullets and then you have a

00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:50,770
visual point to skip between as someone

00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,840
again assuming someone's scanning and

00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:56,790
there probably are they can jump between

00:15:52,840 --> 00:16:00,070
they individual points in that paragraph

00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:02,800
but we can improve readability by adding

00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:04,870
some bolding so now we've like not only

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,300
broke it up into points we added bolding

00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:10,330
over around the most important parts of

00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:12,400
of those paragraphs so again that person

00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:13,960
who is scanning can read the bullet

00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,620
parts and then see whether they want to

00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:20,710
read further and then we also just

00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:23,050
talked about whitespace you can further

00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:27,960
improve readability by adding some white

00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:30,550
space all right so read the docs um I

00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,350
want to give a real-life example of

00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:34,300
something that I would test updating I

00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:36,250
love to look at designs and see you know

00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,450
if I was on this or Eric Holder came to

00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,510
me and said hey Tracey what do you think

00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:43,000
us homepage I don't think you will me

00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:44,800
knows I do this I quote it what would

00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,710
you test what would you try to change

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,550
and see if this increase conversion rate

00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:53,830
so I talked about making sure that you

00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:56,350
have an action and making sure that

00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:59,160
action is easy to find and use and this

00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:01,960
website is home page it's very gray I

00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,030
noticed that there is a hover state over

00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,490
whoo let's do this button that's bright

00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:08,949
cream so that is something that I would

00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:11,320
test I would test giving the eye some

00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:13,300
place to jump to just and that basically

00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,890
says like hey personal business homepage

00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,560
this is the most important part of this

00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:18,339
page now you could you know try making

00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,380
the signup button

00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:23,110
bright green or something but giving the

00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:24,579
eye like a path having those things easy

00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:26,829
to find and use

00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:30,550
if someone a path of what to like look

00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:34,000
at first let me just start talking about

00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:36,010
content and that content is this

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,730
homepage is very beautiful and that

00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:41,260
content looks very nice at it far away

00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,920
but I was wondering you know how many

00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,690
people actually do read this

00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,330
and I would also test breaking that up

00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:50,480
into bullets so this is arguably not as

00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:52,370
pretty as a that block of paragraph from

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,070
before but this is something that would

00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:56,510
test and see if taking the paragraph

00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:58,340
breaking the bullets making easier

00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,600
people to read those features that I

00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,970
want to read the box home page

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:07,640
I'd be something I'll try and see about

00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:09,110
updating but I don't want to stop at

00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,910
just content I want to talk a little bit

00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:12,260
about headlines as well headlines are

00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:14,810
very important and whatever you're

00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:16,880
designing say a blog posts or a home

00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:20,450
page for a landing page from what time a

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:23,780
thing of its hop in general it's better

00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:26,480
to talk benefits not details I'll give

00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:28,100
an example in that in a second just like

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,500
content though make sure your headlines

00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:32,540
are not too long and then try to use

00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,550
natural and friendly language talk like

00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:38,870
a human not robot that goes in the

00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:40,310
content in general so this is

00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:42,020
technically what my books are about my

00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:44,780
books are an introduction to building

00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:47,090
web apps and Python using web building

00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:48,440
web apps using Python and Django but

00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,180
this is boring I mean it's very

00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,060
descriptive it says exactly what my

00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:54,650
books are about but this makes more

00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:57,020
sense to a reader something coming to my

00:18:54,650 --> 00:19:00,770
website this gal some exactly what the

00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:02,810
benefit is if they read my books and

00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:04,160
again this is not just like personal

00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:06,740
feeling like hey this would be great to

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,020
do this headline changes the thing if

00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,600
someone sees first your website updating

00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:14,690
it to be more about benefits rather than

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,520
details can improve your conversion rate

00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:18,380
and this one is simply they set up the

00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:23,570
Ã¦ther headline and then improve their

00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:25,700
conversions by 52% so we're not done

00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:27,440
with the widget now you might notice

00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,180
that the headline is kind of boring the

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,090
content is kind of long for just a small

00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,950
little widget we can simplify it make it

00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,780
easier make it more human you know

00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:38,300
shorten the headline make it more about

00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,860
benefits shorten the content add some

00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:42,650
bolding an important part of that

00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:45,260
sentence I changed the input form so

00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:47,090
it's more human instead of saying email

00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:49,070
address says add your email here and

00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:50,690
then the button changes with just a

00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:52,160
simple download there's something again

00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,950
a little bit more like you're talking

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:58,140
someone say

00:19:52,950 --> 00:20:02,010
we free info so in this journey we have

00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:04,140
gone from here to here so you can see

00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:06,450
how small little changes through the

00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:10,100
principles can all work together to make

00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,100
something look nicer and easier to use

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,840
alright quick note about images and

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,310
imagery when I first gave this pocket

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,430
and had a section and this is one things

00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:23,370
that people usually ask me most about in

00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:26,070
general it's nice to add images to your

00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:29,010
website you can do so much with just

00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:31,410
text and say a screenshot and boxes and

00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:34,350
lines you don't necessarily have to have

00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:37,860
images and using a stock photo or

00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:40,980
someone just like people can pick that

00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:42,240
out immediately and generally pay

00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,130
attention to file size that's where also

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,810
images can screw it up and making sure

00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:48,720
you have retina quality images is also

00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:52,410
something I usually forget myself as I

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:56,550
have an old MacBook Air but you know

00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:59,970
like images can improve how delightful

00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:02,280
per se a website to be so in this

00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:04,890
example is just right and I really like

00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,650
there are little icons and it and those

00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:10,710
little icons they do help out and if you

00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:12,440
you know I want to not go say that you

00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:17,640
don't need images but they can help out

00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:18,990
and you know these ones are pretty

00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:23,010
simple and I'll get into where you can

00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:24,570
find them and it's just a second if you

00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:26,000
want like a big image in the background

00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:27,630
there's not a little bit of stock photo

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,690
unsplash.com

00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:33,180
is my favorite they say they upload

00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:35,160
beautiful kind of hipstery images but

00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,870
they're really beautiful and they say do

00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,000
whatever do with what you want with them

00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:42,300
and they're just beautiful really big

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,970
really awesome images photo pin is

00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:47,580
another resource I use for blocking that

00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:49,350
searches for Creative Commons images in

00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,900
Flickr and brings them up for you can

00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:53,970
use and then this is where I get yelled

00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:56,610
at by my designers if you want icons

00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:58,470
like the one on stripe and you are

00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:00,300
launching your first project you don't

00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:01,410
have a lot of budget I think it's

00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:05,580
totally okay to use something like

00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:08,850
Fiverr and get something cheap and fast

00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:10,950
now as a designer like once you have

00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:13,789
budget and you have the ability to do so

00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:17,039
a professionally designed logo image

00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:19,409
icons will be way better than ink you

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:23,429
can get on these these nights or you can

00:22:19,409 --> 00:22:26,610
pay very little to have to get images

00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:28,529
done really quickly for you but if

00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:30,080
you're just starting out I think this is

00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:33,179
a great start

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,369
and Meo again another example of how

00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:37,710
images can help out my friends of mine

00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:40,230
do app Canary and they're in Toronto and

00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:41,669
they worked with a local designer again

00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:44,039
pretty cheap to just create these little

00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:46,139
illustrations for their website and this

00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:48,330
is a sleeve work there again what local

00:22:46,139 --> 00:22:50,639
designer made something and they turned

00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:54,480
their website from just simply you know

00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:55,679
text images on the screenshot this adds

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,749
a little bit more delights their home

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,309
page so don't forget those local

00:22:57,749 --> 00:23:01,919
designers you can work with - they're

00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:07,889
probably not as expensive si a big

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:11,429
professional all right a little bit

00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:14,909
about philosophy if you are sitting down

00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:16,619
and working on a design project and you

00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:17,519
sweep your desk away and you pull out

00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:18,450
your piece of paper and your pen and

00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,720
you're just gonna start sketching

00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:24,299
something starting from scratch with

00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,799
nothing to inspire you nothing just just

00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:28,139
sitting down and trying to pull it up

00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:29,609
your brain is a lot like trying to

00:23:28,139 --> 00:23:32,100
program something without the use of

00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:34,019
Google or Stack Overflow this doesn't

00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,789
happen this is like it's giving yourself

00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:39,239
like a big shot that's fine like you're

00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:41,369
you're hindering yourself my books would

00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:42,269
not be I mean I'm not gonna say like

00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:43,679
they're the best design in the whole

00:23:42,269 --> 00:23:45,690
world I'm pretty proud of them though

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,149
and I could not have made the design I

00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:49,739
did without the inspiration of a book of

00:23:48,149 --> 00:23:51,149
Freud's books I was able to look at them

00:23:49,739 --> 00:23:54,269
and see what they did and get inspired

00:23:51,149 --> 00:23:57,590
and that influenced my design I didn't

00:23:54,269 --> 00:24:02,249
steal anything but being influenced is

00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:03,450
not only good for you it's encouraged so

00:24:02,249 --> 00:24:06,570
if you're working on a design project

00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:07,619
again building a form which etc there's

00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,929
a lot of websites out there that

00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:11,879
showcase good design that he'd go to and

00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:13,320
just look through and see you can find

00:24:11,879 --> 00:24:16,930
things that inspire you and give you

00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:19,280
ideas they're a site inspire

00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:20,600
style.css mania there's so many these

00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:24,260
websites out there that just liked a

00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:28,250
good design and whenever you find a

00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:30,260
design that you particularly like try to

00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:32,540
pick out the things are doing well so

00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:35,690
for example this slack homepage you know

00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:37,700
lots of white space the forum has a dark

00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:39,650
background the button is bright green if

00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,360
he's a clickable that has some bolding

00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:45,320
and a Content default does information

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,670
those important bits so when you find a

00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:49,130
design that's working well or even look

00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:51,500
at your competitors site picking out the

00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:54,290
things they think is working well is

00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:56,540
gonna help train your design eye and

00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:59,450
make it easier for you well you do

00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:00,800
better designs on your own and it's just

00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:04,070
kind of funny because it's totally a

00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:07,640
meme then design and then efan ski comes

00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:09,650
along and steals it there's books on

00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,570
this like seriously designers don't do a

00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:15,590
thing from scratch we all work off each

00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:19,940
other last bit I want to do some

00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:23,179
reassurance and tell you how my process

00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:25,250
usually go so sitting down working on a

00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:28,730
new design project first thing to do is

00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:30,710
collect inspiration like I just said and

00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:32,420
this is my fili and I just go through

00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,950
and I have all these sites all

00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:36,140
collecting into one folder so I can very

00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:37,820
quickly go through good designs and get

00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,410
inspired and pick out the things I like

00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:41,320
and want to implement in my own design

00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:44,690
now when it comes to sketching though

00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:46,130
this is this person is showing off like

00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:47,900
if you were like trying to sketch and

00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:50,420
keep ideas down don't feel like you have

00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,010
to think something like this this is

00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:55,040
actually the sketches I did for the

00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:57,260
helloweb homepage again like just really

00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:01,940
quick boxes lines etc just helping me

00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:03,290
remember layouts and ideas that I had so

00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,090
don't feel like you have to be in a most

00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:08,780
amazing sketch or just do it as much as

00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:09,950
you can to get your ideas down and then

00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,990
the second thing I want to say is that

00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:14,390
you can i particularly like mock-ups

00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:17,150
because it's easy to change and try

00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:18,950
different ideas your mock-ups don't have

00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:20,960
to be pixel perfect they don't have to

00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,760
be beautiful like this is a lay I did

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,290
for my husband for an idea he had and

00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,850
all we did was trying to figure out with

00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,960
you know this is not gonna be like my

00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,730
white it's not gonna use those colors

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,020
that allowed us to figure out a layout

00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:32,290
and

00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:35,640
things around and see essentially how

00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:38,890
the way it loves website would be used

00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:43,210
all the mock-ups can be cut to look like

00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:45,300
this and then build it but that's a hold

00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,300
on

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,870
so again reinsurance every time this is

00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:52,810
seriously every single time I work on

00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:54,550
design I'm fresh whole graph designer I

00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:59,620
have a graphic design degree this is

00:26:54,550 --> 00:27:01,360
what happens I feel like like the

00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:03,700
ultimate impostor syndrome I feel like

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,670
such a horrible designer every single

00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:08,440
time I start from scratch and if you are

00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:10,300
sitting down and you're working on your

00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,400
yet we're gonna design project you're

00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:15,670
going I'm such a bad designer I'm such a

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,930
beginner you're not a designer everyone

00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:20,290
goes through this it doesn't think means

00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:22,150
that you are a designer kind of pressing

00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:26,410
I'm sorry but hopefully I reshares some

00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:28,210
- this is only a starting point there's

00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:29,760
so much to be said that I only do in a

00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:31,960
short period of time

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,120
remember to view even you're working on

00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,100
something visually focus on clutter and

00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,720
reduce visual clutter and you can do

00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,490
that by keeping the number colors and

00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,230
font flow adding whitespace lining

00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:44,200
things up and keeping your content short

00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:46,770
easy to skim make sure that your goal

00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,820
whatever you're designing whatever your

00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:50,320
you want your action to be make sure

00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:54,040
that you're focusing on making it easy

00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:56,170
I'm easy to find and use keep your

00:27:54,040 --> 00:28:00,630
content short simple and to the point

00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:03,220
and practice practice practice

00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:05,890
this will be the topic of a third book

00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:08,740
hopefully and if you want to be on a

00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:11,880
dedicated mailing list just about book

00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:14,530
that's helloweb opcom slash web design

00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,740
and the rest I really hope this helps

00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:17,790
you out

00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,790
thank you

00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:29,410
hey Tracy thanks for the wonderful talk

00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:32,590
hey my question is like all of these

00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:35,200
separate topics make sense on their own

00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:37,300
but what happens to me very often is

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,030
okay I create us some kind of design and

00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:42,130
then I see it doesn't look good but it's

00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:43,870
just overwhelming I don't know where to

00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:46,960
start like is it the font is it the

00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:48,700
colors is it the spacing do you have any

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,110
advice on that like how to approach when

00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,850
you see it's like something's not

00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:54,040
working but you have no idea what what

00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:55,750
it is one thing I really like to do with

00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:59,380
design is that I mean design would

00:28:55,750 --> 00:29:00,940
necessary design is very qualitative and

00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:03,520
so it's really hard to pick out what's

00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:05,560
working what's not so try to make it as

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,720
quantitate as possible so look at your

00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,580
design try to hook it up to analytics

00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,670
and see how people are actually using it

00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:15,100
and see if then you can start picking

00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:16,420
out maybe some things that change maybe

00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,280
one page is working to another and you

00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:20,470
can look at what's different but then

00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:23,860
you can also change a headline or and

00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:25,960
see if that affects how people use it by

00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:29,230
tying changes you make or decisions you

00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:32,560
make to analytics and data it can help a

00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:34,180
lot that's number one and that kind of

00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:37,030
relies on having something about traffic

00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:38,980
which is hard number two I don't really

00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:41,470
talk about usability testing here but

00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:43,450
simply this is so hard fast someone for

00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:47,230
feedback and see what other people say

00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:49,390
um but I do this in programming I get in

00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:50,920
this bubble and it's really hard to like

00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:52,330
figure out what's working with not and

00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,220
just like bring you to someone else and

00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:55,990
seeing the face maybe they think it's

00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:57,430
fine maybe it's just you maybe because I

00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,440
do that oh my god it's horrible it

00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:02,260
sounds like what are you talking about

00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,850
or they start pointing out what they say

00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:06,190
what they think you have to be careful

00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:08,350
because someone people can be sooo nice

00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:10,090
they're like oh it's fine or they could

00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,800
be like everything is horrible not

00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:13,210
giving a good feedback but just simply

00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:16,300
by having someone look who knows the

00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:18,640
science can help you you know get more

00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,750
information which is important then just

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,760
kind of like going I don't know what's

00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:24,990
going on it's very overwhelming hope

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,990
that helps Thanks

00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:36,450
who's this sorry I what are some

00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:37,799
differences if any between desktop web

00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:39,600
sites and mobile sites ah

00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:42,710
that's another differences between

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,929
desktop and mobile why I like bootstrap

00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:48,029
like seriously I keep I saw at something

00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:50,039
like someone wrote an article saying how

00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:51,330
horrible bootstrap is but like which

00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:53,369
track is your grid and bootstrap gives

00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:56,340
you the ability to do responsive design

00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:58,019
which is awesome because a responsive

00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,249
design making sure your website works in

00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:01,830
browser is really important

00:30:59,249 --> 00:31:02,909
RC being that global in terms of

00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:05,309
differences uh

00:31:02,909 --> 00:31:10,619
I mean that's all gonna pin it on the

00:31:05,309 --> 00:31:17,070
website and what information sorry noise

00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:20,970
this information is there and it's very

00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:22,470
long talk I guess I want to say yeah I

00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:24,629
mean just like a make sure you have a

00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:26,759
mobile site be again and look at

00:31:24,629 --> 00:31:30,809
analytics make sure like if your website

00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:32,070
is performing so like at one point and

00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:34,169
you look at like Google Analytics and

00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:35,759
looking at mobile and like it's way

00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:37,409
worse that could be a good indicator

00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:39,869
that something is wrong and I you should

00:31:37,409 --> 00:31:42,600
update something in general mobile sites

00:31:39,869 --> 00:31:44,730
have to be a simpler unless elements

00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,960
because you're smaller um but there's

00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:47,879
also a lot of good books I think there's

00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:51,779
a whole mobile design book that's on by

00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:54,299
a public apart that's really good yeah

00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:57,840
well well sites very important yeah

00:31:54,299 --> 00:32:01,940
thanks I'm gonna use a four-letter word

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:05,279
here menu yeah what's your thoughts on

00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:08,519
menu design in terms of top left side

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:13,049
right side number of levels of

00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:15,179
indentation etc there's lots of a

00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:17,399
placing for the menu and for anyone who

00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:19,950
is say might think themselves that they

00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:23,609
are new to design I say follow the rules

00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:25,769
don't break them so see what other

00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:27,509
websites competitors or other websites

00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:29,279
you want emulate see what they're doing

00:32:27,509 --> 00:32:33,090
and I said follow that format don't

00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:34,440
create a new format I think usually I

00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:37,109
mean all depends on the menu how many

00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,190
levels are there but if what you're

00:32:37,109 --> 00:32:39,360
designing

00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:41,879
seems like it really works well with a

00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,860
top-level menu and that's what's people

00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:44,669
in your space generally are doing I say

00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,190
go with it

00:32:44,669 --> 00:32:48,809
don't try to do something new or

00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:51,080
revolutionary at least in the beginning

00:32:48,809 --> 00:32:55,730
so you always update it later

00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:57,690
yeah that's hopefully I helped yeah

00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:01,740
thank you

00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:04,610
I'm also new EX designer and it's great

00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:08,129
that you pointed out all the basics I'm

00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:10,919
gonna be really interested about clients

00:33:08,129 --> 00:33:14,909
from hell yeah code you will do deal

00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:16,379
with that in your process there's a how

00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:18,740
do the clients inhale there was a reason

00:33:16,379 --> 00:33:23,789
why I don't do freelance design anymore

00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:27,600
I'm just like can't handle it generally

00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:29,179
when it comes to clients uh in general

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,860
this is going to a really general as

00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:33,690
communication is super important and

00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,919
that's usually where a lot of client

00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,879
problems happen either working with

00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:38,720
someone else and that's actually not

00:33:35,879 --> 00:33:41,000
just clients but say co-workers as well

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,500
like they can make your life hell

00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,169
because they're not explaining what they

00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:48,299
need and then you also aren't doing a

00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:50,009
good explanation of why things are

00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:54,059
better or wife and decisions may be

00:33:50,009 --> 00:33:55,889
booted you were jumping into a freelance

00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:57,750
design I don't have a lot of feedback

00:33:55,889 --> 00:33:59,519
because I just left that world because I

00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:02,129
didn't I was working with one person and

00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,840
they very much insisted on a design

00:34:02,129 --> 00:34:05,610
which was gonna be terrible and they

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,830
kept like making hands of themselves and

00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:09,810
eventually I just checked out and they

00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:11,250
never launched it thank goodness but it

00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:12,210
was a very frustrating process now I was

00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:14,849
like you know I'm gonna build a website

00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:17,970
for myself instead so I have a lot of

00:34:14,849 --> 00:34:19,740
good feedback on that but in general I

00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:21,210
find that a lot of people are missing a

00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:23,639
communication and that's why I would

00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:25,079
probably work on first if I had a client

00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:26,700
that's causing problems just try to be

00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:33,329
really really clear about the benefits

00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:35,520
and try to win them over in my side so

00:34:33,329 --> 00:34:37,139
the way that I learned most programming

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,450
related stuff is go find a good tutorial

00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:41,099
and go through that and then after that

00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:45,119
just kind of read the docs

00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:49,200
yeah so until your book comes out have

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:51,240
you have you found any things like that

00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,020
where it's kind of a guided here's a

00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,909
concept

00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:56,130
you try it now here's the next concept

00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:58,320
now you try it like a way to kind of

00:34:56,130 --> 00:35:01,410
practice coming in with kind of no

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:05,370
design formal design is why I'm writing

00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:07,260
the best I mean there's a lot of summer

00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:08,850
articles out there that my kid my big

00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,530
thing about design with waste hot and

00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:12,360
it's same thing programmers is that

00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:15,330
designer is a teaching design as if they

00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:17,490
at the same level that they are and I

00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:19,710
feel like that's okay also programming

00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:22,860
that you don't teach best practices you

00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:24,150
have to teach the shortcuts and I don't

00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,680
see that a lot in the design world

00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:28,740
because this designer is teaching best

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,000
practices to design stuff especially my

00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,890
good singing like that web developers

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,750
has guide the color um they haven't

00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:35,190
other articles on there they do a lot so

00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:37,020
I think there's some they're not great

00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:39,810
but they have a lot of good things too a

00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:42,420
lot of good writing on on web design in

00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:44,730
general and then book apart I've seen it

00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:47,670
listen apart has lots of great very

00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:50,460
high-level articles the same people who

00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:51,600
do a book apart they're good to read to

00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:55,460
understand what their people are doing

00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:59,520
those ones are a little advancements a

00:35:55,460 --> 00:36:01,650
one more question that are you thanks

00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,170
Percy what's your thought on mobile

00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:06,150
first design as opposed to let's go with

00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:08,220
a go to a desk up for my website and

00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:11,190
then figure out how to break that down

00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:12,660
for robot yeah and so MOA

00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:15,710
first design now such the title of the

00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:18,930
book apart book just really excellent I

00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:21,000
am stuck in my old ways and I always do

00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:22,380
desktop first and I'm not saying that's

00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,560
a great thing

00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,970
it just works best with me uh the way

00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,040
mobile first when you're designing for

00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:30,600
small screens the reason why it's so

00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,370
great is that you were working at less

00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,110
information you have less space you have

00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:36,150
let's face it fool around you have to be

00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:37,590
more concise and that applies to all

00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:39,960
these principles he did for big design

00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:42,030
so if you start small and have to create

00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:44,070
your stuff from scratch on a small

00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:46,020
screen that could make your larger

00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:49,200
screen when you move it over like

00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:51,240
cleaner and easier to read and one on oh

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,210
so that's where mobile first can help

00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:55,560
out a lot I encourage people to try it

00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:57,210
out and see if that works for them

00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:00,660
because it all depends on versus process

00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:02,490
I'm an old fuddy-duddy that like the new

00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,300
world of responsive design still throws

00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:09,340
me off

00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:12,390
I keep doing that's not first alright

00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:12,390
