	The City as Cyborg: A History of Civic Technology in The First Quarter of The 21st Century by Mjumbe Poe

Join us this July, 2056, as we hear Historian Mjumbe Poe give a lecture on the developments in civic technology in the early 21st Century, particularly between the years 2001 and 2026. He will address the major movements in the first quarter of the 21st century that led to the modern notion that cities are, in fact, cyborgs.

come on

00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:29,840
good afternoon so um welcome welcome

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:33,510
welcome um all right and good evening

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,910
welcome to the twenty fifty six cyborg

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,440
city conference throughout this

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,829
conference our various speakers will be

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,020
exploring the idea of the cyborg city

00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:45,929
what it is and what it may mean for our

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:50,059
future so for those that aren't familiar

00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:53,160
with this idea here's the briefest of

00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:55,410
backgrounds as we now know cities are

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,329
alive people have been talking about

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:02,670
cities as living things for centuries

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:04,350
but at least at least centuries but it

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,990
was primarily a philosophical matter of

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,360
discussion until the early 2030s saying

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:13,110
when urbanist scholars started working

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:16,770
with life scientists and started to

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:19,790
develop a a rigorous classification

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,729
system for various types of human

00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:26,850
environments this was the beginning of

00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:28,380
biological urbanism since then there

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,540
have been progressively fewer questions

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,390
about whether cities are alive but over

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,969
the last few years we've begun to ask

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:40,079
well if City if the city is alive then

00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:42,119
is it a cyborg with respect to this

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,700
topic in particular the cyborg city I'm

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,930
interested in if the city is a cyborg

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:51,000
how did it become so and for that matter

00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:53,070
what even makes us ask the question

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,490
where does our interest in the city as a

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,350
cyborg come from so we begin to answer

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,689
these questions I believe we can turn to

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,530
the period in history from which we saw

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:06,960
to coincident phenomena one is the rise

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,030
in various technologies that mediated

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,680
the relationship between cities and

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:18,240
their residents or what was then called

00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:21,180
Civic technology the second phenomenon

00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:25,230
is our own increasing comfort with the

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,730
idea that our use of networked info

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,659
mation technology was becoming as

00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:35,400
central to who we are as human beings as

00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:38,420
language or as society this is a

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,319
phenomenon that some have referred to as

00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,349
cyborg graphic ation it's kind of a

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:47,190
mouthful for me but that is the going

00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:49,830
term these days so this period roughly

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:53,819
encompasses the first quarter of this

00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:55,430
century the 21st century so in this talk

00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:59,220
I'm going to give a brief overview of

00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:01,379
this time in roughly half decade

00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,739
intervals but I want to start a little

00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:07,799
bit before the beginning of the century

00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:11,129
because there this this period of the

00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:14,549
90s is the immediate precursor and there

00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:15,959
are some important very important

00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:18,989
questions that come up during this

00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:24,349
period that set the stage for the cyborg

00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:26,849
city so in this period in the 90s

00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:28,799
actually shortly before the 90s the

00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:34,519
world wide web is invented but the first

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:37,079
web browser is implemented in the 90s

00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:39,269
Microsoft's Internet Explorer emerges as

00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:41,370
the browser of choice among people

00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:43,680
developing for the web after a period

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:47,760
known as the browser Wars which was not

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:53,099
actually an armed struggle portals are

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:55,739
seen as the future of the web my

00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:58,680
personal website at this time i was i

00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:00,720
was a teenager but my personal website

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,030
is on geo cities and my search engine of

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,940
choice is hot but because i'm a cool kid

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:09,030
which is code speak for nerd google is

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:12,900
born but has not yet become the cultural

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:14,400
giant that it will the same is true of

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,590
the first generation of children that

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,359
will not know a world without the

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:30,930
internet so it's difficult to pinpoint

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:34,289
the exact time that our consciousness

00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:36,599
becomes entwined with our computers but

00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:38,590
this was a period that saw our empathy

00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:41,950
for the machines we used

00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:46,210
become mainstream and it may just be

00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:49,330
that it was a natural progression of

00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:51,040
history but the marketing of apple

00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:54,670
products and the second Steve Jobs era

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:58,960
may have also had a fair bit to do with

00:04:54,670 --> 00:05:02,500
that so that era started here so we're

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,480
going to go forward to the beginning of

00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,450
the 21st century and as we enter the

00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,670
21st century college students on little

00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,770
Ivies around the country are feeling

00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,510
special because their school is one of

00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,570
the few that can use the exclusive new

00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:18,610
social network called Facebook they

00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:22,300
eagerly share their class schedules with

00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:27,100
each other no one's mother is yet on

00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:29,800
Facebook collaborative editing becomes a

00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:32,740
thing wikipedia and a few years later

00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,570
openstreetmap are what will become two

00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,270
of the larger platforms that popularized

00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,520
this phenomenon they're both at least in

00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:42,040
part a response to the lack of free and

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,290
open sources of their respective data in

00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,570
ideological motivation much like that of

00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:49,300
the early open source software

00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:53,530
components if you realize nothing else

00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:57,880
about history realized that it operates

00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:59,950
in cycles of varying lengths so the

00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,840
earliest organizations that would become

00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:04,510
known explicitly as Civic technology

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,700
organizations begin to sprout up in this

00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:10,030
period between around two thousand and

00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:13,540
two thousand and five they have names

00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:15,040
like open plans and my society and they

00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:18,670
don't really know what they're doing

00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:23,590
because no one's done it before but they

00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:26,910
do it with gusto the first Civic

00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:31,060
applications also start to be released

00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:33,220
none of them have pictures and all of

00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,710
them have white backgrounds black text

00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,950
and blue hyperlinks as if any other

00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:40,030
colors are too frivolous to manage

00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,980
electoral political campaigns in the

00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:45,040
United States begin to experiment with

00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:46,510
engaging potential voters particularly

00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,210
on the younger end of the spectrum

00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:51,070
through electronic means however

00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,000
incumbent governments show a little

00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,550
interest in doing

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,830
same many governments begin to have a

00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,260
presence on the web though their sites

00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:03,490
function as little more than glorified

00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:09,660
page about pages and look almost as good

00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:12,190
as my geocities site so this next period

00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,110
between about two thousand six and two

00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,750
thousand ten this next period has a

00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,610
couple of very significant events in it

00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,110
and you know I'm not going to be able to

00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:22,390
get to all of the significant events in

00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:24,360
any of these periods because it turns

00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:27,910
out that a lot happens in the course of

00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,980
three decades but we're going to start

00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,870
with talking about Kenya so in 2007

00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:35,290
Kenya's going through a contentious and

00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:36,669
in some cases a dangerous general

00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:41,110
election with scattered reports of

00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:42,940
violent intimidation of voters of voters

00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,980
and what is emerging as the Civic

00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,870
hacking community around the world this

00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,240
story becomes one of a small group of

00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:51,520
Kenyan developers creating a system that

00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,890
uses the crowd so to speak the masses of

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,390
voting public as a primary source of

00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,100
information about intimidation and

00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,990
violence at polling places for the

00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:02,470
purpose of creating greater transparency

00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:06,580
around what's going on they call this

00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:08,200
system Ushahidi so during this period a

00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:13,180
number of other technologies based

00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:15,850
around crowdsourcing emerged and though

00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,590
these are not the first examples of this

00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,570
crowd sourcing method and if you recall

00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,979
Wikipedia and openstreetmap are two

00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:23,620
examples from the previous time period

00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:25,870
that use the same methods but the

00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,330
practice was not explicitly identified

00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:31,750
and named until this period specifically

00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:36,190
in Wired magazine and at Wired magazine

00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:38,440
article in 2006 so the surge in

00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:40,390
technological progress has a detrimental

00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:44,020
effect on several industries one of

00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:46,930
which is the printed news media the john

00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:49,360
s and James L knight Foundation takes to

00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:51,370
funding projects that rethink news media

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,339
for the changing times one of those

00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:58,210
early projects that they fund is every

00:08:54,339 --> 00:09:01,440
block which aims to provide a hyperlocal

00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,440
or micro local news

00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:09,170
so an interesting and spontaneous type

00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:13,370
of crowd-sourced transparency also

00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:16,850
emerges in this period as well a tragic

00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:18,620
one in fact early in the morning on New

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,290
Year's Day of 2009 at the fruitvale bart

00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:24,470
station in Oakland California Oscar

00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:26,210
Grant is shot and killed by a BART

00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:30,320
police officer while handcuffed and

00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:33,140
laying face down on the platform this

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,390
event is independently video recorded by

00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,400
several bystanders uploaded to youtube

00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:41,450
and also shared with what are at this

00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:44,690
point the traditional media outlets this

00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:47,690
and later events would not have been

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:50,420
able to be captured and disseminated in

00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,740
quite the same way were not for other

00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:56,420
developments during this period

00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:58,580
specifically the release of the iphone

00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,550
and the android operating systems and

00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:03,740
the resultant explosions and the

00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:07,340
popularity of portable devices capable

00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:09,080
of making those recordings as well as

00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:13,280
the launch of video sharing services

00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:16,730
such as youtube and their subsequent use

00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:20,420
me their subsequent acquisition by

00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:23,630
google also most governments now have a

00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:26,120
presence on the web though their sites

00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:29,120
function as a little more than glorified

00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:35,000
about pages and look almost as good as

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:39,370
my geocities site so in the next period

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,410
between around 2011 and 2015 and

00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:44,660
bleeding into the following the five

00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:46,970
years following this is a big time for

00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,110
governments getting into this game Code

00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,790
for America an organization that

00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:51,070
originally works with local governments

00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,420
to bring bleeding-edge technology

00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:56,090
practice to bear on government projects

00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,650
is founded in 2010 but starts actually

00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:01,040
serving cities with their fellowship

00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:02,690
program in 2011 later this year Code for

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,100
America also launches their brigade

00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,320
program to establish pockets of

00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,840
technologists and actually this is the

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,240
first class of the fellows if you see

00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,130
over on your right that is a much

00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:20,120
younger and sprightly version

00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:22,070
me in the UK the government digital

00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,450
service is founded with the mandate to

00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:25,250
transform the way that the UK government

00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:27,290
deliver services to their residents

00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:30,320
employing a digital by default strategy

00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:31,910
and this work inspires and informs a lot

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,710
of other work that then happens in the

00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:35,930
united states and cities such as

00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:37,910
Philadelphia New York Boston and San

00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:43,630
Diego and how they start to rebuild

00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:46,310
their own websites this period also sees

00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:50,180
some important conversations around

00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:53,480
privacy and security Edward Snowden

00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:56,480
leaks a whole host of files obtained by

00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,130
obtained from the NSA which helps to

00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,360
spark an ongoing conversation

00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:07,280
conversation that will continue

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:11,030
throughout the decade also during this

00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:14,090
period we see more killings of African

00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,780
Americans particularly those unarmed at

00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,820
the hands of law enforcement

00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:19,250
professionals including a partial list

00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:21,650
of Michael Brown Eric garner Tamir rice

00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:24,380
Eric Harris Walter Scott Jonathan

00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:28,760
Ferrell Sandra bland Samuel DuBose and

00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:30,590
Freddie gray and these events sparked

00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,450
the black lives matter movement which

00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:36,080
heavily leverages platforms such as

00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:39,950
Twitter Facebook and Instagram in a way

00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:48,530
that similar or other movements have not

00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:56,690
up to this point the period from twenty

00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:58,250
sixteen to twenty twenty oh well didn't

00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,430
expect that wrong order the period from

00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:04,790
twenty sixteen to twenty twenty in this

00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:06,260
period we see several events many of

00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:11,150
which I will not have time to get into

00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:13,040
but some of those events include a

00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:15,170
string of cases which local in which

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,480
local and federal government issue

00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:20,630
subpoenas to gain access to defendants

00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:25,730
encrypted phone data and these

00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:26,540
conversations go on to inform a host of

00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:32,690
other

00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:34,900
our trials and court findings around the

00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:39,920
nature of the relationship between

00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:45,020
individuals and their data we also began

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:48,700
to see very early diagnosed cases of

00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:51,440
what is known as vicarious trauma a

00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:53,830
phenomenon previously most commonly

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,750
associated with professional counselors

00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:59,210
we see this we see this case in the

00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:01,460
general public these cases come as a

00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:04,100
result of the constant and emergent and

00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:07,640
immersive exposure the tragedy and

00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:10,160
injustice around the world so in the

00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:13,610
following period in the period from 2021

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:17,240
to about 20-25 we see a rise in private

00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:21,320
cloud services in response to the in

00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:24,500
response to the the the data the data

00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:27,410
privacy concerns in the immediately

00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,090
previous periods instead of relying on

00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:32,690
large organisations such as Google and

00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:35,030
Facebook to manage both people's data

00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:40,490
and their services a top it becomes

00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:42,920
popular to procure procure private

00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:47,830
servers to host your own data in

00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:52,040
addition we see services such as Google

00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:54,200
opening up their platforms to both work

00:14:52,040 --> 00:15:00,860
with the data that they host as well as

00:14:54,200 --> 00:15:05,150
the private hosted data in order to in

00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:09,920
order to keep the customers that they

00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:11,120
that they have add up to that point the

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,210
customer base that they've up to that

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,830
point built also during this period

00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:20,110
following the lead of the federal

00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:24,370
organization 18f the national conference

00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,370
the National Conference of Mayors

00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:35,460
endorses a tour of duty initiative

00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,460
sounds good

00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:46,600
in this initiative technologists are

00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:49,600
encouraged to give one to two years of

00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:53,740
service to various local city

00:15:49,600 --> 00:16:07,209
governments working on working on their

00:15:53,740 --> 00:16:17,620
staff as part of the civil service this

00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:21,160
program this program leads to a a large

00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:23,370
increase in the number of technology

00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:28,839
professionals working in government and

00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:37,620
a a rapid improvement in the provision

00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:44,529
of government digital services at the

00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:47,339
20-26 django con we are privileged to

00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:51,270
see a talk from a grizzled and

00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,270
experienced Andrew Godwin

00:16:52,399 --> 00:17:00,149
where he gives us his latest invention

00:16:54,839 --> 00:17:04,199
and at the conclusion of his talk asks

00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:06,809
us the following questions questions

00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:10,919
which resonate well and resonate deeply

00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:15,240
with the the crowd of technologists and

00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:17,870
early adopters who are who are embracing

00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:22,399
their own cyborg nature well ahead of

00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:28,490
the the general public who will not for

00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:32,789
another decade or so these questions are

00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:39,899
around the notion of where we will be in

00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:42,539
10 years he says in 1995 you are a

00:17:39,899 --> 00:17:47,490
desktop app which again resonates

00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:53,460
strongly with cyborg aware technologists

00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:58,350
in 2005 you are a website in 2015 you

00:17:53,460 --> 00:18:01,289
are a rich mobile app in 20-25 you are a

00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:05,519
bio sensitive application where will we

00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:07,830
be in 20 35 from 2056 we have the

00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:11,850
perspective to be able to answer that

00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:15,090
question but this was an interesting and

00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:19,769
intriguing question when Godwin posed it

00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:22,619
at the 20-26 general come so in

00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:27,539
conclusion the idea of civic technology

00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:30,330
is the most it is not Civic technology

00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:32,610
itself any particular application that

00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:34,889
came out of this period of the first

00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:36,779
quarter of the 21st century that is most

00:18:34,889 --> 00:18:39,029
interesting about civic technology it's

00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:41,460
the idea of civic tech itself the idea

00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:43,169
that technology can and should mediate

00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:46,499
our relationship with our cities and

00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:47,970
that that is a positive value that that

00:18:46,499 --> 00:18:50,039
is an important thing that that is

00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:56,240
something that can make our lives in our

00:18:50,039 --> 00:19:00,179
cities better moreover as time goes on

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,340
the notion of civic technology as a term

00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:03,980
is going to fall out a favor or has

00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:07,100
fallen out of favor

00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:10,669
as all digital technology in some way

00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:12,919
becomes civic to say civic technology is

00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:15,679
like saying a civic road or a civic

00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:18,110
bridge the important technology that

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:22,309
we're building these days is civic

00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:30,100
technology other technology is what it

00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:32,840
is and over time we have learned much

00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:36,860
learns to be much more aware of the

00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:38,450
context of the inventions that we put

00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,370
out into the world the inventions that

00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:47,059
we create the technology that we create

00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:52,450
and we are better off for it and that is

00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:52,450
oh that's it

00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,740
thank you so much for that very

00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:09,120
interesting presentation for to break

00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:12,299
the fourth wall for a moment and bring

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:15,240
us back into 2 2016 what should those of

00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:18,929
us who are wanting to prepare for our

00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:21,059
lives as technologists whose primary

00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:23,010
concern is mediating that relationship

00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:24,570
with our cities be doing to encourage

00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:27,210
that relationship and make that a

00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:30,240
constructive relationship does that make

00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:33,540
sense is that a question well it is a

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:36,000
question just a Lardon i think i think

00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:38,010
the i think the thing the most important

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,360
thing is to just be 0 again be aware of

00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:43,530
the context in which are creating in

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:50,990
preparing for this talk i did a series

00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:53,570
of conversations around politics and

00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:56,490
education and and so on and so forth

00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:58,290
because i didn't want to just be

00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:02,460
thinking about ok where is technology

00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:05,760
going to be going in the next 10 15 25

00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:07,650
40 years it's important to think more

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,210
we're a society going to be going and

00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:13,440
what kind of technology do we need in

00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:15,690
order to bring that about so be aware of

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,320
context is the most important thing I

00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,320
think we can all do

00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:35,810
are we in 25 2056 2056 out Aisling I

00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:40,610
like it there um how do you feel about

00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:44,600
the the trade-offs between the increased

00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:47,510
awareness and specificity of public

00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:52,670
health data due to the large number of

00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:58,130
implants compared to the evolution of

00:21:52,670 --> 00:22:03,710
very evolution of various hacking

00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:07,580
attacks upon those implanted devices it

00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:13,330
it comes with the territory every new

00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:13,330
technology comes with its own set of of

00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:23,300
dangers of perils this was no different

00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:25,790
in 2006 and it is in 2056 except for the

00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:28,280
fact that there are people who are

00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:32,030
choosing to get embedded devices now and

00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:35,630
it is a little bit you know there that

00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:39,500
that does bring some unease for some

00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:41,840
people however you know most of the

00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:46,220
younger folks that I've run into these

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:48,530
days are prepared to live with that

00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:50,990
possibility and prepared to protect

00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:54,320
against it as well because of the
