Description: 
	Stress Testing Your Code of Conduct in Production by Ola Sendecka  & Baptiste Mispelon

The Django and Python communities have made codes of conducts a standard feature for many years now. But what exactly is a code of conduct? How does it work in practice? Why do we need them? What you should report? What are the consequences of having one?

We (Ola & Baptiste) have been working as CoC points of contacts at many conferences for the past few years: EuroPython 2014, DjangoCon Europe (2015 and 2016), and Django Under the Hood (2014, 2015). This has given us a unique insight into the inner workings and practical implications of codes of conducts and we want to share it with the Django community.

The talk will start with a brief history of codes of conducts. From then, we'll go over some of the challenges and pitfalls of implementing a CoC in our communities or events. After that, we'll show how CoC work in practice and answer some common questions about them. We will then briefly talk about how lessons learnt from CoC world can be applied successfully in your daily job to grow supportive and strong teams. Finally, we'll finish off by showing the new standardized CoC processes that we've been working on.

With this talk, we want to continue the process we've started of bringing CoC to the front of the stage, making them more transparent and less taboo. We believe that CoC are an essential part of any community and we'd like to share our vision for how we think ours should work.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,450
come on

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,770
hello everyone it's a really really

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,830
great pleasure and an immense honor to

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,080
be standing here today we both know it's

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:28,470
been a very very long day it's very hot

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,239
outside very cold inside there's been

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,680
lots of amazing talks today a lot of

00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,590
taking so we're really really glad that

00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:38,360
you decided to come to ours so today

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:42,360
we're going to be talking about code a

00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:44,370
code of conduct so the code of conduct

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,910
or we're probably going to refer it to

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,859
it as COC from now on it can be a quite

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,480
a sensitive topic and personally I

00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:54,059
didn't feel like I could present this

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,760
just just on my own but looking today

00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:00,510
I'm not a long stage and company here by

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,100
my good friend Allah so Allah she's a

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,010
long long time number of the gem

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,750
community as was said before she lives

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,450
in London where she works for a company

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,060
called potato but she's originally from

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,680
Poland you probably know her the most

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,689
for co-founding the jungle girls

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,030
initiative but she has many many other

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:22,470
talents she's organized several genuine

00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:25,740
including one that was held in a circus

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:27,450
tent in Poland and she also has her own

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,939
YouTube channel where she teaches

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:35,250
programming to women and I wouldn't be

00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:37,530
yeah ok cool and I couldn't be more

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,530
grateful to have a patties of my

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,840
co-presenter he lives in Hungary but

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,909
he's originally from France and while

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,680
working with him with various community

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:49,289
projects I discovered that he all has

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,990
this gift that always put other people

00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:54,030
before himself and it it is visible in

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,469
everything he does in his contribution

00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:01,049
as a jungle court developer in his

00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:04,530
skills and what he does as a conference

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:06,990
organizers and also in his working with

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,030
jungle girls and but this is also the

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,350
person you want to find if you want to

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,300
translate something from English to

00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:15,960
emoji

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:18,480
and together with in working seoc points

00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:21,330
of contacts at five major python and

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,880
django conferences over last three years

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:27,870
and even though we don't consider

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,790
ourself experts and we hope that in our

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,590
talk will answer at least some of the

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,870
question you might have a regarding code

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:37,290
of conduct and at this point I want to

00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:40,350
stress out that even though things will

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:43,160
talk about in this talk are based on our

00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:46,050
conference and events and experiences

00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,790
you can take the lessons we learn and

00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:52,380
apply them to your workplace or

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:54,870
open-source project or literally any you

00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:58,130
any place where people meet and interact

00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,750
and this is because code of conduct and

00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:05,760
culturally go together side by side and

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:07,770
one is reflected in another so I want to

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,080
start by just explaining what we won't

00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,870
be talking about so we're not here to

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,120
discuss whether your community company

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,190
your project requires code of conduct or

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,959
not there are many resources online we'd

00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,940
already have the time for it I think

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,270
it's best summed up by this tweet from

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:28,560
Lana Reinhard let's let you read for a

00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:30,239
while basically to sum it up at the

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,800
moment you have humans interacting you

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,860
want to have a code of conduct there's

00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,360
just no way around it also we believe

00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,370
that the genuine community as a whole

00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,050
has kind of moved past this point where

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,330
we're just arguing about whether we need

00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:45,600
one and we just accept as a fact that we

00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:48,959
are community action each one so instead

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,580
today we'd rather focus on how you

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,220
actually implement a good code of

00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,900
conduct in production so to speak we'd

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,640
like to explain what it means in

00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,410
practice to have a code of conduct with

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,540
some complete examples that we've had

00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,550
over the years and some tips that we've

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,930
learned along the way but before we do

00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,209
that we want to start with a bit of

00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,730
history of code of condoms inside our

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:10,800
communities and it's very hard to

00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:12,900
determine when first movements to

00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,940
implement code of conduct in tech

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,400
industry start of it and there is a lot

00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:20,070
of people who worked really hard to make

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,610
code of conduct a standard and we are

00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:25,140
incredibly grateful for they work and

00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,500
there are too many people to name them

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,080
here

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:31,110
so we just want to say a big thank you

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,270
to all amazing people who dedicated

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,970
their time and effort to make code of

00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:38,580
conduct a thing and really our community

00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:41,820
really stands on the shoulders of the

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:44,040
giants but going back to jungle and

00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,190
fightin community we did some research

00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,990
and establish that 2012 was a year when

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:52,440
code of conduct started to the important

00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:55,770
topic and pipe in the US implemented one

00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:58,890
in March 2012 followed by jungle Kong

00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:01,950
Europe in Surrey in May and at the end

00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:04,290
of the year on 21st of November fighter

00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:07,230
software foundation and force conference

00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:10,260
organizers to have code of conduct at

00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:12,750
any event they want to sponsor and

00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,400
similarly on January ninth of the

00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,080
following year the Jenga software

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,580
foundation be exactly the same and the

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,620
board voted that it would only found

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,860
events that had a code of conduct and

00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,810
later on a few month later in April the

00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,760
Bison community adopted could have

00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,620
collect as a whole for the community for

00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,080
it all its online spaces and they were

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,790
followed very soon after enjoyed by the

00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,190
gem committee who did exactly the same

00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:37,830
and the important thing here is to

00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:39,930
realize that John Doe community started

00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:43,370
discussion about code of conduct quite

00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:46,140
early at least this is what I feel and

00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:48,690
we improved immensely and code of

00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:51,270
conduct is present and visible and at

00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:53,520
not only a drag on Python conferences

00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:56,390
but also in online spaces where our

00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:00,240
community interacts and we don't discuss

00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:02,550
if and why we need it and we discuss how

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,800
to improve it and the jungle code of

00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:06,750
conduct was even showcased as a good

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,600
example of the community code of conduct

00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:11,550
by other initiative and I think we

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,919
should be really proud of jungle

00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:17,370
community to for being really

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:21,810
forward-thinking and striving to be nice

00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:24,240
and welcoming place for everyone but

00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:25,409
even do we find that Theo Cesar kind of

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,539
standard

00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:30,209
our communities in practice it's not

00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:31,409
always so easy you can just put a piece

00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:33,599
of text on your website for your

00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:36,959
conference or your community and just be

00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:38,999
done with it it's only when you deploy

00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,709
to production that you start to interact

00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:42,749
with real users that you actually start

00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:45,929
to see edge cases and things that you

00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:48,719
hadn't thought about during last year's

00:06:45,929 --> 00:06:50,550
when we serve as members of various code

00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:52,860
of conduct response teams we learned our

00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:55,110
sure and the response team is

00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,300
responsible for enforcing code of

00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:02,009
conduct they receive the reports and are

00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:04,169
in charge pending that and believe me we

00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:06,479
were far from being perfect and we have

00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:09,239
a whole list of things that we wish we

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,589
did better and because we think that you

00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:11,969
can learn from our mistakes we're just

00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:13,709
going to give you a few examples of the

00:07:11,969 --> 00:07:14,969
things that we wish we had known in

00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:16,469
advance so for example there was a

00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:17,939
conference where we had a slight channel

00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,769
similar to why we have this year

00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:21,659
attendees could talk with each other and

00:07:19,769 --> 00:07:23,819
arrange dinners and stuff like that and

00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:25,229
for us it was a big experiment we didn't

00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,149
really think about it too much didn't

00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:28,889
think about the consequences and with

00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:30,629
hindsight I think even though it worked

00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:32,429
really really well we did a few mistakes

00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:34,259
like for example one of them is that we

00:07:32,429 --> 00:07:36,029
never clarified from the start whether

00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,319
this was going to be like a one-time

00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:38,909
thing just for the duration of the

00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,619
conference or whether it was going to

00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:43,079
live forever after and if it was going

00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:45,240
to be moderated forever we just created

00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:47,639
it and then we kind of let it on its own

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,009
after the conference was over and

00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:52,409
another problem we made was that we

00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:54,209
never set up explicit rules from the

00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:57,239
start we just assume people would behave

00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:58,529
and be fine so we didn't say whether you

00:07:57,239 --> 00:08:00,209
could send private messages to people

00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:02,819
without being prompted whether we could

00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:05,069
advertise send job postings like none of

00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:07,499
these things and actually ended up

00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:10,529
protect creating problems because two of

00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:12,449
the members they understood these

00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:17,610
implicit rules differently as it always

00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:19,709
happens and this was a problem and here

00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:21,479
you see that when you create a space for

00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:23,399
people to interact whether it's a space

00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:25,709
in the physical world like here today or

00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:27,629
whether it's a space online where people

00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:29,879
go and talk to each other you need

00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:31,280
always to set explicit rules and not

00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,229
rely on just an employee

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,060
understand and you also need to think

00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:36,620
clearly and in advance about the

00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,780
boundaries of the space you're creating

00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:41,150
and I mean boundaries in terms of space

00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,560
like where does the conference ended

00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,900
when does he start but also in terms of

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,090
time as as in this online space is going

00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:50,360
to be available forever or just for a

00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:53,300
short time at another event there was

00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,640
another example of something we haven't

00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,710
thought through well enough we decided

00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,710
to make code of conduct very visible we

00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:03,050
put a lot of effort to create welcoming

00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:06,140
and safe space we had like dedicated

00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:08,030
phone numbers for code of conduct we had

00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,950
posters reminding what code of conduct

00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:14,120
even like leg lifts or elevators

00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:16,850
whatever is right word in u.s. I don't

00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:21,620
know we had posters reminding about code

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:23,600
of conduct and yeah we emails never

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,420
emailed attendees we reminded about that

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,270
and even though we put so much effort we

00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:31,339
forgot something super crucial and and

00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:35,210
the thing was that we had no dedicated

00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:38,000
code of conduct email so whenever you

00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:41,660
want to use an email you had to write

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,220
all organizers so you either found one

00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,740
of our emergency numbers which is not

00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:49,850
perfect if you are like me and you hate

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:52,790
phoning strange people especially in

00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:55,160
foreign language or you try to find some

00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:58,010
people from response team and the people

00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,750
were all over the place another week

00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:01,520
mistake we made at the same conference

00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,140
had to do with social media we were

00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,150
using Twitter and we had a visual

00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,710
conference hashtag which again was great

00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,140
because people can just go to one place

00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:10,760
and see everything that was happening

00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,710
but but we weren't really monitoring it

00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,990
closely and we were also very quick to

00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:16,850
just rebroadcast like retweeting like

00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:20,060
things that we just so without looking

00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:21,680
too much into them and again social

00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,720
media is yet another space that you're

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,490
creating that you need to have explicit

00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,010
rules for but also you want to be able

00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:30,050
to monitor it like you want to have

00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:32,690
someone who has the ability technically

00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:36,410
and time wise to monitor and react when

00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:38,510
things happen on social media space at

00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,790
another conference we totally

00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:42,360
underestimated how much effort it is to

00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,579
handle code of conduct issues

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,880
and he had a small team just two of us

00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:49,680
and we also had other responsibilities

00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,390
and we ended up just like dropping

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,800
whatever we're doing for the conference

00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:55,320
because we had to deal with code of

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,110
conduct and it is so much easier to have

00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,510
a bigger team and dedicated only to

00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:04,459
couple of contact and also it makes sure

00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:06,540
that you will not burning out of the way

00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:08,430
another thing we did wrong was that we

00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,589
had a conference party so it was an

00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:12,540
after hours event and we never really

00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:14,550
clarify whether this was an official

00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,829
party that means whether the code of

00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,660
conduct apply to this and this resulted

00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:20,910
in fact that some people attended the

00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,860
party and let's say they lost their

00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,390
sense of responsibility because they

00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,550
didn't really think that the code of

00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:28,500
conduct applied there and we see this

00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,480
pattern yet again like you have this

00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,190
space and it needs to have explicit

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,350
rules because you can't rely on implicit

00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,790
rules and you need to know what is

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,680
acceptable what is not what is the

00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,120
conference and what is not and what are

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,500
the rules for each space because each

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,399
facemate have may have slightly

00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:46,709
different rules at one of the

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,350
conferences we also had unwritten no

00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:51,690
comments on the question policy but we

00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:54,449
didn't communicate that clearly and that

00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:57,269
created very awkward moments and after

00:11:54,449 --> 00:12:00,240
some talks for speakers because our

00:11:57,269 --> 00:12:03,420
men's he interrupted some people making

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,190
a comment and and when we realized that

00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,199
we made the policy more clear and an

00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:09,060
outside of state but we wish you were

00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:12,720
more clear at the very beginning and

00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,980
about that and one last example of

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,019
things that we wish we hadn't done

00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,630
better was that there was a conference

00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:21,000
where we didn't have a dedicated this

00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:22,740
physical room to handle code of conduct

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,779
issues we had the organizers room which

00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,459
is great but then organizers who were

00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:28,079
not on the response team just kept

00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:31,140
popping in and out and interrupting and

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,300
you don't want that the COC issues can

00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,949
be tricky can be sensitive you don't do

00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,350
them in a crowded hallway where people

00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:40,399
are passing by but you also want to

00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:43,350
limit it to only the response team so

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,750
you want to make sure that you have it

00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:47,250
doesn't have to be big but a room I

00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,730
space somewhere that can be closed and

00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:52,389
where you can handle code of

00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:54,699
issues as you can see we are indeed far

00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:57,010
from being perfect and all these things

00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:58,990
we just talked about happen even though

00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:01,740
we're like super dedicated to make it

00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:04,839
right and we put a lot of effort to

00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:07,449
create a welcoming space and dealing

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,699
with code of conduct issues is hard and

00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:12,370
you will never have it one hundred

00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:14,410
percent right and it's in leaving

00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:17,110
evolving process and there will be

00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:20,709
always something that is unexpected that

00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:22,149
you are not prepared to so one of the

00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:24,699
most critical thing you can do is just

00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:26,860
plan for failure because you will

00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:28,930
probably mess up and that things will

00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,310
happen and some of them adjust won't

00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:33,220
really be a big deal but some of them

00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:35,680
they might be so you need to know how to

00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,449
handle failure like this so one of the

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,610
things you need to do is make sure you

00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:41,139
have a way to receive feedback listen on

00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:44,290
it and act on it and make sure you know

00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:47,019
how to apologize simply you need to make

00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:49,570
sure you have a process for you when you

00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:52,029
make a mistake you want to document this

00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:53,769
failure of organizer and analyze and

00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:56,620
later so that you can understand what

00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:59,740
went wrong and then correct so that you

00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:02,500
can improve and also you want to be very

00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,750
public about this I think because owning

00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:08,529
up to your mistakes in public it can be

00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,850
trust me a very humbling experience but

00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:12,370
it sends a really really powerful

00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,720
message and a really positive message

00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,790
throughout your community that you

00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,329
really do care and these things do

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:22,149
matter and in the way some code of

00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:24,610
conduct issues are not a big deal if you

00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:26,920
made a move made a sound joke that

00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:28,990
non-native speaker could understand and

00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,670
made them feel awkward for example well

00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:34,750
it's just a joke it's not a big deal

00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:37,389
right you meant well it's just a mistake

00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:40,029
and in a way it's not a big deal from

00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:43,329
the offender point of view and when

00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:45,190
someone reports you accept some really

00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:47,470
serious offenses couple of conduct is

00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:50,260
not aimed to like make you feel

00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:52,380
unwelcome and you don't need to acquit

00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:54,970
never speak to anyone in the community

00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:58,120
you are still valuable member of the

00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:01,269
community but at the same time it is a

00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,100
big deal because a tiny little comment

00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:04,019
you just did

00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:07,110
my PA thousand won the person is hurt

00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:10,500
and they might just quit after that and

00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:13,199
there is a term for that def by thousand

00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,139
cuts so what matters from code of

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:18,329
conduct response team point of view is

00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:20,519
objective outcome of your actions if you

00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:22,500
actually exclude someone from our

00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,990
community will up and give you necessary

00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:28,639
feedback so you will know better next

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:31,829
time and you have chance to improve and

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:35,519
we believe that by handling the small

00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:37,769
things very seriously we we hope to

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:41,009
build a trust so more people will play

00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:44,759
okay to share their concerns and speak

00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:46,500
up with they need at what happens when

00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:48,810
someone speaks up concretely what

00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,699
happens when someone father could have

00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:52,380
hung up report I think it's one of the

00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:55,170
things that can often seem very

00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:57,720
mysterious it's scary sometimes even it

00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:59,819
feels taboo and we wanted to kind of

00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,279
open this up and clarify what actually

00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:03,990
happens and so we made up this kind of

00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:05,399
completely random example and simplify

00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:08,160
example to show you the process that we

00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:10,139
go through when we get report so say we

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,319
are the conference this one and we get a

00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:15,480
report by email saying that here's tweet

00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:17,100
someone's making fun from over speaker

00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,230
who's on stage and they're using the

00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,810
conference hashtag so how do we respond

00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:24,120
so first thing to do is to let the

00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:26,610
reporter know that we received the

00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,130
report and we will take care of that and

00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:31,470
this is important because it means that

00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:33,899
we take responsibility of the situation

00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:37,500
and we'll take care of handling that and

00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:39,720
as our organizer you probably want to do

00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:43,290
that on your own handle the issue

00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:46,439
because otherwise people might try to

00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:48,180
find the dust days or like do the public

00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:51,839
claiming and it might be very very

00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:54,649
serious and it is also crucial to let

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:57,600
the reporter know that you you're

00:16:54,649 --> 00:17:01,139
dealing with this and to have a paper

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,000
trail of what happened next up we gather

00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:05,549
the response team so that we can talk

00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,770
about the incident we can coordinate a

00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:10,350
response assigned tasks to everyone and

00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,169
one of the benefits here of having team

00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:13,209
is that

00:17:11,169 --> 00:17:15,069
it's much much easier to make hard

00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:16,689
decisions as a group as opposed to as an

00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:19,119
individual which you might have to do

00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:20,769
and the practical consequence of having

00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,899
a team is that you need to have

00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:25,539
communication channel with this team and

00:17:22,899 --> 00:17:27,489
it needs to be private so that nobody

00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:30,399
else has access to it and it needs to be

00:17:27,489 --> 00:17:32,200
real time so that you can act quickly so

00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:33,820
for example we've used many times a

00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,580
private slack channel and it just it

00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,499
works very well for that at this point

00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,899
we'll take screenshots and try to gather

00:17:38,499 --> 00:17:44,109
as much information about the incident

00:17:40,899 --> 00:17:46,869
as possible so we quickly determined

00:17:44,109 --> 00:17:48,759
that in that person making the tweet is

00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:51,759
in fact an attendee they posted the

00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:54,009
photo mayor badge and earlier and we can

00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:57,039
cross-check it with a list of attendees

00:17:54,009 --> 00:17:59,139
and gathering facts early means that you

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,559
don't need to rely on your memory later

00:17:59,139 --> 00:18:04,749
and you can concentrate on other things

00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:06,039
so we met with the response team and at

00:18:04,749 --> 00:18:09,100
the end of the meeting with all together

00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:10,779
decided about our next action so in our

00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:14,139
case will be speaking with a person and

00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:16,090
ask them to do it to tweet it could hear

00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:17,739
to have an idea before you go in the

00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,090
meeting with a person of how you're

00:18:17,739 --> 00:18:23,289
going to resolve the situation so that

00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:25,809
you can minimize damage before we find

00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:27,730
the offender drink next break and ask

00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:30,489
them discreetly to join two of us in a

00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:33,249
private room we found that too is an

00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:35,649
ideal number you need a bit more than

00:18:33,249 --> 00:18:38,679
one person sitting in but more than two

00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:40,659
is just too intimidating so we're

00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:42,369
meeting with the person and the first

00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:44,259
thing we do is that we explain them that

00:18:42,369 --> 00:18:46,539
we had a report and what was reported

00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:49,359
and then we ask them for their own point

00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:51,519
of view it's very important to give both

00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:53,440
sides a chance to explain their point of

00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:55,600
view you have to be neutral in a sense

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,289
of letting everyone explain the point of

00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:01,809
view it's also important to explain how

00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:03,759
and why what happened is a violation of

00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:06,809
the code of conduct it's part of letting

00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:09,100
the person improve so in our case we

00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:10,539
explained them what happened and we

00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,450
inform them that it's a violation of the

00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:14,510
code of conduct and

00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:17,120
ask them that did you eat the fruit we

00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:19,730
got everything again to import them of

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,760
the album of the talk and and we check

00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:24,710
that the tweet was indeed deleted and

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:28,610
it's important to make final decision as

00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:29,809
a team and keep everyone in the loop so

00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:31,850
one person on the response team

00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:33,529
immediately starts writing an incident

00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:35,450
report that's the document where they

00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:37,700
establish a timeline or what happened as

00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:39,559
detailed as possible it lists the facts

00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,919
what we know exactly what happened and

00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:44,389
also is the people involved in story

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,580
writing the report immediately here is

00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:47,960
really really key because the more tango

00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,360
pass you always think you will have time

00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,490
later but you probably want and also you

00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,840
tend to forget things maybe you won't be

00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,279
able to take screenshots later on so

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,029
it's very key that you act on this

00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:01,880
immediately finally we sent an email to

00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:03,350
report a reporter explaining the actions

00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,260
we've taken and thanking them for

00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:08,299
reporting again this establishes a paper

00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,370
trail and let reporter know that we

00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:12,889
actually took the action and those trust

00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:15,080
we also send an email to the offender

00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:17,149
repeating out some of the clock and we

00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,130
let them know that the case is closed so

00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:20,779
the cliff the case is closed from the

00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:22,940
offender's point of view but for us as

00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:24,950
organizers as a response team there's

00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:26,330
still a couple things we need to do one

00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:28,340
of them is that will forward the

00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,929
incident report to the code of conduct

00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:34,010
the general code of conduct committee

00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:37,669
and we also later after the conference

00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:38,899
publish a transparency report where we

00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,580
list all the events that happen during

00:20:38,899 --> 00:20:42,260
the conference and how we resolve them

00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:44,570
but this list is completely anonymized

00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,980
the first step affording the instance

00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:48,350
report to the general code of conduct

00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,059
committee is a way to have a kind of

00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:53,929
long-term memory of events of what

00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:55,399
happens it helps build track repeated

00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:57,980
events that may happen over several

00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:59,510
years over several conferences and the

00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:01,580
second step of having the transparency

00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:03,919
report is something that we do to

00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:05,299
demystify the code of conduct process to

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,070
show exactly what happened so that

00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:08,779
people know things actually happen but

00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,309
also show how we respond to them and see

00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:12,440
that sometimes it probably not a big

00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:15,289
deal and this really helps again build

00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,059
some trust with the community at this

00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:18,799
point for us as well we consider the

00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:20,740
case closed and we move on to the next

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,990
event

00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:25,570
see is like so many steps for a very

00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,970
small thing and the thing is in real

00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:30,820
life things can be more complex than

00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:33,490
that the example here was very

00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:35,650
straightforward the offender if identity

00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:37,990
was known and the person was cooperative

00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:41,620
the damn it was minimized by deleting

00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:43,950
the tweet but things would go much more

00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:46,210
complicated very very easily and

00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:48,100
response team needs to make a call on

00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:50,320
this bolt and sometimes judge what are

00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,570
the best actions to take and when

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,660
dealing with code of compact issues you

00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:57,100
have to be prepared to improvise but

00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,990
every time you improvise there is always

00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:02,380
something that needs to be your top

00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:03,850
priority is your attendees safety you

00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:06,070
have to know things in advance like

00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:08,650
maybe emergency numbers for your local

00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:10,570
area or make sure that there is security

00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:12,490
staff at your venue that can expel

00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:14,410
people if you need if you need to most

00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:16,300
likely you won't need that but being

00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:17,679
prepared in advance just makes it so

00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:20,050
that when something happens that you

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,940
didn't plan which will happen then it

00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,740
just really lowers the stress and lowers

00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:27,490
the amount of energy you need to spend

00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:30,220
just respond to this so we've seen with

00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:32,830
this process how you can implement a

00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:35,080
code of conduct in practice but I won't

00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,000
stress that it's important to keep in

00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,940
mind that the code of conduct it's not

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,970
there for its own sake it's not a to lot

00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:46,179
of punishment or enforcing some vague

00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:48,790
values that we have for us as organizers

00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:50,650
and as community members a code of

00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:54,179
conduct is one more tool in a tool belt

00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:57,429
that lets us create more inclusive

00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:58,960
events and more welcome in advance but

00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:01,210
it's not the only tool you have many

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,760
tools like making sure your value is

00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:06,850
accessible having free childcare for

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:09,130
speakers attendees having gender-neutral

00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,809
restrooms or food that caters to

00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:13,570
everyone's diets you have many many

00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:15,670
other tools so we see the code of

00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:17,380
conduct is now a standard thing in our

00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:20,620
community and we've shown you the

00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:23,050
examples that it is hard to get it right

00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:27,730
and we realized that the hardest and

00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:29,169
most stressful thing for us is in the

00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:31,900
whole process is when we need to

00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:34,590
improvise and we don't know what's the

00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:37,049
next step and this is why we started

00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:39,750
document our process into a step-by-step

00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:42,510
manual that takes out a lot of

00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:45,360
improvisation and guesswork it also

00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:47,880
takes take some of the emotional factor

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,100
out of the equation and we are proud to

00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:53,100
announce that we are really seeing our

00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,690
notes and our process online so the

00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,520
whole jungle community and not only

00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:59,549
general community can use and improve

00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:02,279
them and it is don't work with policy

00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:04,770
telescope minutes sitting there and you

00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:07,679
should go and follow her if you don't do

00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:10,260
that yet so this handbook it's a

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,970
collection of practical steps that you

00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:14,940
can take to improve your code of conduct

00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:16,350
process it shows the process a bit like

00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,630
we did before but much much more

00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:21,179
in-depth it talks about some of the do's

00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:23,039
and don'ts and it also has some things

00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:24,840
like templates for emails and reports

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,570
the teacher you can just reuse and feel

00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,429
as you need the repository is very new

00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,870
it's still quite working progress but we

00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:33,960
think it's already good enough for

00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:36,360
public consumption we also really really

00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,179
interested in getting feedback homes and

00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,740
hear the ideas of the community and take

00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:43,409
poll requests for anyone who wants to

00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:45,000
improve and fill the other Springs will

00:24:43,409 --> 00:24:48,600
also be there as well and so if you're

00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,149
interested you can come talk to us I see

00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,700
we're kind of over time so let's let's

00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:55,529
recap and we've shown you a bit of a

00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,899
history of Django community implemented

00:24:55,529 --> 00:25:00,809
code of conduct and we also show you the

00:24:57,899 --> 00:25:03,419
mistakes we've made when we serve as in

00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:06,570
various response teams and how hard is

00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:09,899
to remember about everything and if you

00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:12,149
don't have step-by-step instructions and

00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:13,620
we show you what happens practically

00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:16,020
when you will receive a report and what

00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:18,210
steps to take to resolve it so this is

00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:20,520
our formal process that we're trying to

00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:22,640
stick to and document so that it could

00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:27,120
be reused by other communities out there

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:29,130
and we do all work in the open because

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,710
we believe that code of conduct is not

00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:33,630
only a problem of a response team it's

00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:35,880
also not a problem of conference

00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:39,210
organizers and it's not only a problem

00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:41,850
of DSF or psf and it's a problem of

00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:44,700
community as a whole and building safe

00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:47,910
and welcoming and environment is

00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:50,310
really hard task and even though we

00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:52,200
don't know yet how to do it right with

00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:54,540
constant to try to push the limits and

00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,330
set higher and better standards every

00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:59,190
single year and we want to believe that

00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:02,070
drummer community will never stop

00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:04,730
pursuing being an inclusive and awesome

00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:07,730
community we are so proud to be part of

00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,730
thank

00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,680
