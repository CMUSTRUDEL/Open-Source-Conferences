	Atomic Wagtail by Kurt Wall

WHAT IS WAGTAIL

Wagtail is a Django-based CMS made by developers that were just sick of the current solutions out there for reasons from usability to extensibility. It provides a sleek and intuitive editing experience, while keeping its design open and flexible for creating custom frameworks. I'll first explain what Wagtail is, how we can use it, what features make it great, and what makes it not so great.

ATOMIC DESIGN

Brad Frost coined this term in reference to his taxonomical design model. The model breaks down design layouts from the simplest element to the more complex layouts. I'll briefly go over what this model is.

ATOMIC WAGTAIL

Atomic design lends well to the strengths and some features of Wagtail. I'll tell you how you can use Atomic design in harmony with Wagtail, with tips and pitfalls you might encounter along the way.

LESSONS LEARNED

Any new approach to something is going to be both fun and frustrating. I'll list some of the most frustrating aspects of Wagtail, trickled with some advice.

thanks for coming to listen to me

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,939
talking you know the state is stickier

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,699
for the you know the end of the all the

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,949
talks and thanks to you know torch box

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,990
for making wag so it's a wonderful piece

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:32,130
of technology and it's the reason why

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:34,800
I'm standing here so show of hands who

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,649
knows electors other than what I just

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,079
said okay that's great that's actually a

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,690
lot more than I thought would be so for

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,250
those of you that don't know

00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:48,570
wagtail is a pretty new open-source

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:50,730
Django CMS created by George box and it

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,739
basically provides this sort of

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,230
groundwork to build your own CMS and

00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,059
that's in quotes because it gives you a

00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,800
lot of things that I've seen that that

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:04,110
you would expect from a regular CMS

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:07,430
things like a like a great admin or the

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:10,560
ability to have a publishing system

00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:13,799
really anything like a way to manage

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,509
documents images things like that but I

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,710
like to think of laakso is something

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,470
that's made for the developer designer

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:22,290
and the continent there's a lot of CMS's

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:25,170
out there that really only focus on the

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,689
either like the development side or on

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,189
like the editing sign but I find that

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:30,869
well there's a really good job of

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,409
combining all these great components

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:35,970
that really should be relevant at CMS so

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,970
why should you use it it's really

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:41,939
customizable I've extended the framework

00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:44,460
well the the CMS on numerous occasions

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:48,000
is it doing weird things and it's really

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,009
like health fast it's really not a big

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,060
deal to really extend even some of the

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:57,479
most crucial components in fact my last

00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:00,180
project I had extended the publishing

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:02,009
workflow to add a staging site so

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,689
normally you'd have a draft state and

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,659
then it's on and then that's published

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:08,539
I've added a staging site to that entire

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,219
workflow and that didn't

00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:12,019
anything about the other components of

00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:13,609
wagtail there wasn't any near things I

00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:15,439
needed to take care of it was really

00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:16,700
easy in that way and it's got some

00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,829
really great features unfortunately I

00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,799
can't talk about all of them or even

00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:23,120
most of them actually there is another

00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:26,629
curve at this conference that talked

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,700
about Django forms in which you kind of

00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:30,200
think form I think about cams as data

00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,480
and in which you can build them

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,549
dynamically against a static way as we

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,260
would normally and write code those kind

00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:38,150
of use some of this and that's just kind

00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,060
of part of what they will wag so awkward

00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:42,560
so and you know I could go into it but

00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,480
there's a lot of great things after that

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,909
I have two offers and it gets out of

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,650
your way everybody always likes to talk

00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:50,480
about like developers are lazy right

00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,980
like we like we want everything done for

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,299
us we don't want to be we don't want to

00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,859
do anything we just want to like write

00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:56,329
import essay write like you want to

00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:58,579
write the thing we just want to be able

00:02:56,329 --> 00:03:00,919
to use it and I think that Waxhaw has

00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:02,810
this like I think I have a caveat right

00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:04,549
I think Weitzel does as well where it

00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,079
gets out of your way but then it

00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:08,540
provides all these features that you

00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:09,739
like so yeah we're lazy to wait wheel we

00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:14,090
want to be lazy they want it like doing

00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:16,280
things we also like we also want it to

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:20,720
like provide us with the things that we

00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,949
want to do so sorry we want it to get

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,090
out of her we wanted to get it out of

00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:27,590
the way and and just you know let us do

00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,859
what we want to do but also provide the

00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:33,799
features that we want it's also got you

00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:36,260
know jinda to compatible templating as

00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:37,669
well as Django normally you probably use

00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,819
Django unless you have some circle

00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:42,620
reason it's got built-in Lassiter in

00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:45,019
direct integration so there's a bit of

00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,329
setup that you have to do to achieve

00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:50,479
like a really good workflow or really

00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:52,489
good search capabilities with this but

00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,739
it's really not much in it and if you've

00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:56,270
never heard over user lots of search I

00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:59,030
definitely recommend it if

00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:02,930
really great really great surgeon in

00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:04,970
full it's more than that but it's easy

00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,010
to integrate an existing projects it's

00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,870
not really something that works on top

00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,880
of Django and more about on plight

00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,470
beside it so you put it in your

00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,440
installed apps and they're able to

00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:18,530
create a if you crave your own sort of

00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,540
CMS and I'll explain how you can create

00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:23,450
ways to create content types

00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:25,970
later and it's not gonna interfere with

00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:27,620
any of your other Django laps and you

00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,330
could really only have a blog that's

00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,720
powered by wack so you don't have to

00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:34,760
have a one project that has to be

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,090
powered by wagtail it's not like that at

00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,000
all

00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,500
and then what's Django be Django and

00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,870
this is like a really important thing I

00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:45,530
think in the mezzanine talk that he had

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:48,860
mentioned this too and I think I haven't

00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:50,870
had so much experience with mezzanine

00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:55,280
but I found that wax Hill does this

00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:57,800
business very well so some caveats to

00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,620
how great this you know how great wax

00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,380
will is it's not exactly your normal

00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:06,230
Django flow in terms of how hue which is

00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:08,210
a bit of contradictory I realized in the

00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,880
way that you think about how things get

00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:12,700
served right so you think of the way

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,680
that a request comes in it goes through

00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,180
the normal path and you end up this

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:21,020
views up high where you're where you're

00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:22,430
returning this result and I don't know

00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,410
if this is a bad thing or a good thing I

00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:28,220
think it's pretty good where they have

00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:31,010
this this generic view function in which

00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:36,140
it calls the the class in which you've

00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:39,530
created to render to the to surrender as

00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:41,630
the web page and it gets the context and

00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,700
packages all up and then through that

00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:46,490
generic served function that view

00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,690
function it will give you that it'll

00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,270
give you that webpage so you don't have

00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,169
to do anything you could have an entire

00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,540
Django or you could have an entire

00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:54,010
wagtail project entire site without ever

00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:58,210
touch

00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:59,620
and also the document documentation is

00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:02,680
pretty good but it could be a lot better

00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,300
I find myself like coming across things

00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,190
there at least when I started it that

00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,990
were fairly easy to understand but I

00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:10,240
didn't know and I took a long time

00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,710
actually gets that understanding just

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,480
because it wasn't in the documentation

00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:16,270
and then there are a couple admin works

00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:20,770
but I keep really good things about them

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:23,290
being that so let's just talk about some

00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:25,000
features real quick so the page model

00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,640
which is basically the bread and butter

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,780
of how this is gonna work and like I

00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,670
said before it's got this built-in

00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,450
publishing workflow and I guess I should

00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:34,600
back up a little bit

00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:36,850
page model it is a django model they had

00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,920
a bunch of really awesome functionality

00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:42,610
to it and then when you want to create

00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,720
your content type it is something that

00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,000
you would hear for parades which you can

00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,950
see in code it handles all the

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,310
relationships between different pages so

00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:52,750
it's like a child page of a parent page

00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,190
or you can like get the children on this

00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,900
page you can get the ancestors of the

00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,980
descendants it's really useful feature

00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,170
and that's actually something they

00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,550
achieved through a different package

00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:03,010
called Treebeard I don't really know

00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,350
what the relation is with that but you

00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:06,730
can look into that on your own so it

00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,410
handles other things like moving the

00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:10,440
relationship from one parent page to the

00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,250
other copying the page scheduling

00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,110
publishing so you're not having your

00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:17,650
content editors wake up at midnight just

00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:19,360
to publish some press release and and

00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,580
it's got automatic blacks I live in

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,800
registration and I just want to

00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,390
underline wax Aladdin because it's not

00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:29,110
something that you're automatically

00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:32,800
registering and your Django admin but

00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:35,590
anyway so this is like an example of all

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,720
you need to create a page type a content

00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:39,820
type that you could add to your site and

00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,100
visit as a web page so you would go and

00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,300
you would in your models up high or

00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,250
wherever you're going to put this model

00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:48,100
and hair it from page and then you can

00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:50,200
add even a dangle model field a date

00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,340
field and then their own built in rich

00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,490
text field which is really just a

00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,620
WYSIWYG editor and then in order to show

00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,330
these in the

00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:01,710
will view that you're going to see

00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:03,540
you're just going to declare these

00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,190
content panels which is just a list of

00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,800
these fuel panels and it'll go in and

00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:11,900
detect what type of field that you're

00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:14,850
using and then render that appropriately

00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:16,889
so stream field was really the big win

00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,150
in my opinion I think this was one of

00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:23,490
the thing that most attracted me to

00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:25,050
wagtail and it's to me I just dislike I

00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,120
don't work for torch box by the way I

00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,070
just really love street dealing really

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,690
like I really really like wagtail and I

00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:32,940
think it's creative intuitive everything

00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:35,339
I say up there and Mac Matthew West guy

00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,200
is written a really cool blog post that

00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:40,800
kind of harps on this or like comes off

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,510
with this theme of of the Henri for Sam

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,060
think of their presence is that quote

00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:46,920
but he says something like if I asked

00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,380
them what they wanted they say faster

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,700
horses and now we've got cars so this is

00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,400
the type of thing that we're talking

00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,110
about when when I say Richfield rich

00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,060
text field or WYSIWYG replacement

00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,670
instead of that instead of this blob of

00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:03,000
HTML we're working with JSON and in

00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:04,500
order to to create this JSON objects

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,080
we're gonna be implementing these things

00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,510
called blocks which is a class that that

00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:13,700
manages all this data that creates it in

00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:17,160
the that just just creates like this

00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:20,550
nice structured block of content within

00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,260
this stream field and stream field if

00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,790
it's a little bit confusing and I'll

00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,250
dive more into it

00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:29,190
it is really just a text field state in

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:32,040
the database so instead of again this

00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:34,410
like completely like it could be

00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,900
completely unknown to what's in this

00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,520
blob of HTML now we know exactly how to

00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,500
access all of these individual

00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:43,290
components because it's all formatted

00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,209
JSON and so this would be an example of

00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,310
a blog which I referred to earlier

00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:51,029
something that could manage that that

00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:52,320
JSON content and really we're hearing

00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:54,570
from a couple of things but really to

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,770
understand is that blog site struct

00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,270
block which is what we're inheriting

00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:59,790
from here is just a way to combine

00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,780
different blocks right and block you can

00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,880
think it was kind of like a

00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,350
feel like a model field even though it's

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,480
not something that's actually getting it

00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,770
directly saved to the database the only

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,840
thing that saved the database is that

00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:11,370
text field when you're declaring string

00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,410
field and you can see that we've done

00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:17,220
other things here too like in the middle

00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:20,340
class we've done things like icon equals

00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:23,640
wagtail and sample and equals example

00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:25,200
blog to HTML and that's how it's going

00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,520
to be used or that's how you're going to

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,290
see it in the end and that's how it's

00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,600
going to be rendered in the front end

00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:34,050
and what will puck will explain more

00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,370
about that so on the actual page this is

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,670
what stream feel is going to look like

00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:40,710
you've got your screen field which again

00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:43,230
is just that text field just format a

00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:46,590
JSON and you pass an argument of a list

00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:48,450
of tuples and each tuple has the string

00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:50,460
of which is the type of block that you

00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,930
were working with and then the actual

00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:55,110
block class and which is going to be

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:57,120
manipulating that data and so in order

00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,440
to really demonstrate it and I know it

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,510
might be harping on it too much but I

00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:10,560
really it took me a while to understand

00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:12,090
this my passwords fubar so so so here

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,260
this is the wexel admin and you can

00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,880
already kind of tell that this is

00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,460
something that's derivative from other

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,990
CMS's that you've seen but to me it

00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,210
looks a lot better it looks a lot more

00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,160
streamlined and here are some other

00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:25,620
features that I couldn't talk about the

00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,660
things like images documents this is

00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,240
where you could go to look and search

00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,830
for these things here's a search for all

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,310
the different pages and content types

00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:36,270
that you want snippets are really just

00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:38,460
models that you can register in the

00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:40,230
admin and then we've got settings so

00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,790
we've got really good like controls for

00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,880
like adding users adding groups of users

00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:47,760
getting permissions on those groups and

00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,320
and setting up redirects and different

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,460
cool stuff like that and then what's

00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,260
really nice and it's something that

00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:55,350
people use all the time really is this

00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,550
Explorer where it actually has a page I

00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,890
don't have anything in this and by the

00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,630
way this is a wack self demo from there

00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:02,210
there this is their demo

00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,590
I haven't made any of this code at all

00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:06,360
this nope he's actually mapping so

00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:08,190
anything that I'm showing you in code on

00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,780
the presentation so because I kind of

00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:12,900
wanted to show everybody that that does

00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:14,550
exist so we can go to this root page and

00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,500
then we can go to this atomic grab tail

00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:19,590
page that I've created and we can see

00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,510
that I already have content here but

00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:23,010
this is the string field and this is

00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:26,940
what's going to look like in the admin

00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:29,790
and so you can tell that we've got how

00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:32,340
these icons like how the icon maeda like

00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:34,920
a dream comes in that's the I think it's

00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,390
like heading icon and we've got all

00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,030
these different blocks that we can block

00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:41,430
types that we can selects right and and

00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:43,500
this is great right like this is exactly

00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,750
something that we want you know we want

00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,780
to be able to have a heading here and

00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:51,840
then just say heading why don't heading

00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:54,080
and and then we can have like even rich

00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,070
text field and you know sometimes that's

00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,450
sometimes that's appropriate because

00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:00,000
sometimes we want to put in a link or

00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:01,650
something like that I'm not gonna put in

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,030
the links all right and then we can also

00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:08,220
do things like preview the page and then

00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:12,990
this content shows up and you might be

00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:15,000
wondering and I'll explain later why why

00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:18,090
it didn't just show up as just text

00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,860
right because and it's really because of

00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:22,230
that template but I'll explain a little

00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,540
bit more yeah right here actually so

00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:27,510
straight field you can think about this

00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:30,540
and if we if we kind of know that 20

00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:33,900
field exists on that page model as a as

00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:35,220
a as a just a JSON formatted text we can

00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,980
think of each one of these blocks as

00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,840
different types and see is before B is

00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,420
before a so every time you're going to

00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,790
be rendering each JSON object it's it's

00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,290
it's in an order right and these things

00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:49,410
are orderable too so you can actually

00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:51,030
move the different blocks if you want so

00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,380
let's just say C is a person block that

00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,270
has a name a date of birth and a

00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:58,470
biography biography could just be

00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:59,940
something like a rich text block but but

00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,980
instead maybe we want to be something

00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,870
else too we want to put in a heading and

00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,810
then the body is is the rich text block

00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,400
and then we had it ended

00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:09,520
that person's like headshot or something

00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:12,070
like that and really this is just a

00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:14,020
really simplified page but what what is

00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:17,200
really important here is just this

00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:20,170
you're just accessing each block as a

00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,430
collection on this page top body which

00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,400
is a stream field and then just

00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:26,410
rendering that block right and what's

00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:29,230
what and really that's that's all you

00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:31,180
really need and sure you can do really

00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:33,580
custom things like accessing the block

00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:35,260
block type which will give you that

00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,270
screen that you gave as an argument in

00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:40,450
the beginning and that tuple so you can

00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:41,950
render it in a certain way given certain

00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:45,220
conditions or whatever you want to do

00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:47,230
and so what's really happening here is

00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,460
that this person block made up of all

00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:50,740
these different other blocks

00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,910
it's calling this render method and this

00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:56,050
is somewhat of an oversimplification

00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:58,360
here and this isn't exactly code that

00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:02,380
you might use but then you have this

00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:08,260
person to HTML template that you're

00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:10,839
declaring in that block class so so once

00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:13,660
it gets to value dot biography it will

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,339
then called biographies render value

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,140
right or a render function which will do

00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:18,130
the same exact thing so what's really

00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:22,180
great here is that you're able to

00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:24,610
actually modularize oh the entirety of

00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:30,580
your content instead of just having this

00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:32,470
blip big blob of HTML so just to step

00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:36,420
back do something else for a little bit

00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:40,000
what's what does anybody actually ever

00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:41,500
combine documentation or have some sort

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,750
of workflow with their designers in

00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,760
which they were actually mapping their

00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:49,680
designs on the website that you're

00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:51,990
building for them with back-end code

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:57,760
nobody nobody does that

00:15:51,990 --> 00:16:00,450
ok cool so atomic design was thought out

00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:03,079
by Brad Frost

00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:05,670
and this link on preachers to the

00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:07,170
article that he wrote on this it's a

00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:08,370
whole book it's Nebo you can download it

00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:10,769
you buy it you can just read it online

00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:12,269
but essentially it's just a philosophy

00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:14,040
or just a way of thinking about how we

00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:16,440
can combine different modules and design

00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,420
on your site into really consumable

00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,070
pieces and so I'm gonna go over this

00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,740
really quickly I'm not a designer I'm

00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:25,529
just trying to you know explain how we

00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,959
can integrate this so really five levels

00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:29,700
atoms molecules organisms temples and

00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:33,120
pages I realized that this isn't exactly

00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:37,529
a great analogy with you know biology

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:40,320
and then templates and things but but

00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:43,110
this is kind of how they've created that

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:47,339
and so an atom would be something simple

00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:48,959
something like a a like a button or

00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:53,700
maybe even just a headed and then

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:56,190
molecules are a like a combination of

00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,320
atoms organisms are a combination of

00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:00,360
maybe molecules maybe multiple molecules

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,250
maybe maybe molecules and then atoms

00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,370
however you want to define that within

00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:09,030
your own reasoning sort of like

00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:10,919
guidelines by Brad Frost's atomic design

00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:12,240
and then templates would be just

00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:13,410
everything together you can think of it

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,970
as just your Django template or

00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:16,260
something and then page is something

00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,299
that you have all the content that

00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:21,270
that's just a really brief overview a

00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:24,179
really oversimplification a really

00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:28,079
oversimplified version of what a atomic

00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:29,490
design is so when you're using whack so

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,960
with atomic design which is something

00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:35,730
that I've been working with for the past

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:37,950
like year is is you're going to map all

00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:40,230
of these blocks these Springfield blocks

00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:42,030
that I've told you about to your atoms

00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,890
or molecules your organisms and that

00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:45,990
you're gonna combine that in your page

00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:49,410
type to be able to render all of your

00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:52,049
different components consistently so

00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:53,070
your design is continuously pervasive

00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:55,440
through everything that you're going to

00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:57,360
be developing with so this is like an

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,919
example of atoms by where you have your

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,049
heading and then just inherits from char

00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:01,450
block it uses the title icon and then

00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:03,399
you

00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,570
the template Adams heading dilation no

00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:08,260
it could be something as simple as just

00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:09,610
using that you know h1 tag or it could

00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,049
have extra classes that you want to put

00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,760
on there it just all depends on your use

00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:14,380
case and then we have same thing for

00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,029
hyperlink that may be a little bit more

00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,649
complicated because you've got could

00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:20,649
have different markup for external links

00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:22,870
or whatnot and then we just do the same

00:18:20,649 --> 00:18:25,570
thing with molecules but again since all

00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,230
atoms can be inside molecules and so on

00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,490
and so forth

00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,260
we're going to just reuse these

00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:31,299
components so every time you use a

00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,320
headache you're going to where every

00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:33,850
time you want to put a heading somewhere

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,279
you're going to reuse that in your

00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,510
molecules and so like you don't have to

00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:39,340
worry it like you don't worry about

00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:42,639
multiple changes or like anything like

00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:45,220
that like in random here in this page we

00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:47,110
have this blob of HTML where we have to

00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,630
change this h1 at a way we have to go

00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:51,279
over here and change this h1 it's all

00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,870
going to be changed right there it's all

00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:55,419
just rendered exactly the way you want

00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:59,740
it and and it's also only gonna be

00:18:55,419 --> 00:19:01,870
rendered on whenever that on run time so

00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:04,330
that even that even if it's the same

00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:05,620
heading content you're still going to

00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,450
get that change whenever you want to

00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:10,480
make that and so we do the same thing

00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:12,250
with organisms we have scenes before and

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,659
then we have a screen field where we

00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,720
have we've combined all of this together

00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:22,200
and so again you've got this really

00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:24,700
continuous this pervasive design

00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,519
specification in our code and not only

00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:30,909
just that that consistency but we also

00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:32,799
have a mapping between our designs where

00:19:30,909 --> 00:19:34,240
they have tons of documentation because

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,130
the designers love documenting and they

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,480
love like understanding exactly how

00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:39,730
these components interact with each

00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,380
other and we're just have in these

00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,789
different actions and then we can say

00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,350
like oh that's the exact component in

00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:46,450
the backend that does that and that's

00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,529
something I've never seen before so this

00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,330
is like a really cool way to actually

00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:51,490
organize all these things and it makes

00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:53,260
ramp up time for like new fellows or

00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:57,010
like new whoever to be able to

00:19:53,260 --> 00:20:00,000
understand like which max - what and so

00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:02,980
this is just some sort of you know

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,260
projects file structure set that I did

00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,750
and essentially what my project is like

00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:09,290
as I put these in this elements folder I

00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:12,410
put all of my atoms molecule

00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:13,850
and then in my models down here I'm

00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:16,490
going to be putting all my page types

00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:18,800
and I have and actually in my project I

00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:20,390
have models folder and which I have all

00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:26,150
the different page pages that I've

00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:28,250
created in that folder so a couple more

00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:29,930
thoughts you know act I was like really

00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:32,060
cool it has that awesome string field

00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:34,370
feature of amongst many other features

00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,470
and it's something that I've always

00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:38,960
heard from other people like continent

00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:41,120
or really anybody that it's just such a

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,210
joy to use it's a great replacement for

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:47,900
something that is really unusable like

00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:50,330
not really intuitive we replace it with

00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:52,160
we replace work for us with wagtail and

00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:53,450
our continent were just you know jumping

00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,670
with joy almost I mean they were really

00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:57,170
really excited about it and that if

00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,310
you're gonna made with wax board you can

00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:00,620
see all the different websites that

00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:02,240
wagtails like that's why powering

00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,810
there's I think there's a parts of like

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,370
NASA

00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:06,920
there's compute consumerfinance.gov

00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:09,500
which is the cfpb site there's Peace

00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,000
Corps so it's not just some you know

00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,200
brand new no one's ever used a

00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,380
technology this is actually pretty

00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,030
proven so I definitely encourage you to

00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,250
go and at least try it out see what

00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:20,780
these features are like and see if maybe

00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:23,030
you know you can incorporate a psalm

00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:25,990
design in your and your workflow so

00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,990
that's it thanks

00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:35,950
oh thank you good we've got a few

00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:39,100
minutes for questions so my question

00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:41,769
concerns image versioning and multimedia

00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:45,700
aspect versioning is there any facility

00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:49,419
to version images and assets so that

00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:51,669
they can be sort of identified as unique

00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:56,860
elements and then updated on their own

00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:58,869
affecting all pages that's actually an

00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:01,419
interesting question I don't think I

00:21:58,869 --> 00:22:03,610
know enough about exactly how these

00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:05,769
images are being you know like

00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:07,330
essentially each image itself or

00:22:05,769 --> 00:22:09,100
document or whatever has its own idea in

00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:10,749
a database so if you update that idea

00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,980
it's gonna be changed throughout the

00:22:10,749 --> 00:22:15,220
whole thing I don't know about

00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,539
versioning that's there is such a thing

00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,369
in black so which is actually one of the

00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:20,289
greatest things about it that I'm sorry

00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:22,059
I didn't even mention is really just the

00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:24,669
versioning of the pages so every time

00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:26,799
you saved data on that or every time you

00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:28,179
save a page that gets saved as a

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,399
revision object so you could reference

00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:32,860
that object that is it something that

00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:34,720
images have I don't know if that

00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:37,509
terribly answered your question it does

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,860
okay and I have another question but I'm

00:22:37,509 --> 00:22:45,330
gonna defer and ask it later

00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:45,330
okay one more question

00:22:53,249 --> 00:22:57,940
yeah so my question is is basically

00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:00,789
concerning like say you have an existing

00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,320
site that has user profile you know like

00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:06,129
every user profile page or something

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,749
like that and so I guess this is around

00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:12,730
integration so and you want to integrate

00:23:07,749 --> 00:23:15,940
wagtail into the site is it possible and

00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:18,460
if so how hard is it would it be to

00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:20,679
basically make it so the wagtail

00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,850
articles say you're one of them's an

00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:23,379
author or something you would show that

00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:24,940
user profile information from an

00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:27,490
existing site you know does it integrate

00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:29,919
well with models that exist already yeah

00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:31,040
it already uses a bat-pole models

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,900
table and everything

00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,180
that's gonna automatically get there

00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,530
when you're going to be at wags 11 you

00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,480
go to the users and it's just going to

00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:42,050
be there oh that's my experience you

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,570
know there yeah ok and how does the how

00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:47,180
does the code actually like hook up you

00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:49,370
know so like say you've got you know

00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:52,100
does it just use to get absolute URL for

00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:53,480
instance if it links to their profile or

00:23:52,100 --> 00:24:00,230
is that there's a some you customize

00:23:53,480 --> 00:24:02,030
yourself I'm sorry I don't think my

00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:04,250
answer is entirely corrected I use the

00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,900
profile I don't know about that Oh God

00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:08,180
I think the users themselves are gonna

00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:10,010
be connected I'm not I haven't had

00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,590
experience with connecting the user

00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:18,260
profiles okay sorry

00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:19,730
oh no problem yeah thank you first of

00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:22,540
all Thank You Kurt for your amazing talk

00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:22,540
