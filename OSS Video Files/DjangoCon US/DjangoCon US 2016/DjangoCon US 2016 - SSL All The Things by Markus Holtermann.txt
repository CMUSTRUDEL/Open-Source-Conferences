	DjangoCon US 2016 - SSL All The Things by Markus Holtermann

Over the last few years SSL/TLS encryption of not only websites but many other services as well has risen tremendously. The Let’s Encrypt organization and certificate authority (CA) makes that pretty easy. Since September 2015 almost 1.8 million certificates have been issued. And you can use it, too. For free!

In this talk I'll demonstrate how to integrate SSL/TLS and point out some common pitfalls. I’ll briefly layout the Let's Encrypt ACME protocol and explain what you need to set up in Django to make SSL/TLS the default and only way to access your site.
