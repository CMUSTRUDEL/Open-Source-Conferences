Description: 
	Git in Control, Version Control and How it Could save Your Life by Rachell Calhoun

“You can’t break GitHub, don’t worry.” Maybe you can’t break it but you can sure get yourself into a labyrinth of git commands. Version control can be a headache but it can also save your project.

There are certain pitfalls to avoid when using Git, I’ve probably found most of them and stumbled my way out. While my goal is to help you avoid them altogether, I also want to give you the skills to work through these pitfalls so you can make it out alive and with your project intact.

Whether you’re working on your own project, or collaborating with others you can learn how to git survive anything. We’ll discuss the benefits version control has for your own projects as well as projects with others.

For all of you awesome collaborators working with others on a project, we’ll go over important steps to take while handling others’ code and ‘gitiquette’ so you can save yourself the embarrassment of faux pas in the git world.

My goal is to give you an overview of Github flow, provide solutions for potential problems you may encounter, and help you feel more comfortable with version control.

and how it can save your life and I am

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:33,090

and I'll get into that a little bit but

00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:42,540

I don't judge you okay let's get started

00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:49,129
alright so this is a basic outline so

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,359
you know we're gonna be talking about

00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:55,410
first we'll do the who I'm Who am I

00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:57,539
version control setting up get so basic

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,269
commands and then we'll get into the fun

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,160
tricky stuff that also often time tricks

00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:05,580
up people and then get a kit you get

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:09,960
etiquette alright so before we dive in

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:12,330
Who am I but since I'm a little bit

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,540
rebellious I don't want to do a mi I

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:18,649
want to do a git config so you can fake

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:23,070
global user name Rachel Calhoun mm-hmm

00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:28,320
and yes that's Rachel at 12 my mom she

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:31,229
likes um alright so this is my

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:36,030
background I studied Spanish and France

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:38,729
a final essay in University um I after I

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,770
graduated I wanted to travel and learn

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:43,740
languages and so i combined the two I

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:46,770
went to Korea to teach English for nine

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:49,950
years 9 years i have to study come along

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,289
I study Korean and while I was teaching

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,200
English I thought about the future and I

00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:57,689
want to change careers so I started with

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,570
Python and I found a local study group

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:02,130
we worked on Python you did a lot of fun

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,710
things for about a year then we get into

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:08,550
Django and we discover jingle girls we

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:11,490
also made jangle girls workshop in Seoul

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:14,340
we have an also community there and from

00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:16,130
that I'm here and along the way those

00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,630
two and a half years I discovered I

00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:21,210
learned a lot of things the hard way so

00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,740
I'm hoping to tell you how to do it the

00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,380
easy way and give you some emergency

00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,460
exits or sort of survival strategies so

00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,330
you don't throw the computer out the

00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,230
window okay alright so now that we've

00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,500
done that we're going to go on to number

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:37,920
two version control alright so the

00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,050
importance of version control it's good

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,380
to track record and recall different

00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:45,180
versions of your what files it can be

00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,750
cold it can be text and even these days

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,700
are doing a lot of art what is get get

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:54,060
one is more than 11 years old it was

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,830
created by the Credo linux also limits

00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,500
Torvald I hope I said that name right on

00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:02,250
the Linux community no longer could use

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:05,370
their revision control system so he

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,650
created it in a weekend if you think is

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,780
difficult after months of trying

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:13,170
employment out he made in a weekend

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:16,320
which is for y'all um so if you're

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:18,990
collaborating alone you can work it

00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,480
helps with editing reviewing and saving

00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:23,670
different projects they can make it very

00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,130
easy if you're on your soul project you

00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:29,730
can help you keep track of different

00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:31,650
changes you may I can also help you

00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:35,400
break the code you can go back to a

00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,960
different version um one thing I like to

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,910
do is it helps me work at different

00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,700
locations they find that work or if I'm

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:44,910
at home I can just put it on github or

00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:47,970
other services and keep continuing where

00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:50,130
I left off all right um and also if you

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,230
are on it if you're collaborating with

00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:55,590
others you have the same benefit but you

00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:57,330
can also see who did what with their

00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:02,450
skin blame which is awesome you can also

00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:02,450
work out things at the same time okay

00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:10,710
alright so next we're going to set up

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,600
kit okay before we kind of get a set up

00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,970
a little you know you'll see some good

00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,850
command for people that don't know those

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,680
who'll be put in your black box your

00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,739
command line

00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,789
terminal after the dollar sign and you

00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:24,949
want to make sure you're in the correct

00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:27,050
folder while you're doing that because

00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:28,970
that could cause some problems so when

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,039
ticket get set up first you want to make

00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,630
sure its installed if you're on linux it

00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:35,509
should be already you want to introduce

00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:38,120
yourself to get and so you'll want to do

00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:41,600
what get config global user name your

00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:45,530
name and then your email like this and

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,300
replace it with your information ok

00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:50,690
after that you'll want to start and how

00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:53,120
do we start getting it initiate you can

00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:56,300
go to the folder you want to start and

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,340
you do get kinect get in it sorry and

00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,259
after you initiate you want to connect

00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,830
it with your online repository so here's

00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:05,180
your computer and the cloud is unlike uh

00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,370
story that you want to send it to or

00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,410
connect it with so you have to do get

00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,620
remote at origin and then put the path

00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,630
to origin you can find this on the

00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:18,500
website that you created ok next you'll

00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:20,150
want to yeah you can also get clone so

00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,270
if there's already a project that you

00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:25,849
want to clone or copy duplicate you can

00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:29,630
do git clone path to the file name and

00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:31,699
here it's a heart so and that's in the

00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,979
cloud that's i'm online a remote

00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:36,590
repository so you'll want to do get

00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:39,349
clone path to heart i guess in this case

00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:42,349
right and now you have it and you can

00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:46,550
have fun with it oh my gosh that's fast

00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:48,020
i hope you saw that ok hit command um so

00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,550
now we're in it now we have it set up

00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,220
with your name now we're going to go to

00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,720
the command basic stuff that everyone

00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,630
needs to know when they're starting good

00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,430
ok get status and what does get status

00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,990
after your juice you should check it out

00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,699
how are you doing right you want to see

00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:05,840
what's changed what's new what you

00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:08,120
should do this is also great if you

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,830
don't know what you're doing because it

00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,729
doesn't change anything but it makes you

00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:13,620
look like you're doing something really

00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:15,780
important ok so you can always get

00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:20,220
and I do that sometimes hit by again I

00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:22,500
don't know a good okay but I thought

00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,180
about for checking the repository see

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,919
what you've added see any changes you've

00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:29,850
made or if you're not sure where you're

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:32,850
at it'll tell you that as well um on

00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:34,680
your local okay oh this fast is good at

00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:37,320
pointing out changes okay so let's see

00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,590
this is an example git status you can

00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,660
see where we are we're on branch name

00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:45,960
and you can see the on Trek file list of

00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,190
passwords and passwords to now if you

00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,410
don't know what to do with that you can

00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,690
see it says oh it's a hit like it at

00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,039
maybe we should do that but I don't know

00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:55,110
if you want to add your passwords but

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,780
you can if you want to and we'll get

00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:01,590
into that what's added it's not mad but

00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:04,139
um we'll see all right so what does get

00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:08,250
ad after you've made some changes to

00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:12,180
your files what you want to do is get ad

00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:13,800
and here it get ad path to file name so

00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,919
wherever your file is you want to let

00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,800
them know so we can find it and first

00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:22,139
you won't might want to check the status

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,210
to see your where you're at and what

00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:25,550
files are listed to add and then you can

00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,020
see the file name you can add it there

00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:30,360
and what adding does it adds it to the

00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:33,030
queue it added to the list I guess you

00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:37,380
could say of what then can be packaged

00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:39,690
labeled and sent later so you can see

00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:44,460
here the heart is in a queue waiting to

00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:47,760
be catching another way is get add file

00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:49,860
name okay so if you're currently in the

00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,860
same fires file at the folder you can do

00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:56,760
get add file name or get ad heart and

00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:58,380
now it's ready to be packaged and one

00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,680
left get add that I want to talk about

00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:03,419
is get at all this is useful if you have

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,820
a lot of things you've changed and

00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:09,060
you're ready to commit them all but it

00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:11,820
can be dangerous because like before if

00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:14,310
we have a list of passwords that can be

00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:17,250
added as well and not all of us want our

00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:20,310
passwords for the world to see okay so

00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,600
make sure if you to be careful and to

00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,960
not add things like

00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:27,690
passwords or to do list or random stuff

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,700
we can make a get ignore file and what

00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:32,340
is to get its dot get ignore the dot is

00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:35,099
important and you'll want to create it

00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:37,860
on your code editor and type in the file

00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:40,289
name that you want get to ignore so it

00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,630
won't add it when it doesn't get at all

00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:44,340
all right and so one more time i want to

00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,530
emphasize don't add important

00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,870
information sensitive information to get

00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:50,880
it can be difficult to get off you can't

00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:53,820
get it off there but anyway so get at

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,250
all and we have heart heart ping yay

00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,080
heart all right and so we added all

00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,330
those and now we're ready to package it

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,830
and this is the workflow I wanted to

00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,840
include this so you can visualize the

00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:06,480
process a little better we have get in

00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,940
it or clone and then get at so then

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:13,740
what's next after we have those files

00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:15,660
and cue we commit get commit after we're

00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,010
ready we commit them get it packages

00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,290
them all together so they're all in the

00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:21,030
package and then it labels it here the

00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:23,910
label with jingle girls because junior

00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:28,230
girls is awesome but it actually has a

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:31,650
really long reference ID that's a mix of

00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:33,690
letters and numbers so you can find it

00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:36,990
again later if you want to go back to

00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:39,240
that for any reason all right if nothing

00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,650
is added nothing will be committed you

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,750
can't send and you can't package

00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:46,260
something that doesn't exist all right

00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:49,200
so also one way I'm sorry way you can do

00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:51,210
git commit it'll open um a text editor

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,610
you have to enter a message what did you

00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:55,410
do what are you sending what did you

00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:58,110
change you should let them know if you

00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:00,660
want to do it in one line you can do get

00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:02,700
committed dash mne and your message here

00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,470
is I made some awesome changes now

00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,560
although this is a message a more

00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:10,980
descriptive message would be useful what

00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,930
did you change all right so now here we

00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,670
are in the workflow we initiated we

00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:17,460
added we committed and you can see here

00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:20,760
the commit has a label it's c14 commit

00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:26,180
one okay and now the pact is ready to go

00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:26,180
how do we send it it's get push okay

00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:31,830
so far we've been working on our

00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:34,260
computer after you made a commitment to

00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:37,170
follow through so how do you get those

00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:40,140
changes on github online how do you

00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:42,149
share them with the world get push sends

00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:45,060
or pushes information to the remote

00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:49,410
repository not on your computer and what

00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:52,770
you can do is get push origin master

00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:55,230
that pushes the master branch or if

00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:57,870
you're working on a different branch you

00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:00,149
can do get push origin branch name and

00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,970
that will push it from where you are to

00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:07,589
the remote repository so you can see

00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:11,010
here the workflow and so next to your

00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:14,010
like what master what branch yes we're

00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:15,899
going to get into what is a branch ok

00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:18,000
like a lot of people like to talk about

00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:19,350
branches when they talk about get so

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,810
here we're going to talk about branches

00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:24,779
to a branch is an independent line of

00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:26,550
development the original branch is

00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:28,920
called master by default but also that

00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:34,200
you can have different versions of the

00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:36,959
same file and this is what one French

00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,760
tree might look like and get so let's

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,400
say you have a big you're at work of a

00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,080
big project jump to finish this is a

00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,820
real life example okay and you want to

00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,920
watch this party but you can't do both

00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,230
the same time well if life was like it

00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:52,050
you could you could make a word branch

00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:54,060
and your work you can make a party

00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:57,270
branch and go have an awesome party and

00:11:54,060 --> 00:12:07,020
then you could we're just together and

00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:09,779
be better next let's talk about how to

00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:14,430
create branches right you can see here

00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:18,720
there's the master branch oh um so how

00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:21,029
do we get check out oh ok there there's

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,070
the word French sorry so we always work

00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:25,470
before play so here's the work branch I

00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:26,940
just creates it nothing has changed you

00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,950
just made it another version of the same

00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,420
thing all right and then if you want to

00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,520
delete it like wet say made a mistake

00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,320
you don't wanna get fired whatever you

00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:38,430
can delete it by get chicken

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:41,220
d okay so what if you do something

00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:43,470
awesome and you want to share that work

00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,210
and you want to show it off so after

00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,560
years of work branch and you made a few

00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:49,530
changes and you want to push it to

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,630
github so you can do get push origin

00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:57,450
work french and it just pushes that

00:12:51,630 --> 00:13:00,180
branch okay next get branch is very

00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:01,200
useful it's like it status if you don't

00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,430
know what you're doing it makes you look

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,650
like to do and it doesn't change

00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:06,990
anything it's just checking so this is

00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:09,210
an example of without but if you type

00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:11,190
get French header change different

00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,900
branches that I had made on my project

00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,480
that I was working on and which project

00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:19,770
or which branch of my currently on

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:22,920
anybody know yeah okay um all right

00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:24,870
let's go so branches we have a little

00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:30,120
bit of understanding next we're going to

00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:33,540
go 2011 anyone I'll do it could be get

00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:36,620
that yes very good little dogs and get

00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:40,140
there there is fetching all right so

00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:43,470
what is fetch we do get such origin

00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,820
fetches something where you collect the

00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:47,010
information that's on the remote

00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,750
repository so like on github you would

00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:51,720
collect it and it's just sitting there

00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,220
you didn't do anything with it yet so if

00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,500
you see this you're just copying

00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:59,990
information from there to your computer

00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:02,340
and then what can we do we merge it and

00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:03,930
merging is what you have to fetch it'll

00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:07,320
actually apply those changes or the

00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:09,840
updated files in here you can see we

00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,660
merged the work branch the master and

00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:16,560
party branch semester and both our work

00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:19,500
and party lights are happy right so

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,570
let's and also don't be alarmed if get

00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,280
tells you there's a conflict because

00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:25,740
sometimes and what is the conflict it

00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,870
needs to line the code are a little bit

00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,700
different and the same line so you have

00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:36,840
to tell git which one do you want to

00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:39,390
keep ok so then oh we can see it merged

00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:42,230
they're up there and master alright in a

00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:43,920
conflict so this if you look in your

00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:47,610
open your text editor

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,019
and you see where the conflict is it'll

00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:51,089
show you something like this and you

00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:52,860
need to choose which one you want to

00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:54,600
keep the original change or the modified

00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,209
change and just delete the one you don't

00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:01,440
want to go to add and so after you

00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:03,660
finish you edit you can then get add git

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:08,130
commit and push if that's what you want

00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:10,350
to do ok next we're go to get pull we've

00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:12,120
done pushing what is git pull get pull

00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,940
is git fetch and get merged in one

00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:17,880
command you can do get full and what

00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:22,620
does that do it hold it and merges or

00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:25,920
fetches a merger sorry ok but so next to

00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:27,899
how about forking if you can see the bar

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,110
unwatched are for theirs for what does

00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:33,360
that do this is the original repository

00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:37,949
and what it will do is make a copy in

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,870
your online repository oh we fork ok now

00:15:37,949 --> 00:15:43,980
we have a heart just like then hopefully

00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:46,139
everyone has a heart ok so then what we

00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:49,529
want to do is we want to get it on our

00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:52,350
local computer so how can we do that we

00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:57,570
clone from our branch from our online

00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:59,519
repository ok and then let's see so

00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:01,230
after creating the fork you can get

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,589
clone let me see and do it again sorry

00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:06,240
and then alright so once you're feeling

00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:08,220
comfortable you're like ok I guess it's

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,589
hard I want to make some changes I know

00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:13,800
basics what do I do ok so you make some

00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:16,019
awesome changes and now the heart is

00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,269
green and you want to send those to the

00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:20,640
original project and you think that will

00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:25,320
really benefit the project so what do

00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:27,060
you do you can do you get push and then

00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,069
once you do a good push if you go to

00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:32,579
github there's a green button us a

00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:35,550
compare and pull request and now that

00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:37,290
will check the to online class stories

00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:39,000
and now that's basically asking the

00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:41,699
owner of the other online across story

00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,250
do you want to accept my changes and if

00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:45,569
it there are three I guess they're more

00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,069
but there are three basic things that

00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:49,769
can happen they can deny you with no

00:16:47,069 --> 00:16:51,160
comment which is really not fun or they

00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:55,149
can comment with

00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,680
for changes um and if they do that what

00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:58,600
you can do is go back to your branch on

00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,940
your local computer and your local how

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,379
story make the changes and send them you

00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,480
don't have to do another pull request

00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:07,419
it'll all be in that one it'll update

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:13,929
while you push or the third thing you

00:17:07,419 --> 00:17:16,689
can do is get accepted yay good job your

00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:20,740
green heart is now added it's all

00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:24,459
celebrating how I feel what I get okay

00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,539
um alright so now after you get accepted

00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:28,630
then you should go back to something new

00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:31,690
and start again okay okay alright so now

00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:34,240
what we want to talk about is after the

00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:35,950
four you have to keep that updated if

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,720
you want to update you can't just get

00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,640
poll you have to tell your computer

00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,370
where is it pulling from so you have to

00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:45,780
do a git remote at upstream path to

00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:48,240
original repo so in this case it's a

00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:51,280
blue heart and oh there are some changes

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,409
right our hearts read our remote

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,990
repositories read I want to update it

00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:58,240
how can I do that so then what can we do

00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:01,659
get full upstream master now will update

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:05,580
the changes so then our heart will then

00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:08,919
be blue and we're up to date with the

00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:12,340
remote repository the fourth one alright

00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:13,960
so let's then talk about tricky stuff

00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,600
I'm gonna go a little bit fast because I

00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,770
see the time is ticking away but you

00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,919
don't have to memorize I'll share this

00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:23,020
later okay um tricky stuff when i first

00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:25,720
started if i collaborate and i would ask

00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:27,039
my friend how do you do this I'm get I

00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,049
don't understand she would tell me one

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,280
thing I asked another friend and to tell

00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:32,020
me something else I thought there was

00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,510
one way to do something there's not and

00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:36,309
then out of a pool and then i would ask

00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,990
stack overflow and then i would be just

00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:39,580
lost in this labyrinth and i've done all

00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:41,500
these crazy things and all these mere

00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,210
commits and I don't know where I am so

00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,750
sometimes I just delete my local

00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:48,610
repository and start again git clone or

00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:50,710
sometimes I've made my way out of the

00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:55,659
labyrinth but had some

00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:58,990
commit messages on github so one thing

00:18:55,659 --> 00:19:01,149
that is really awesome is hit stash now

00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:02,770
I've been working on a branch and I

00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:04,870
thought I was on a different branch I

00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:07,179
mean always changes and then I do life

00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:09,640
all I don't want these changes here what

00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:11,860
can you do put those changes aside and

00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:15,610
then go to another branch and then apply

00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:18,340
them so that's good stash okay and

00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:20,020
that's if you do get stash it'll stash

00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:22,350
your files but now you're untracked

00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:25,270
files if you do get stitched so uh

00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:27,850
that's you you will get the interact

00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:31,779
files this way alright so for example

00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:35,710
let's say you're at work and then you

00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:37,809
get feeling like you want to dance oh oh

00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:41,520
that's a mistake you might be fire so

00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:48,789
what do you do you got a stash national

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:51,600
party branch you apply okay that's we're

00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:51,600
lucky okay so

00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:57,179
so we have his stature fly that's just

00:19:54,780 --> 00:20:00,750
applying the stache to wherever you are

00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:03,000
and then after you apply it you can drop

00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:06,210
it that's deleting it from your list of

00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,580
stashes so if you're done you can do git

00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:11,490
stash drop one thing that will do both

00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:14,250
of these and one is get stash pop and

00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:16,260
this is very useful so you don't forget

00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:19,799
to delete it later you have a huge list

00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:22,470
of stashes all right and one thing I

00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:24,990
find this pretty cool is git stash

00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:27,510
branch like party branch or whatever

00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:30,809
pressure on this will do all that it

00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:34,380
will create a new branch and apply those

00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:36,179
stashes to this French so if I my work

00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,500
branch what i can do is get that party

00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:39,299
branch and it will take all the changes

00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,890
in a plot create party branch and apply

00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:42,150
them there so i don't don't worry about

00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:45,330
that i've done this more than once

00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:49,650
alright so now we're going to move on to

00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:52,679
on time to local commit you made commit

00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:58,260
and you realize you didn't want to what

00:20:52,679 --> 00:21:01,679
do you do ok so here is git reset and

00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:03,320
and then to you can put to you could put

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,690
five that's the number of how many

00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,490
commits back you want to go ok one

00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:12,090
example would be if you're on party

00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:15,090
branch you have too much juice and you

00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:20,780
make some mistakes oh so you can get

00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:20,780
reset maybe two steaks ago ok so

00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:30,380
also you can do get reset hard head to

00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:33,529
this is a hard reset but be careful with

00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:36,169
hard because your modified files will

00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:38,990
not be they'll be discarded they will be

00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:42,500
deleted oh and one other thing that's

00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:43,850
useful is specifying the commit number i

00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:47,120
just put some random one don't try to

00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:50,179
find it get reset hard and this will go

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:53,659
back to that specific commit and that's

00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:55,250
why the labels are important this will

00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:57,200
only work if you haven't pushed your

00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:59,330
changes yet so be careful when using

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:03,440
hard because your local changes will

00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:05,570
disappear ok let's go on to removing

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,960
file before you saw I had a list of

00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:10,399
passwords passes I added them oh how can

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,519
i delete them I don't want everyone to

00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:18,139
know what passwords so you can do get RM

00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:21,139
which remove list of passwords but Oh ty

00:22:18,139 --> 00:22:24,529
that and delete it from your computer as

00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:27,950
well so what can you do you can remove

00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:31,970
the add files by reset reset is like

00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:34,669
opposite of AD and it will on it'll take

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:35,899
it off from the queue ok and after

00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:37,850
you've done that you want to add it to

00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:42,980
get ignore so that you don't add it

00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:44,539
again on accident alright if anyone has

00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,760
seen this it's pretty entertaining for

00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:48,919
like a minute and then boring so commit

00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,600
blogs from last night you can see I

00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:52,909
cover up the sensitive over the

00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:57,049
inappropriate formation but when you're

00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:58,070
tired exhausted and will night or if you

00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:00,710
don't want your doing you get frustrated

00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:04,039
you can have some iffy some sketchy

00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:07,700
commit messages and so how can you

00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:08,870
change those don't worry you can edit ok

00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:12,950
and that's well I'm going to tell you

00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:15,860
about edit a commit message that's get

00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:20,539
commit amend this will open a text

00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:23,840
editor you change your message solved or

00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:25,460
you can do get commit am & M message

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,159
that sounds like I know what I'm doing

00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:30,540
right and but um be careful because

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:33,870
these don't change

00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:35,910
it makes a new commit okay but that can

00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:39,000
be useful too because if you forgot to

00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:43,530
add a file what you can do is you can

00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:47,490
get at forgotten file and then get from

00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:50,580
it amend and you're safe if you want to

00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:54,750
check what you are ready to push this is

00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:57,150
very useful get jipped sad cached origin

00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:59,960
master it'll tell you what you're about

00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:03,720
to push before you make maybe a mistake

00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:08,040
alright so now we've gone through those

00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,540
let's go get a ticket what can we say

00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,130
about get a kit when you're on github

00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,720
when you're collaborating you want to

00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:14,520
check the issues before you started a

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,950
new issue if someone's already done it

00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,870
or talked about it you don't need to

00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:21,960
bring it up or it might be a result

00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:24,120
issue okay so check the history also you

00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,960
want to name your branches descriptively

00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:30,480
so people know what you're doing you

00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:33,630
also want to keep your changes small I'm

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,790
very ambitious and I see a small change

00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:37,020
one tag one small thing I want to change

00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:39,090
it and then I find something else and

00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:42,420
find something else and then I have all

00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:43,740
these changes on one branch so you want

00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,390
to make sure to keep the change is small

00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:49,320
just making a branch and you can do

00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:52,230
another PR respect the coding style the

00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:56,280
original coding style don't change the

00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:57,660
whole file just because you don't code

00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,790
like that you want to try to maintain

00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:03,450
their their structure and their coding

00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:04,980
style and also play nice be nice to

00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:08,640
everyone assume everyone is doing their

00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:10,830
best if it's your repository try to be

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,560
helpful if you deny someone full request

00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:16,830
maybe share a resource or let them know

00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:20,820
how they can improve if you're trying to

00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:22,350
do a pull request don't in your issue

00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,670
when you're making sure you can be nice

00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:25,120
and assume that maybe you know they were

00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:29,320
busy that's why they couldn't do some

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:32,260
or they list it all right but so this

00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:34,809
week of Earl I should something wouldn't

00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:37,559
feel the line but so it's okay to be

00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:40,960
overwhelmed and this is just the start

00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:43,210
so but one thing I want to tell you is

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,940
you don't feel overwhelmed practice and

00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:48,880
repetition and cheat sheets is the key

00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:50,800
it may be a look a bit confusing and

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,450
scary from the outside but it isn't and

00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,370
you're not alone especially with the

00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:57,610
awesome Daniel community and you can

00:25:54,370 --> 00:26:00,130
always reach out for help so I hope you

00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:01,840
can use the emergency exit then I share

00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:05,220
with you today and good luck on your

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,220
journey so thank you

00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,890
