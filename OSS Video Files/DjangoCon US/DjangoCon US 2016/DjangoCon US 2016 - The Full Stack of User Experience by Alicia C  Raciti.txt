Description: 
	The Full Stack of User Experience by Alicia C  Raciti

User experience (UX) has come to the forefront of the design world over the last 5-10 years. As the internet and its content have evolved, weâ€™re asking now more than ever about user goals when they visit the websites and software we create.

UX terms like Information Architecture, Interaction Design, and Research are regularly thrown around, but what are they and how does it impact a site and product?

This talk will define UX and itâ€™s sub-disciplines to bring understanding to what UX is. Practical deliverables will be shared in an effort to give attendees something that they can begin to implement into their process.

This talk was presented at: https://2016.djangocon.us/schedule/presentation/41/

come on

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:21,270
awesome let's get started so the full

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,040
stack of music experience we have full

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,720
stack developers which are from what I

00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,119
understand front-end and back-end may

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,550
kind of do everything user experience

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,800
has these different disciplines as well

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,210
and today we're going to talk about them

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,930
a little bit what are their goals why

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:40,290
are they here essentially with the

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,790
designers you work with like I want you

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,429
to come away with at least some language

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,449
to be able to talk with them but also

00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:48,600
some key words if you want to go to

00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:50,519
google and some do some more searching

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,789
and a deeper dive in the user experience

00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:57,989
I will try to hold some time at the end

00:00:53,789 --> 00:01:00,149
for Q&A so to get started why did you

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:03,480
use your experience which what's this yu

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,519
xing it is a hot topic right now UX

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,400
designers there are not enough of us for

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,680
all the job openings statistic from

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,380
jareds pool there is a UX design school

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,090
opening up and Chattanooga Tennessee if

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,939
you decide to change careers and want to

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:22,020
do this at some point so to get started

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:23,729
usability gov defines it as your

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,159
experience focuses on having a deep

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:29,780
understanding of users so users are

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:34,649
number one what they need so user needs

00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:38,040
but they value we also need business

00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:42,990
goals and objectives our users abilities

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:46,289
and also their limitations so that's our

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:50,130
usability Gulf definition Nielsen Norman

00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:53,369
group is an organization in the UX world

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,770
will do a lot of research into behavior

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:58,619
of people and how they use the web and

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,310
products they have a little bit broader

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:04,469
of an approach here on their definition

00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:06,420
user experience encompasses all aspects

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:09,350
of the end users interaction with the

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,009
company its services and its products

00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:13,200
definitely little bit more abroad

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:15,510
usability of is definitely more

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,300
pinpointed however the key takeaways

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,430
that we used to define user experience

00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,120
as we focus on our users we focus on

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:26,170
products Oh

00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:28,450
some services focus on goals of our

00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:31,659
users and our businesses and we focus on

00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:34,150
our users and our business objectives so

00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:37,720
that that's the broad stroke tape of

00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:40,360
what is user experience so why is it

00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,549
important why is all of a sudden there's

00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,049
like a ton of jobs out there and not

00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:48,390
enough designers to fill them and every

00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:51,239
company is asking for UX designer so

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,680
companies are now finding out that if

00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,150
your users are not enjoying their

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,129
service or the product that your company

00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,920
is offering they will leave they will

00:02:57,129 --> 00:03:01,660
take their business somewhere else Apple

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,790
is definitely the first company to kind

00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,560
of to promote user experience and it's

00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,329
kind of the standard right now a lot of

00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,480
designers will here we want to be like

00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:12,609
Apple and Apple apples Apple because

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,470
it's Apple um you know you're a large

00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:17,739
company if you work in finance it's

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,599
going to be hard to be Apple so that's

00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,370
why you x is important is the customer

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,739
your customer base is starting to demand

00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,840
it you're starting to compare your

00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:31,630
product to other great products out

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:36,340
there so the disciplines of user

00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:37,930
experience there's a lot and I know if

00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,139
you're at Tracy Osborne's talk yesterday

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:43,090
I did see that she had this slide in her

00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:45,849
deck as well there's a lot that goes

00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:48,849
into user experience in general into

00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:51,280
design there's a lot to think about so

00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:52,989
this graphic is by dan staffer and he

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,900
with this he aims to kind of organize

00:03:52,989 --> 00:04:01,290
all the different areas that user that

00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:03,819
consists of user experience but today

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:06,220
we're going to be talking about six core

00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:08,620
disciplines and these are typically

00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,079
found within the digital realm but also

00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,540
just in general when I say products I'm

00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:18,070
not just speaking to Digital there is

00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:20,590
people get they translate ux MTG digital

00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:23,320
user experience can be digital it can be

00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:25,780
as we're seeing with this building not

00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,340
all elevators go to all floors you know

00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:33,080
what's going on with that experience

00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:36,050
digital oh yeah so when I say products

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,610
I'm being very broad here but the core

00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:41,120
disciplines when we talk about digital

00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:44,330
we talk about user research we talk

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,360
about content strategy information

00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:50,090
architecture interaction design visual

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,330
design and then usability and analytics

00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:55,760
so there's the sciences part there's the

00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,060
art part and they everything comes

00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,620
together before it even makes it to code

00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:04,729
so it's left brain that's right brain

00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:07,340
and all comes together does that so to

00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:10,070
get started public transportation is a

00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:12,410
good example of what can be good you XO

00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:14,840
what could be bad us um so for those of

00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:16,460
us in Philadelphia and for anybody who

00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,280
has who is visiting Philadelphia if

00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:23,840
you've written our public transportation

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,639
septa so depending on what mode of

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,990
transportation with septa you are

00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:31,340
writing you will have a different form

00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:36,410
of payment so on some trays it's cash

00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:39,680
only on buses it's tokens on some other

00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:40,940
like it's just a hot mess openings and

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,860
it makes it very difficult when you

00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:47,270
transfer that's like yeah when you

00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,430
transfer from one mode of transportation

00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:51,919
that takes tokens to another mode of

00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,630
transportation that's cash only and the

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,820
world doesn't really carry cash anymore

00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,960
like most people are using credit at

00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,120
this point and you get on the training

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,560
they go oh yeah you have to get off at

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,020
the next stop because you can't pay your

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,539
way to get to where you're going really

00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,729
hard so we're not gonna be talking about

00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:09,740
septa today though we are we talking

00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:12,020
about a completely different public mode

00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:15,440
of public transportation that is

00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:18,080
Transport for London which houses the

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,690
london underground or bus system their

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,000
coach system and we'll be examining a

00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:26,180
lot of that today how many people have

00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,490
been to London awesome so I went for the

00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:33,139
first time about three weeks ago and I

00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:34,669
was like oh my gosh this is amazing so

00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:38,240
we'll go through and examine some things

00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:40,130
so one of the best things about

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,490
Transport for London is they have a

00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:43,490
wreck

00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,810
mobile logo you know this is transfer

00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,310
you know this is the underground even

00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:50,810
though it does not say underground on it

00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:53,360
this is the bank street I icon that they

00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:55,099
use so you notice the underground by the

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,430
way it looks and you know its Bank

00:06:55,099 --> 00:07:01,250
Street with the typography on it it's

00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:04,520
also used as a wayfinding tool so here

00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:07,220
this is a bus stop same circle with a

00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,479
line same iconography but it looks a

00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,009
little bit of a friend it helps with

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,720
wayfinding of how you're going to

00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:13,639
navigate around London am I going to

00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,729
navigate on the Underground am I going

00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:19,400
to navigate by bus am I going to

00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:23,900
navigate by coach which is different

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:26,930
than a bus coach coach buses will run

00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:29,330
you between large towns so say from

00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:31,669
London all the way to bath where your

00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,770
boss is going to is more local to London

00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:39,199
more of what we have here in the States

00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:41,300
so it's valuable design is very

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,389
pervasive throughout all of London's

00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,610
transportation systems so we have the

00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:49,270
visual design in the maps and the

00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:53,060
colours of the different rail lines

00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:55,719
contactless payment so super awesome in

00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:59,000
London if your credit card has

00:07:55,719 --> 00:08:01,490
rfid-enabled you don't even have to buy

00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,139
a ticket to get on the subway as you go

00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:06,560
through the turnstile you just wave your

00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:08,210
phone and you're on your way yeah who

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,710
has money on an MTA car that they

00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:16,099
haven't used in a while when they were

00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:18,560
in New York yeah so you know talk about

00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:21,110
pretty awesome the other thing that's

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:25,190
really cool is they have no pets so that

00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:28,909
this is a motet each underground line

00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:30,289
has its own marquette means once you

00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:33,229
learn the mo cats you know what line

00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:35,599
you're on it's a wayfinding tool so you

00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:37,099
take you know London fairly big so you

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,539
finally find the top that you're ready

00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,370
get to the Train you're like in my own

00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:41,479
the right platform and then the training

00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,279
comes in here like this is even the

00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:46,100
right train there's like four trains

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:49,790
that come to that station you can just

00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:52,570
look at the pattern on the seats and go

00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:57,400
no I don't need that yes I

00:08:52,570 --> 00:09:00,550
you will take me where any do so the

00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:03,040
beginning of the UX process starts with

00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,320
user research so up into this point your

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:09,460
business is like we have a grand idea we

00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:11,590
want to be awesome help us okay you know

00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,540
we can't you know the one thing you need

00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:17,080
to do is understand why we need to be

00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:18,760
awesome and that we can't just create

00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:22,800
stuff out of thin air I mean we could

00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,800
but we can't guarantee that it'll work

00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:29,320
so your research is the science ii part

00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,260
of user experience we're using

00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,270
scientific research methods and

00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:37,810
techniques we want to understand who we

00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:41,460
are designing for we want to understand

00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:44,710
our users goals and their motivations

00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:47,860
user research really hones in on what is

00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:49,750
your users behavior we're not asking at

00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,270
this point do you like this product are

00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,490
you going to use my product I products

00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,860
awesome what do you think we're really

00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,690
honing at what is your users behavior

00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,970
because the goal of user research is to

00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:03,550
identify how your product will naturally

00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:06,160
fit into the behavior of your user

00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:07,720
because you can't you could change how

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,430
your user behaves we're seeing that with

00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,930
Pokemon go a lot of people are spending

00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:15,640
time outside you know so there is a way

00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,710
to change your users behavior you kind

00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,140
of need a baseline to understand where

00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:22,210
they're at and what's going to get them

00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:26,620
what's going to get somebody to go

00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:28,570
outside and play a game like that you

00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:31,990
also need to understand what are your

00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:34,830
users expectations for a product or what

00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,830
are they trying to do

00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:45,360
here in user research you don't want to

00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:47,860
focus on will you find X feature

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,530
valuable because the users don't know

00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:52,750
you don't want to ask users to forecast

00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:55,180
behavior so for example new year's

00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,100
resolutions how many of us are still

00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:01,450
working on our new year's resolutions in

00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:05,020
July yeah ok for those of you who are

00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:06,460
mad props if you ask to December there

00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:09,040
will probably a lot more hands going up

00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:12,280
being like yeah I got resolutions going

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,560
on however to forecast your behavior is

00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:17,020
very difficult because hey maybe

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,490
somebody got sick in March and your new

00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,990
year's resolution go to the gym four

00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:22,360
days a week kind of had to fall through

00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:23,800
because now all of a sudden you your

00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,050
sick or somebody else's sake or

00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,750
something happened it's really hard to

00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:31,150
forecast so you want to stay away with

00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:36,160
our user research from having users

00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:39,190
guess so some techniques that can be

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:42,820
used and the thing user research is even

00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:44,770
it doesn't necessarily have to be your

00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,720
target user research can be very

00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,460
expensive you can pull somebody who's

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,380
not on your project but at your company

00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:54,150
and just get their thoughts on how

00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:57,310
they're going to accomplish a B or C so

00:11:54,150 --> 00:12:00,370
interviews and observations so

00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:03,630
interviews interviews are self-reported

00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:12,850
it's one-on-one time with people so I

00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:14,830
it's impart nagar hey what's up ok so

00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,680
but we have a 101 dialogue i get to ask

00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:20,830
him about what his goals are in trying

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:24,220
to complete a task that task is what my

00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:26,350
product aims to fill and fix and it's

00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,450
self reported in the sense of courts

00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:30,850
going to tell me what his opinions are

00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:32,410
about things any kind of stresses or

00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:36,120
frustrations he has with this building

00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:38,470
and i'm just going to take that back and

00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,150
absolutely be non bias about that and

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,260
understand and if I interview everybody

00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:44,610
here i'm pretty sure everybody will have

00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,610
a complaint about this building here

00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,230
however when you are interviewing people

00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,420
you

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,980
want open-ended question you do not want

00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,650
yes or no questions if you write a

00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:57,530
question and you can end the user cancer

00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:59,720
yes or no not good where a maybe get

00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:02,690
stories here stories are going to

00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,820
provide us context and how our customers

00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:06,440
are going to potentially use our product

00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:08,810
we don't know for sure well we can get

00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,910
an idea and we're trying to gather data

00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:13,370
around that to understand how is our

00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:16,310
product going to fit into our users live

00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:18,350
lives and how is it going to provide

00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:21,050
value when it finds that niche in their

00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:23,540
life you also want to avoid asking

00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:29,020
leading questions so leading questions

00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:29,020
are assuming that potentially somebody

00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:37,400
got a benefit out of something when I'm

00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,280
trying you know let's go with an example

00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:42,080
you didn't question would be did you

00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:45,920
feel that Traci's talk prepared you for

00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:48,770
this plot for this lecture today yes or

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,320
no that's that's a close question but

00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:54,200
also i'm assuming in that question that

00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:57,520
a you went to Traci's talk and be that

00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:00,440
Traci's talk prepared you for that and

00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,880
that's gonna people can feel weird

00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:08,720
especially with Tracy's asking you that

00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:10,700
question so a better way to ask a

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,370
question like that would be how did you

00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:15,410
prepare to come to today's session at

00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:18,260
that point the user can then open up a

00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:19,880
story well I took a boot camp class and

00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:23,300
then now I'm here because I want to

00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:26,440
learn more about Jango and they can tell

00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:30,440
it they can bring you into their world

00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:33,620
so observation so observations are based

00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,830
in anthropological studies of field

00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:39,110
studies and observing people really so

00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:41,300
self-reported is one mechanism however

00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:43,160
observing people people what they say

00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:48,620
and what they do can be completely

00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:50,420
different and its observations give you

00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,070
that extra layer of context and

00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,320
environment to especially if you're

00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:56,060
interviewing somebody not where they're

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,450
working or where they would be using

00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:01,730
your product so enterprise if you work

00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:04,279
on software for companies to

00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:06,829
soon it'd be good to see your users in

00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:10,209
your day I worked I did a project for a

00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:12,769
trading desk like Wall Street traders

00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:14,149
you know what I went up on the trading

00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:18,980
desk and I got to see what was happening

00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:21,459
in their day I'm self-reported my users

00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:25,100
were could not tell me that they used

00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:27,440
the mouse more than the keyboard they

00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,970
would not observe that they would not

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,260
know that about themselves if I asked

00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,240
them about it they would give my homo

00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,010
most people aren't tallying the time

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,230
they are on the mouse versus the time

00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,399
they're typing on a keyboard but

00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:39,709
observing I can see as they're

00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:42,649
interacting with their software in their

00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:44,630
computer that because traders have their

00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:48,560
on the phones they might only have one

00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:50,720
hand free you know that they do a lot of

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,839
mouse clicks which will inform when I go

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,389
to design that maybe I want to stay away

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,800
from clicks on the keyboard and stay

00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:01,220
with clicks on a mouse just because

00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:08,269
their behavior is not a company that

00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:10,579
keyboard clicking keyboard typing so

00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:17,600
content strategy who's heard of content

00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:20,360
strategy okay I said strategy is one of

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:24,139
these not totally pervasive and

00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,819
companies yet but they're learning so

00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:27,800
when people come to your product do they

00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:29,990
are coming to absorb things however

00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,399
they're coming you're your sex going to

00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,410
have content on it you're not just going

00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:35,149
to make it pretty give it a drop-down

00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:41,600
and not put any content in your drop

00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:45,800
down because not useful so the gold

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,449
content strategy is to ensure that your

00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,699
products message is being delivered and

00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:54,920
that your users understand that message

00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:57,440
that is being communicated to them it's

00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:00,290
the voice and tone of how you talk about

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,810
things I you know law firms are very

00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:04,640
formal in their presentation where a

00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:06,530
tech company is a little bit more casual

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,750
and how they might talk about things

00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:11,340
it's you know our lawyers and our

00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:14,790
employees versus our crew and routine

00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:17,310
members and you know how how you're

00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:21,930
going to talk to your customer base

00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:23,970
about that if also covers how how your

00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:25,470
contents going to be governed so I'm

00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,390
pretty sure a lot of us have been the

00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,520
websites and the content is like way way

00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:31,980
way out of date it's for a product that

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,660
might not exist anymore or they change

00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,550
that feature and they didn't take that

00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,770
content down and you came across it and

00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:41,070
you're like what is this your content

00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:42,600
strategist part of their goal is to put

00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:45,570
some kind of governance in place to get

00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,910
rid of what we call content rot so

00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:51,720
rotting content the content that goes

00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:54,090
bad because things move along language

00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,380
changes your products evolve and if

00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,960
you're not taking down all that old

00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,190
stuff somebody's going to come across it

00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,260
and you might get a phone call because

00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:08,070
that help article did not really help

00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:10,800
them so couple things with content

00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:13,620
strategy that you can do and get started

00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:16,220
and it is the writing guidelines so for

00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:18,840
anybody in writing content for your site

00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:21,120
what a day what are the brand values

00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,970
they need to be writing to so your

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,350
products brand what's the voice in tow

00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,750
and I mentioned lawyers are you

00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:30,090
designing a site for for lawyers and it

00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:32,460
needs to be very formal because that's

00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:35,970
how the legal industry operates or is

00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:38,640
this more of like a technology site hey

00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:42,450
we're fun come work with us you get like

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,370
unlimited tto and like dog friendly kind

00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:46,590
of thing you know like how how are you

00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:49,920
communicating to that word like yeah we

00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:51,690
offer these services and you know the

00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,430
difference between the two is like legal

00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:54,810
services you're usually in a crisis if

00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:57,780
you're going to a lawyer for something

00:18:54,810 --> 00:19:00,570
and you know the big thing to keep in

00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:03,420
mind is on that spectrum you know you

00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:06,240
you do want to be very clear and stated

00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,620
it's not a time to be funny if

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,120
somebody's going through a crisis so

00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,100
this is where content strategy comes in

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,480
is you need to understand the context of

00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,640
your user and how they're absorbing that

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,320
content and your content strategists

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,850
will be like this is how we're talking

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,740
to our users because we did our user

00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:22,250
research well we know that this is our

00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,250
user group

00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:30,529
so message hierarchy so this is how to

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:32,959
tell your story your story will start

00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:38,239
with your primary message of what the

00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:39,489
goal or the brand of your site is you

00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:45,440
want it to be valuable and

00:19:39,489 --> 00:19:47,149
understandable from their secondary

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,009
messaging are the key messages that

00:19:47,149 --> 00:19:51,649
support your primary message so your

00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:54,349
primary messages we are X company here's

00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:55,909
what we do you know the secondary

00:19:54,349 --> 00:19:59,089
messaging this may be why you're doing

00:19:55,909 --> 00:20:00,529
what you're doing and you want to

00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:02,899
consider the facts and the data on the

00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:06,049
page as well as you're putting these

00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:09,049
messages together and then any calls to

00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:12,829
action so the big thing what content is

00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:15,019
I come to a so website I gather content

00:20:12,829 --> 00:20:16,639
what do I do with that content now the

00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:19,159
big thing that you want to make sure is

00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:21,979
when you're writing content or asking a

00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:25,369
Content writer for content is can you

00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:26,959
use your take action on that content if

00:20:25,369 --> 00:20:30,049
it's legal content like your terms of

00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:32,539
service maybe not however anything else

00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:35,629
am I are you positioning me to sell

00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:38,539
something do you want me to buy do you

00:20:35,629 --> 00:20:40,159
want me to get help you know how am I

00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:41,709
going to get help you know you're

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,529
messaging me that something's wrong

00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:47,389
great what do I do now you know putting

00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:49,099
messaging in line that's like here's how

00:20:47,389 --> 00:20:51,499
you go get help to fix your problem

00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:57,739
rather than providing dead ends so call

00:20:51,499 --> 00:21:01,549
to action are incredibly important and

00:20:57,739 --> 00:21:04,759
then metadata so metadata it totally

00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:06,109
comes in to content strategy strategy we

00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:07,729
spend all this time putting these

00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:09,349
guidelines together figuring out our

00:21:07,729 --> 00:21:12,469
voice and tone and what we want to say

00:21:09,349 --> 00:21:14,479
to the customer so using SEO analytics

00:21:12,469 --> 00:21:17,239
and the guidelines that we've put

00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:20,419
together what's the metadata going to be

00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:22,699
on the pages how is that going to

00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:25,339
populate throughout your title tags and

00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:30,019
your description tags HTML tags and your

00:21:25,339 --> 00:21:33,679
title there's HTML title tags because

00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:35,509
SEO is going to come for them and user

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,760
research we know what language our users

00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:37,170
are

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,740
using to reference what could be our

00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:44,670
product refiling user research now

00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:49,170
informs us and then you can go go on

00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:51,060
from there so taking a look at this

00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:56,850
because content strategy is still a

00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:59,970
little tool to grasp so New York MTA

00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:01,620
which owns the subway and Transport for

00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:05,010
London or both public entities and they

00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:07,860
have to publish their budgets pretty dry

00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:12,060
information however this is the first

00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:14,160
line of the body of their body copy so

00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:17,580
they have their title hey you know we're

00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:19,800
here for budgets Transport for London is

00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,570
pretty informative this is the budget

00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:25,820
year we just passed it was passed on

00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:32,550
this date here's what you can find here

00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:34,680
MTA's like here's PDF enjoy you know so

00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:36,960
you might not know what these are

00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:40,770
exactly is coming for when they come to

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,350
the budgets page what to help them it's

00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:45,870
studying context you know Transport for

00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:47,820
London its setting context that okay I

00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:49,830
know this is a recent budget I'm looking

00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:52,800
at and I know what the goal of this

00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:54,600
budget is for the MTA I'm just I'm

00:22:52,800 --> 00:23:02,400
expecting a giant Excel spreadsheet

00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:03,660
right now so so yeah so with content

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,790
strategy you want to void content

00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:09,330
wrought by having a governance plan as

00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:11,910
well so this is some type of intake copy

00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:13,860
scroll maybe every six months maybe once

00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:17,630
a year to get rid of the old stuff

00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:21,450
introduce new stuff things like that

00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:23,190
moving on information architecture so

00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:25,890
this is my personal love I love

00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:28,620
organizing things who loves organizing

00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:34,110
their closets has anybody organize your

00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:35,280
sock drawer oh yeah so

00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:38,160
creation architecture in the digital

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:41,670
sense it's the underlying glue to

00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:44,760
everything that's going on it focuses on

00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:46,440
the organization and relationships of

00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,900
your content so this is why we don't

00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,000
wait for content to be the last thing

00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:54,270
because we need content organized on

00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,670
this site right so to save your content

00:23:54,270 --> 00:24:02,750
for lasses not going to help very much

00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:05,549
so I mentioned information architecture

00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:09,720
we organize information we create

00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:12,150
relationships we take your content a and

00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:15,000
you content q you're related so we're

00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:18,179
going to put you together a lot of I had

00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,600
on my first slide the post-its you Xers

00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:23,190
love post is and they're also because

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,040
you can take that information and create

00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:27,720
relationships with that with the content

00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:35,340
that they're content strategist is

00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:39,230
working on so here we're talking about

00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:46,230
structuring and labeling mad class you

00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:48,870
structuring how how is it working as age

00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:50,910
or how is the content related to each

00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:54,150
other but then within those

00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:55,860
organizations little clumps of related

00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:57,960
content how do those relate to the other

00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,820
things around it and then how does it

00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,370
relate to the product so it's this

00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:04,559
really like you have one posted you have

00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:07,429
a group of post-its you have a wall of

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,540
post-its you have a room of posted and

00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:10,799
everything is tied together and

00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:14,270
everything relates to one another

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:17,010
everything can play off of each other so

00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:19,650
the whole goal of structuring is to work

00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:26,370
to provide meaning of behind the content

00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:29,340
and it also provides structures so an

00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:31,049
example I often give of I is Bed Bath &

00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,460
Beyond when you go and it's like

00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:34,620
anything and everything for your home

00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:37,620
you can get lost in there however if I

00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:42,330
found laundry products in my kitchen

00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:44,070
section okay who's going like huh yeah

00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:48,270
that's information architecture

00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:50,160
it's putting those relationships so you

00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:51,840
know your laundry detergent should not

00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,520
go next you know probably doesn't go

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,230
next to your dish detergent because your

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,670
dis detergent typically from your user

00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:58,080
research you know is classified it's

00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:59,970
kitchen I have a kitchen cleaning item

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:04,710
so maybe it goes in the kitchen section

00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:06,870
or you know your utensil dividers you

00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:08,970
know did you hear utensil dividers

00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:11,160
belong next to the dryer balls that go

00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:13,520
into the drying machine you know like

00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,810
yeah I see faces you're like huh

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,910
information architecture goes you two

00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:21,510
people you two items you don't belong

00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:24,540
together but you two you know the

00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:25,860
utensil rack and the baking pans you all

00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:30,870
can go together you can hang out be

00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:33,180
friends labeling so labeling is super

00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:37,380
super super important because it conveys

00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:40,580
meaning and in the world of taxonomy

00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:42,960
which is defining of terms and concepts

00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:45,050
you know who's been on a project where

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,970
you've had four terms for one concept

00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:51,120
business how's it one thing research

00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:54,000
telling another yep so legally it's

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,230
incredibly important because you can

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,370
have exactly what you're dealing with on

00:26:55,230 --> 00:27:00,860
your team's right now and a lot of

00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:02,970
confusion can happen because of them so

00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,680
working on your labels and how do you

00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:07,200
get to your labels you do your research

00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:09,030
to understand how your users are talking

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,040
about things and what kind of language

00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:13,230
they're using and then you work with the

00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,520
content strategist who helps to figure

00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:17,580
out like okay we're going to talk about

00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:19,020
the product in these terms and then

00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,450
we're going to label things based off of

00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:26,160
all that work that's been done up until

00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:30,240
now so couple I examples outside of

00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:32,670
digital so in the underground larger

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,730
stations actually have won by a hallways

00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:37,800
so we'll see no entry and you'll see the

00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:39,870
underground and once you get underground

00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,610
in the large stations it's literally a

00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:43,200
single hallway everybody's moving in the

00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:46,050
same way you're not running into people

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,810
who are going opposite of you really

00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:50,580
awesome for traffic flow and getting you

00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:52,519
to where you need to so we're running

00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:55,429
through the tunnel and we get

00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:56,899
platform what do we do oh my gosh how do

00:27:55,429 --> 00:27:59,779
I know where I'm going to go and what

00:27:56,899 --> 00:28:03,499
line them on and am I going east west

00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:05,749
north south these are awesome because it

00:28:03,499 --> 00:28:08,659
tells you northbound serves these

00:28:05,749 --> 00:28:10,580
stations southbound so these stations

00:28:08,659 --> 00:28:12,619
depending on where you want to go the

00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:15,349
sign is going to help you and the

00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:17,989
labeling based off of usually location

00:28:15,349 --> 00:28:19,729
in the public transportation area it's

00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:23,029
going to tell you where you're going so

00:28:19,729 --> 00:28:25,190
you come here and you're like okay jus

00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:26,659
i'm on the Jubilee Line awesome i'm

00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:28,329
going to go south down we're going to go

00:28:26,659 --> 00:28:32,089
we're going to go see the london bridge

00:28:28,329 --> 00:28:35,989
great so we go and get on the platform

00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:38,989
the train pulls up Oh awesome it's the

00:28:35,989 --> 00:28:41,899
Jubilee Line marquette so now we know

00:28:38,989 --> 00:28:44,109
we're on the train right now information

00:28:41,899 --> 00:28:46,609
architecture is the underlying is

00:28:44,109 --> 00:28:50,419
underlying all of that is helping you

00:28:46,609 --> 00:28:53,239
weigh fine and we talked about site maps

00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:55,029
and navigation structures all of that

00:28:53,239 --> 00:29:10,249
falls in information architecture

00:28:55,029 --> 00:29:11,659
wireframes as well interaction design so

00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:13,429
people are coming your product you're

00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:16,629
looking for stuff you're obviously going

00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:19,099
to interact with it somehow so

00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:20,479
interaction design focuses on the

00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:22,129
behavior of the product and the

00:29:20,479 --> 00:29:24,889
interaction between the user and your

00:29:22,129 --> 00:29:28,219
product so how does your product respond

00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:31,999
to the user's input you see this a lot

00:29:28,219 --> 00:29:34,070
with phones the tap the swipe how do you

00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:35,869
know to navigate around there was a

00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:37,279
designer who was like we're going to

00:29:35,869 --> 00:29:38,509
make this we're going to make

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:42,019
this attack we're going to make this one

00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:44,979
a tap and hold a designer is actually

00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:44,979
thinking about this stuff

00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:56,299
so your interaction designer is going to

00:29:53,370 --> 00:30:00,870
be focused on the environment and

00:29:56,299 --> 00:30:03,659
transitions so your environments are

00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:07,110
setting the context for your user and

00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:10,440
i'm here in huntsman hall at penn using

00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:15,750
my phone I am at home using my desktop

00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:17,940
to work on lot to do work at work those

00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:20,220
are your environments and that context

00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:24,299
might change how what you're going to

00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:26,720
serve to your user base the transitions

00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:29,010
are moving between context so I start

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,600
you know Amazon's really great at this I

00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:33,510
start browsing something on my phone and

00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:36,000
then I'm like at home on my you know

00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:37,649
sitting on the couch on my iPad and they

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,630
go oh hey yeah you're browsing this or

00:30:37,649 --> 00:30:41,640
you added this to your cart then I go my

00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:43,529
desktop cuz I'm still weird about

00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,770
purchasing stuff on my mobile devices

00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:48,059
like and it's like they're you know all

00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:49,440
throughout these different you know I'm

00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:51,960
moving I'm transitioning between

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,679
contacts I'm able to pick up right where

00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,679
I left off

00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:05,720
so the users environment will impact how

00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:07,370
you present that information so whether

00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,320
you're on a mobile device or if your

00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:11,630
desktop if you're planning your journey

00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:14,299
on public transportation or if you're in

00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:15,799
the middle of your journey are you if

00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:18,679
I'm in the middle of my journey i'm most

00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:21,350
likely not on a desktop or a laptop of

00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:25,280
some sort so how is your product going

00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:26,809
to meet those user needs as they switch

00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:32,750
between these environments in these

00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:35,840
contacts these contexts transitions are

00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:38,570
key and we see this as you take public

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:41,179
transit the transition of buying your

00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:43,850
ticket to getting to actually getting on

00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:45,260
to the train platform to boarding the

00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:48,409
train to getting off the train at your

00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:49,549
stop you know and here in Philly we

00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:50,929
don't have to do it but I know in New

00:31:49,549 --> 00:31:52,429
York you have to swipe your card again

00:31:50,929 --> 00:31:54,020
i'm pretty sure i can fit there in a

00:31:52,429 --> 00:31:55,520
while but in line then you swipe your

00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:57,710
card to go in and you swipe your card to

00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:59,000
go out and then it charges it here in

00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:02,539
philly we don't do that it's like pay

00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,760
when you go on you're good um those

00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:06,530
transitions are key and understanding

00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:09,409
and making things easier you know that

00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:14,140
contactless I brought up like the

00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:14,140
awesome if America had that but we don't

00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:21,080
so looking at this digitally this is the

00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,840
status updates for the London

00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:25,970
Underground so here we can see on the

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,200
left side our information architecture

00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:32,230
shows here's all the different lines

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,700
here's all this all the statuses from

00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:37,309
London Overground and Piccadilly line or

00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:39,770
having some issues and this is the

00:32:37,309 --> 00:32:40,940
default map that we're seeing so

00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:43,789
typically you see the London Underground

00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:46,669
nap nap you have all these colors but

00:32:43,789 --> 00:32:49,070
here the colors are kind of gone you see

00:32:46,669 --> 00:32:51,500
there's this to how going about this

00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:56,240
we've got blue and there's like an

00:32:51,500 --> 00:33:00,140
orange here orange here and it's like

00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:03,549
okay like are those working are they not

00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:06,620
working but turns out you can change

00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:07,210
your context of how your understanding

00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:11,049
this infant

00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:13,570
so your interaction designer is right

00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:16,390
now they have there is this like menu

00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:17,950
that pops up over you know your

00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:22,450
interaction designer in the digital

00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:26,080
space could it be a radio button that

00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:29,380
allows you to switch you no could it be

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:31,029
an overlay they're determining your

00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,500
interaction designer is looking at all

00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:34,480
these different things and how is

00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:38,710
somebody going to interact with these

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:40,899
and then this is the mobile screen so

00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:44,320
here and then if you want to view the

00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:46,539
map you click and it just like appears

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,580
and there's no have nations or anything

00:33:46,539 --> 00:33:51,730
your interaction designer can totally

00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:53,980
put in simple animations well you all

00:33:51,730 --> 00:34:01,090
can code the animations they'll they'll

00:33:53,980 --> 00:34:03,970
say we can do an animation so to

00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:06,279
continue on visual design so this is

00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:07,750
like so much right like some in some

00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:11,139
companies there's one person who does

00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:12,909
all of this FYI so visual design this is

00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:16,389
like the first impression that people

00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:18,339
usually have they look they pulled the

00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:20,230
projects like oh this looks awesome your

00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:21,669
business is going to say more about your

00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:24,190
visual design and they will about your

00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:26,619
information architecture or anything any

00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:28,990
of the other work you've done just

00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:30,790
because it's something about color and

00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:33,609
typography that give people that this

00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:36,220
like this visceral reaction of like oh I

00:34:33,609 --> 00:34:37,659
love it or like oh that's awful there's

00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:39,879
just something about our information

00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:42,480
architecture really content strategy for

00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:47,349
life I'm very cool like like your idea

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:49,240
so with visual design visual designers

00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:53,409
established systems and they establish

00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:55,480
patterns and there'd be you know the

00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:57,400
whole goal of this is to be utilized and

00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:00,280
reused and reused and reused with a

00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,650
variety of different products visual

00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:05,109
design will differentiate as we saw

00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:07,420
earlier with the London Underground and

00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:08,830
Transport for London roundel as they

00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:14,650
call them with the circle in the line

00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:16,599
across but it also unifies so you know

00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:17,810
with the roundel week you know we saw

00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:20,450
earlier

00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:22,700
oh that's the underground oh that's the

00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:24,740
bus oh that's the coach they all look

00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,990
the same but they're different so it's

00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:29,240
unifying that this is a transportation

00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:36,680
mode differentiating what mode of

00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:37,970
transportation so here and I know there

00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:41,060
were some talks on this a little bit

00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:44,000
earlier so visual design you know some

00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:49,430
aspects of it are typography color and

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:52,040
space so typography we use heading sizes

00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:54,020
to designate the hierarchy of the page

00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,270
so your information architecture is

00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:58,340
going to go these groups of information

00:35:56,270 --> 00:36:00,260
go together your visual designer is

00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:03,580
going to lay them and out in a way so

00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:07,040
that your user can visually distinguish

00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:09,200
group a belongs up here in Group B is

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:13,700
this group of information in groups sees

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:15,320
this information headings always help

00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:18,260
with that that's why we have I think

00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:20,500
what is it up to H sixes and the HTML

00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:22,820
now I'm not coding that much anymore so

00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:25,880
you know but there's a reason for that

00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:28,490
and you can utilize it here we use

00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,680
colored is to distinguish a lot from one

00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:32,390
another so there's a you know there's

00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:35,120
definitely accessibility that needs to

00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:38,180
be you know thought about here we're not

00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:40,930
going to get into that today and then

00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:45,440
space so space is the other form of

00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:47,360
another way of showing architecture you

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,510
have your heading of an h1 and then your

00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:52,970
paragraph but then visually representing

00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:54,290
like this item in this item that's a

00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:59,450
little bit further away or two

00:36:54,290 --> 00:37:01,790
completely separate I don't so if using

00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:04,460
around alt for Transport for London and

00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:08,390
it's really cool to see how one I

00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:10,420
comment can be used in eight nine ten

00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:13,240
eleven different ways to represent

00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:15,380
eleven different modes a train at well

00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,880
really like ten modes of transportation

00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:20,120
because that first one is to transport

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:23,120
for london loca but the differentiation

00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:26,050
between them too so your eye is like we

00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:28,520
need a logo we need a way to say this

00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:29,010
this is a motor joint special mode of

00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,600
transfer

00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:32,220
asian but your visual designer will go

00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:37,640
okay this is how we're going to tell

00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:40,710
them all apart here you know we see

00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:43,560
really big like coaches this is a coach

00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:47,190
stop and we can actually see behind here

00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:48,870
we have a bus stop to spatially they're

00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:51,120
not even on top of each other they're

00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:55,890
like maybe you know a couple feet apart

00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:58,080
but on the coach sign it's clearly okay

00:37:55,890 --> 00:38:02,100
this is a coach stop here's the stop

00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:03,480
name we're at Hyde Park Corner here here

00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:06,990
are the buses that come here the coach

00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:14,070
buses and then without getting in the

00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:18,780
details here's the bus operator so

00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:20,880
usability and analytics so you usability

00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:24,360
is really awesome because we did all

00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:27,090
this work and now we get to test it also

00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:35,100
science come back comes to play back in

00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:37,680
here so why do we want to do usability

00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:39,210
is anybody sent out code without q

00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:43,710
eyeing it like do you do that normally

00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:47,280
and that's what I thought so usability

00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:49,800
is our way of testing whether our design

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,320
met what we learned so we dinner user

00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:54,540
research and we can set up hypothesis on

00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,820
the user research then we do all the

00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:59,820
content strategy in the ia interaction

00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:02,310
design and official design and it looks

00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:05,310
awesome no usability is going to tell us

00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:06,690
how close we were to that mark that we

00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:08,550
were able to gather from the user

00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:11,340
research that we did all the way at the

00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:14,180
beginning so it's harder than oqa

00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:14,180
essentially

00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:25,130
so some techniques for usability studies

00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:27,120
there are task-based starting so here

00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:31,170
you tell you're going to have your

00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:33,780
participant go I need you to plan a trip

00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:39,810
you're going to you're going to plan a

00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:42,180
trip from Westminster Westminster Abbey

00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:45,510
over to the London Bridge can you show

00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:46,890
me how to get there and your user would

00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:49,650
go through your transport for london

00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:55,110
site and you know hopefully they have no

00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:58,740
problems however if you find after three

00:39:55,110 --> 00:40:00,750
or four or five participants that they

00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:04,260
keep getting hung up on one aspect of

00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:06,810
that plan your journey or you're just

00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:08,400
not able to complete it at all that's

00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:10,260
obviously an area where you're going to

00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,940
have to go back and rethink what the

00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:14,900
good news is is you didn't code it so

00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:18,600
it's a little bit easier to do that now

00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:20,160
so task based studies that's that's

00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:23,340
really what it's for at this point you

00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:26,130
can start asking questions about you

00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:30,090
know about the product like can you tell

00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:32,430
me what you see here and how you know

00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:36,480
how would you use a B and C on this

00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:39,090
product the one thing with the task

00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,980
based study though is if a user is

00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:42,540
struggling so if you're having somebody

00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:46,650
plan their trip on the Transport for

00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:48,960
London site and they're like really

00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:53,280
really struggling do not show them how

00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,480
to do it do you not a we're testing the

00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,370
interface we're not testing our

00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:00,120
participants and we don't want them to

00:40:56,370 --> 00:41:03,240
feel like you're stupid because a lot of

00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:04,980
people will be putting pressure on

00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:08,010
themselves and they're like oh I just

00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:10,620
don't get it it's me um just ask them

00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:14,600
how would you complete this task because

00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:17,340
that's there's a purpose in that and

00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:19,770
okay so we're going to run through this

00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:21,120
real quick but the purpose of asking

00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:25,170
how would you complete this is getting

00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:27,860
insight into how how they're thinking

00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:32,730
and how they would accomplish that task

00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:36,990
0 ok so I'll give you this term you can

00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:40,170
go Google guerrilla usability testing so

00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:43,140
real quick to wrap up user research

00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:45,260
focuses on understanding content

00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:47,400
strategy focuses on communication

00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:50,130
information architecture focuses on

00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:53,730
organization interaction design focuses

00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:56,640
on transitions visual design focuses on

00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:59,910
clarity usability and analytics focuses

00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:03,810
on measurement so ladies and gents that

00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:05,400
is full stack of UX it's a lot at some

00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:07,380
companies you've one person you do this

00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,270
all at work your company's you'll

00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:12,180
usually have people split up into some

00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:14,010
kind of specialties so if you have any

00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:19,580
questions I will be here today you can

00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:19,580
