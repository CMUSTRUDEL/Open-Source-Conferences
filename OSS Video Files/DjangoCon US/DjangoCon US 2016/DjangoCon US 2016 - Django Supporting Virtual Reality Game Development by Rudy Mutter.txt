Description: 
	Django Supporting Virtual Reality Game Development by Rudy Mutter

Virtual reality in 2016 is moving closer to mainstream, especially with game development due to releases from multiple companies (Oculus Rift, Playstation VR, and HTC Vive). We decided to build an entertaining, accessible virtual reality game via Google Cardboard for iOS and Android based on a classic childhood game to find hidden objects in elaborate scenes.

come on

00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:22,470
sweet so this talk is about how we took

00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:26,130
Jengo our favorite tool or our backend

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:28,400
our web frameworks and unity to create a

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,720
game so real quick I was just introduced

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,550
co-founder head of tech Yeti product

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,290
development firm Yeti I also organized

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:37,309
the san francisco django meetup group

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,720
been doing that for a couple years now

00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:41,879
generally full stack developer kind of

00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,010
start a lot with python and django but

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:47,460
i've done swift iphone apps javascript

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,230
angular react java android and then

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,950
recently added c-sharp when I started

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:55,020
the Diamonds community as a kid I love

00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,270
games I'm sure many people here also

00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,770
felt the same growing up I made games an

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,870
RPG maker I don't know if anyone

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,949
familiar with that from a long time ago

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,690
i made this like mutant cow you were

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:09,810
like a farmhand game i don't know i

00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:12,590
still gotta save somewhere on a pc so it

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,810
was really exciting that we undertook

00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:19,770
making a game at yeti so quickly to get

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:21,810
some some context we want to make a game

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:26,099
we wanted to try out virtual reality

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:27,840
where an agency and it was like we oh we

00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:30,330
want to use Django how does Django work

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,429
with unity we want to create an API add

00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,140
some more dynamic functionality and be

00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:39,840
able to have users in the game how do we

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:41,429
hook that up with Django so generally

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,690
we're going to go through today we got

00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:48,209
45 minutes so a longer slot so we got an

00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,619
introduction to virtual reality talking

00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:51,149
about our game a little bit just to

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:53,759
understand the game mechanics and why

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,459
we're using an API how virtual reality

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,550
in unity works some quickly going over

00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:01,349
the Django ap is and then how really the

00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:05,660
meat of this talking that the takeaways

00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:10,590
is how to consume those AP is in unity

00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:11,730
so really quick smaller small aspect

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,220
ratio my slides are gonna be able my

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:16,260
stuff what's not in this talk this isn't

00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,120
I unity what a one talk we're not going

00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,190
to be talking about how do I build my

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,990
first game and unity there are plenty

00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,940
tutorials and other things you can go

00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,280
that would take a really long time

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,000
itself for the API is we use Django rest

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,830
framework

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,080
plenty other toxin tutorials I'm not

00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,540
going to be going in in depth on how to

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,940
use drf so this is not like a

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,860
step-by-step walkthrough let's couple

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,870
together our first game and talk to

00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,880
django and the RF it's way too much i

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,620
will provide a bunch of resources at the

00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,230
end of this talk though where you can go

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,810
to find those things what is in this

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,910
talk the idea is to be familiar enough

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,860
and to know right now what you don't

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,540
know about maybe unity of virtual

00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,760
reality development so that you could go

00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,950
you know where to look to get started

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,800
and really that you don't make the same

00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,780
mistakes that cost me like many weeks of

00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,180
trying to figure out how to get unity to

00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,590
talk to django and just getting familiar

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,300
with it myself coming from a

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:14,250
predominantly python and django

00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:16,470
background also there's a quiz a half

00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,560
way through the talk so you are

00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:21,150
motivated to pay attention the quiz will

00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,489
be happening either via your laptop

00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,430
tablet or phone so make sure you're

00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:27,750
ready with that halfway through all the

00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,190
questions are going to be and the answer

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,440
is going to be things that went over the

00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,810
top two people will get a google

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,580
cardboard i came up with this idea

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:39,840
rather recently so i don't physically

00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:41,910
have them i will ship them i know i know

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,019
they're back we have a bunch back at the

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,120
office sounds like i wish i had this

00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:49,140
idea earlier but I we will ship them to

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,180
you wherever you live uh international

00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,580
lots of Templars that shipping costs

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,310
it's only piece of cardboard but so the

00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:59,940
top two people will get some prizes so

00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:02,130
you should pay attention so quickly I

00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:06,180
want to talk about basically virtual

00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:07,739
reality show of hands who would say

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,739
they're familiar with the different

00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:13,069
virtual reality headsets and platforms

00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,160
and what's going on

00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:20,389
okay maybe maybe half half the audience

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:23,330
says they're familiar so this is going

00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:25,220
to be painful so the brief state of

00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,590
virtual reality there's a picture

00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,810
missing off to the right so right now

00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,880
basically there's the there's virtual

00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,919
reality headsets that deal with using

00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,500
your smartphone and there's ones that

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,229
are likely connecting to your computer

00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:43,130
and so going from left to right there

00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:45,889
we've got the vibe the rift PlayStation

00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:49,520
VR google cardboard and the one off to

00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:51,710
the screen is the gear VR so generally

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,000
the PlayStation one obviously hooks up

00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:57,860
to PlayStation the two on the left are

00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,389
currently you likely have a gaming PC

00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,940
and you're hooking those headsets up

00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:03,889
into your PC the two on the right the

00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:07,669
cardboard is you put your smartphone

00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:09,320
into it either iOS or Android and then

00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:12,320
the gear VR which is off to the right

00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:16,430
there is for your Android phone only

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:20,360
currently so a lot of people have dubbed

00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:23,449
this year as the year of VR so mostly

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:26,120
all of these headsets shipped the Rifton

00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:29,180
vive started to ship out to all the

00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,490
people that pre-ordered it the Samsung

00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:33,169
gear VR started to get packaged with

00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:36,650
actual Android phones that were being

00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:38,659
sold the New York Times sent out to

00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,940
their subscribers a bunch of Google

00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:43,039
cardboards with the with the with their

00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,110
subscription and they also came out with

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:48,020
an app that had a bunch of kind of like

00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:50,750
360 experiences for you to use in the

00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:53,360
cardboard and PlayStation VR kind of the

00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:58,820
last one is due out at the end of the

00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:02,080
year so there's kind of this desktop

00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:05,930
versus mobile so some people consider

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,210
smartphone VR ie the cardboard or the

00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,759
gear basically as like virtual reality

00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:13,340
light and it's pretty true I mean it's

00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,440
hard for you to use your smartphone and

00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,469
repurpose it by putting it in maybe just

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,599
a piece of cardboard versus buying a

00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:22,310
dedicated headset and controllers that

00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:25,400
you plug into your computer that I are

00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,360
taking the full effects of your graphics

00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,919
card that's something few

00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,979
they're all of the things built into the

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,919
headset itself Google cardboard actually

00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:37,219
rebranded as Google VR kind of recently

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,830
so i might interchangeably call it

00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:40,879
google cardboard or google v are

00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,500
essentially google's trying to come out

00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:45,789
with maybe another controller and their

00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,719
own thing called google daydream and

00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:48,979
probably cardboard maybe is in the

00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:50,810
greatest name if they want to make that

00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:52,400
a solid platform that they have

00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,199
marketing behind so the trying to

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,360
rebrand but when we did this several

00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:58,069
months ago it was not Google VR so

00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,879
you'll see me referring it to cardboard

00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:04,789
google v are a big concern with this VR

00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:07,250
lights hence the pumpkin that's throwing

00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:10,099
up on the side there is the is feeling

00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:13,069
nauseous and this screen door effect so

00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:15,770
if you took your smartphone and you put

00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:18,379
it up right in front of your face the

00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:21,409
resolution isn't good enough you will

00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:22,789
see the pixels that are actually on your

00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:24,529
phone and so essentially that's called

00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:26,360
the screen door effect some of the

00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:29,029
dedicated headsets right that you plug

00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,129
into your computer have improved like

00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:32,900
the field of vision and the resolution

00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:34,550
and they've come up they try to come

00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,990
ways you get rid of that screen door

00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,539
effects and make you feel more immersed

00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:42,349
so you less of a chance of getting sick

00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:43,759
while you have it on your head probably

00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:47,180
the other point in fact also is that a

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:50,000
mobile you have limited inputs so the

00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,919
vibe and the rift and PlayStation VR all

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,800
going to have actual other handsets or

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,960
controllers that you are using while

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,900
playing with it the cardboard for

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,180
example has just one interaction point a

00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:04,370
button and the gear has some some

00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,080
buttons and touchpad on the side so a

00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,610
little bit more than cardboard but

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,810
because you're you for cardboard

00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,520
actually have to hold it up to your head

00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:13,069
it's not even strapped on your hands are

00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,080
not free to be using other controllers

00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:16,250
so those are all concerns when trying to

00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,960
make a game thinking about your game

00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:22,789
mechanics so there's some other

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,719
applications right now for VR to

00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:27,949
obviously games was the first one but

00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:30,800
people have started to do a lot more

00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:33,229
around entertainment and media there's

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,399
360 photos and videos there's a whole

00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:36,589
bunch of cameras that have come out

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,620
other some interesting things in like

00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:40,810
education and health care

00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:43,029
and also travel in real estate you

00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:45,760
imagine you could go and explore some

00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:47,440
house via virtual reality sets or you

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,350
could go see where you might be staying

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,740
somewhere from one of like the early

00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:56,080
demos this screenshot is this titans of

00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,660
space which is the cool demo someone put

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,220
together for one of the original oculus

00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,070
development kits where you basically fly

00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,150
around a bunch of the planets and it's

00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:06,400
narrating you through them and talk

00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:09,550
telling about the planet besides how far

00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,200
away it is from the Sun etc so there's a

00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:14,080
lot of possibilities with education in

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,360
the VR space as well so we're going to

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,800
talk about the game really quick just so

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,620
that everyone has an understanding so

00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,120
disclaimer this is the first this is the

00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:26,529
first game I've ever really built in

00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:28,420
launched on an actual platform really it

00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:30,130
was an experiment to try out virtual

00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,890
reality we came up with a proof of

00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:35,380
concept that seems like hey this is

00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:37,140
pretty fun maybe we should build this

00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,880
out further and then we actually created

00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:42,310
what we like to call a Yeti and MLP

00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,779
minimum loveable product versus min a

00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,370
viable product which doesn't necessarily

00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:49,029
that your users are actually going to

00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:50,290
enjoy using your MVP so we tried to come

00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:53,200
up with something that might be fun for

00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:55,779
someone to download try out on on their

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,020
phone and for us as an agency this was

00:09:55,779 --> 00:10:01,209
experiencing tech a bit of a portfolio

00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:03,400
building thing and for fun we have

00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:05,589
basically like twenty percent time at

00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,480
Yeti and this probably spilled over 20

00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:09,010
start in our twenty percent time as a

00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,500
project and then turned into a real one

00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:14,080
we wanted to see through onto the App

00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:16,959
Store so why do we choose Google

00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,750
cardboard accessibility it's only

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,180
fifteen dollars for the headset the

00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:24,400
piece of cardboard at the cheapest there

00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:27,610
are some more luxurious Google

00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:29,200
cardboards you could buy compared to

00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,880
spending hundreds and hundreds of

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,100
dollars right for the dedicated ones

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,180
that you would plug into your computer

00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,470
there's a greater potential audience

00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,450
essentially anyone that owns a

00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:39,850
smartphone can just get a fifteen dollar

00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:42,790
piece of cardboard and become a virtual

00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:44,350
reality user the game we came up with

00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:46,510
which I'll talk about has pretty simple

00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:50,110
game mechanics and doesn't necessarily

00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:53,170
need to take the full control of having

00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,790
a bunch of controllers or any kind of

00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:56,769
room scale VR where you're actually

00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:59,380
moving around the idea is your your

00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:00,639
stand still and it generally it seems

00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,200
more approachable as a first-time

00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,600
virtual reality game that we were

00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,040
building it seemed much easier than

00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,540
maybe tackling all of the different

00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,769
inputs and other things going on with

00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:13,540
the rift of the vibe so the name of the

00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:16,449
game is tiny is essentially if you've

00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:18,490
ever as a kid played the game I spy with

00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:20,380
my little eye you said something and one

00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:25,180
of your friends picked out something

00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:28,209
else nearby it's you're in this 3d

00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:29,860
worlds you're looking around it prompts

00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:32,320
you with four objects you need to find

00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,940
you need to look around all around you

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,829
essentially you're in these miniature

00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,470
worlds the levels were actually made

00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:40,389
with toys themselves because of the

00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:42,480
camera and their perspective you look

00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:46,060
like the size of like a NASCAR like a

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:49,480
little car toy or you look smaller than

00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:51,070
a doll for example there's a bunch of

00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,649
hidden objects there is a mode that you

00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:55,839
can play without a google cardboard in

00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:58,269
it so you can just basically like look

00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:04,140
around in space or you can have it up

00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:06,399
and actually be using the cardboard we

00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:08,550
you basically play through the levels

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,839
you unlock them there's different

00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:16,390
difficulties some objects are harder to

00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:23,380
find than others so really quick just so

00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:25,840
everyone there's audio and it's loud

00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:29,530
yeah

00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:31,090
um so he so basically this is Ellie from

00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,710
our office this is what this is one of

00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:34,540
our proof of concepts that we made first

00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,310
this is not the final version but the

00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,500
idea is she's like looking at two levels

00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:41,710
right now that we made in our proof of

00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:44,050
concept the TV is actually hooked up in

00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:46,840
streaming what the phone is in the

00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:48,370
cardboard right now that she's using so

00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,440
essentially you pick a level you go in

00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,060
and prompt to you with the objects that

00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,320
are there so a lot of our proof of

00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,880
concept stuff was just like how does

00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:59,410
this work how do we get a 360 degree

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,310
photo/matt to a Google cardboard app

00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:05,170
these items we had a lot of a lot of

00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:07,480
things that the designers weren't happy

00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:11,110
about that I had to polish and work on

00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,520
animations interactions but really so

00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,320
she's just looking around right now in

00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:18,690
the world right and trying to find some

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,690
of the objects that were specified there

00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,650
the actual levels themselves I didn't

00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:31,000
partake too much in it but I know the

00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:33,280
people who did the office had a lot of

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,930
fun they literally took toys and made

00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:40,890
little worlds we use this camera on the

00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:45,100
right here it's called a Ricoh theta s

00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:46,660
360 camera surprisingly are not as

00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,060
expensive as you would think there's

00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:51,400
people that put together like GoPro rig

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:54,430
where you put like 10 GoPros in a circle

00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:56,110
create these large 360 photos videos

00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,730
they're starting to come out with

00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:01,540
smaller and smaller cameras that are

00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:03,340
cheaper and cheaper so this camera just

00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,350
basically has two lenses on each side

00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:07,720
that stitches together the photo into

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:10,600
360 so really we put together these

00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,730
little levels with toys and then

00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,350
essentially just put the camera in the

00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,300
middle of the level and took a lot of

00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:17,920
different trying to do a lot of figuring

00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,390
out which objects in the photos are

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,820
going to be the ones that the user was

00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:23,710
going to have to find making sure that

00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,140
things were the right distance away from

00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:28,240
the camera meant our design team have to

00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:31,150
play around with toys for a week or more

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,580
they had a lot of fun so we had a lot of

00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:35,520
different themes some of them got pretty

00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:38,640
elaborate this one on the left is like

00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:44,700
different landmarks of the world

00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:46,260
one so that was a lot of fun playing

00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,360
levels together we tried a few different

00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:51,840
types of concepts until we landed on

00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:54,630
this one called Dino war which was

00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:57,330
dinosaurs versus army men and that was

00:14:54,630 --> 00:15:00,210
when it clicked that having themed toys

00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:02,940
and being in this miniature world was

00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:04,770
was a lot of fun and so once we got that

00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,540
first one down then we just started

00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:11,160
getting kind of sets of toys and setting

00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:13,050
up these setting up these levels so tiny

00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:16,160
I kind of look a little overview of the

00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:20,310
architecture the backend the API is

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:23,280
Python 3.4 Jenga 1.9 we use Django rest

00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:25,830
framework for the AP is for unity we use

00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:29,280
unity 5 which is the latest version we

00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:31,860
use C sharp not JavaScript you're able

00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,690
to use both in unity and at first I was

00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,610
like well out of the two I guess right

00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,200
now I'm going to pick JavaScript and I

00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:39,600
quickly stopped and switch back to

00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,130
c-sharp there is some concerns about you

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,170
writing code in JavaScript and

00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:45,420
integrating with other plugins or other

00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:47,610
code that you're using that's using C

00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:50,460
sharp especially like an order of

00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:52,230
execution and if you want one that needs

00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,050
to important another one there seem to

00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,800
be a lot of complexities and a lot of

00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,450
example code and stuff you're going to

00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,770
find on github and what not is all

00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:03,270
written in C sharp so I took the plunge

00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:06,600
we use postgres for the database on the

00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:09,390
back end we did deploy it cross-platform

00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,310
through unity which means we built it

00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:13,920
for both iOS and Android and deployed it

00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:16,770
on both stores and we use Google

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,230
cardboards unity SDK that's essentially

00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:20,820
the thing that helps make it run on the

00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:24,510
phone and show you those two different

00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:27,840
eyes which I'll talk about more later so

00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:29,490
some other services use some we got to

00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:32,550
use a lot of other common stuff that we

00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,750
use on most of our other apps so fabric

00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,910
we have some like Twitter integration

00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:38,550
but specifically we use their statistics

00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:40,920
reporting and crashlytics so they fabric

00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:42,780
has an integration with unity we use it

00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:46,050
also on our iPhone apps for example our

00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:48,990
Android apps for error monitoring push

00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:50,250
push for push notifications we use a lot

00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,110
of just unity

00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:54,720
he has a whole unity services section so

00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:57,660
we use one for in-app purchases that

00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,300
they have and then we use century for

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:06,660
any error reporting on our API on the

00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:12,270
back end alright so quickly talking

00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:15,120
about just VR in unity unity basically

00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:16,910
is making a big push to include virtual

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,410
reality just as part of the platform

00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:21,240
trying to have a very much a batteries

00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:23,120
included type approach unity is all

00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,470
about craft cross-platform development

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,190
you try to create your game and it's

00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:31,350
going to work on many platforms so right

00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:35,930
now it has built in virtual reality of

00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:37,800
support for rift vive gear PlayStation

00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,330
cardboards basically only one who

00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,980
doesn't have built-in support for it's

00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:44,460
coming soon instead you just have to

00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:47,190
download SDK from google that you just

00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:49,080
put into your unity project but it's

00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:52,530
essentially the same as building your 3d

00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:54,390
game the key differences are thinking

00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:56,970
about the controls and the inputs are

00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:59,790
quite different then maybe someone using

00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:02,100
a mouse and a keyboard for example and

00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:03,840
it's really all about thinking about the

00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:08,310
person with their headset on and that

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:10,920
the camera in your game is really the

00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:12,450
person's head and so there's a lot it's

00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,370
really the key to just thinking about

00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:17,460
virtual reality game development for me

00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:18,330
and unity so really what we saw is

00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,900
you've got the two different

00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:23,910
perspectives for each eye and really the

00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,530
it's all about this camera objects that

00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:27,270
you create in unity in it and it has a

00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:29,490
different camera for both your left and

00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:31,560
right I virtual reality works by just

00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:34,410
offsetting what each of those eyes are

00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:37,380
seen to give a perception of depth in

00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:39,540
the virtual reality world so Google

00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,030
cardboard comes with this camera object

00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:44,370
that you just use and unity these

00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:46,200
pre-built objects are called prefabs so

00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:48,660
there's this camera prefab that you can

00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,310
just use and it's also key for if

00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,740
there's things in the UI that need to

00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:54,450
always appear in front of the users gaze

00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,220
and where they're looking so for example

00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,470
if you want to have some kind of cursor

00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:01,290
or Target or reticle in front of the

00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:03,040
user you can apply that to the camera

00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:06,520
and just make sure it's always

00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:08,860
x whatever units of measure you want to

00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,740
say in front of where the user is

00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:15,970
looking so it's kind of key about how to

00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:17,500
think about virtual reality development

00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,510
how it differs from regular game

00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,720
development unity the other the other

00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:26,620
issues we came across it seems if we

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,870
were want to port this game to a gear or

00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:31,630
dive or rift right now it doesn't seem

00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:34,210
super straightforward to build one game

00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:37,240
and then have it build for playstation

00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:39,130
rift five gear and cardboard I think

00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,380
maybe unities ultimate goal is to get

00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,400
there but right now we definitely we

00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,530
definitely looked at how unity was

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,510
working and we picked cardboard and so

00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,400
if you were to try to make a game I

00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:51,070
think you're going to want to pick one

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,380
to start with and worry about making it

00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:56,110
cross V our platform that's a phrase

00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:59,860
later because the inputs and controls

00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:01,720
differ greatly for cardboard you can

00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,690
like I said deploy to both Android and

00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:07,030
iPhone the trick is for unity a lot of

00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:09,100
it you have to pay for all the different

00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:10,660
add-ons and plugins so worth noting if

00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,430
your end goal is to end up deploying

00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,350
this on to one of the stores you're

00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:16,060
going to have to be paying for unity pro

00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:18,730
and your have to be paying for both the

00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,890
iphone and the android add on if you

00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:22,660
want us if you want to deploy to both so

00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:24,310
it's a caveat you can actually wait to

00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:26,400
purchase all those things right until

00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:30,030
you're about to deploy on the App Store

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:34,360
tip if that's what you're thinking about

00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:41,410
alright so quiz time so on your device

00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:43,810
of choice go to you kahoots dot it is

00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:45,250
going to be an interesting exercise I

00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:51,810
can't control the volume so this might

00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:51,810
be really loud my apologies all right

00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,670
you

00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:05,340
so I've asked you for the game pin so

00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,340
we're going to do is top two people i

00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:12,879
will ship some google cardboards to so

00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:14,379
not only does it count there's only five

00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:16,539
questions you got 20 seconds to answer

00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:18,970
each question but points are not only

00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:21,100
about getting the answer correctly it's

00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:23,289
about getting it the quickest so we're

00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:28,450
not going to end up with like 20 people

00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:30,789
all getting all five questions right all

00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:38,309
right how are we doing anyone need more

00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:38,309
time huh

00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,200
yeah yeah

00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:50,740
alright alright I think we're gonna

00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:57,780
start we're gonna start it's we're

00:21:50,740 --> 00:22:11,559
sewing names are still coming I don't we

00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:14,140
are all right we're starting no all

00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:17,740
right which headset has the least amount

00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:27,400
of inputs so you got to click the right

00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:31,770
corresponding answer on your device we

00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,770
didn't even need 20 seconds on top of it

00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:38,289
cardboard it's only got the one button

00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:41,080
everything else at least has controllers

00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:44,770
even the Samsung gear has multiple

00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:47,740
buttons and a touchpad on the side the

00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:49,030
one the one button on cardboard makes it

00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,510
kind of really difficult to make any

00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:59,440
complex VR interaction all right there's

00:22:52,510 --> 00:23:01,450
a top-five be be slick and Dane all

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,289
right next question which headset is not

00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,289
yet released

00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:29,740
two people didn't answer PlayStation

00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:33,520
doesn't come out until October it's the

00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:37,090
last one to release this year out of the

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:41,410
major ones people mostly pay attention

00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:47,130
beasts like still up there but tech tour

00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:47,130
came in second what does MLP stand for I

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,140
quickly googled MLP when I was putting

00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:58,919
answers together for this one guess

00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:58,919
which one came up when I googled MLP

00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:12,789
yeah trying to trick people on this one

00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:19,059
read carefully yeah minimum minimum

00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:22,690
lovable products now be slick still just

00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:24,700
Asian everyone out all right two

00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:30,789
questions left which is not a reason why

00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:34,480
we went with google cardboard which is

00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:36,690
not a reason we wait with google

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,690
cardboard

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,140
they're supposed to be sound right now

00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:52,039
I'm really disappointed there's not any

00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:54,799
oh so his revenue we weren't trying to

00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:56,210
make money it was it was a little bit a

00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,770
little bit of a trick because maybe you

00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:59,240
thought well there's bigger audience and

00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:00,980
maybe that means more revenue but the

00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,179
apps actually free there is like an

00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,750
in-app purchase for a couple extra

00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:08,720
levels but no one's really bought that

00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:11,750
so and we we didn't plan on making any

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,010
money we did go google cardboard because

00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,049
of the game mechanics there's only one

00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:16,549
but in our app was pretty simple it was

00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:21,830
actually just mostly around looking at

00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:26,330
stuff so that wasn't oh no how be slick

00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:28,010
what happened last question it really

00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:30,289
might be anyone's anyone's game at this

00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:32,559
point a google cardboard costs about how

00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:32,559
much

00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:49,690
oh man

00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:57,700
$15 cheapest cardboard $15 there might

00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,989
be some that are thirty-eight dollars or

00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:02,799
more a little bit of trick question

00:25:58,989 --> 00:26:11,470
there people get it all right Charlie

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:15,009
and roller our winners sorry Harley and

00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:18,519
older all right just come see me after

00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:28,389
the talk and I'll get your yeah it's

00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:30,340
this beast like want us yeah all right

00:26:28,389 --> 00:26:34,570
that was great how does a good halfway

00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:38,950
through the talk everyone's got sleepy

00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:42,190
from lunch you know ah ok so that's a

00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:43,499
little intro to VR hopefully got some

00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:46,600
understanding of the different headsets

00:26:43,499 --> 00:26:50,649
unity integration unity what you're

00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:53,350
getting into so for the next 20-25

00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:54,759
minutes I want to talk about and get

00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:59,789
into some code samples of how we

00:26:54,759 --> 00:27:02,499
integrated unity with an API and Django

00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:03,759
apologies i have a feeling some of the

00:27:02,499 --> 00:27:06,759
code may be a little hard to read

00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:11,340
because the aspect ratio but we'll see

00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:14,230
so who has used the RF before imagined

00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:18,489
ok so maybe seventy-five percent of the

00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:20,409
room i'm not going to go too much into

00:27:18,489 --> 00:27:24,239
drf i'm going to just show some of our

00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:26,129
code our drf implementation is a pretty

00:27:24,239 --> 00:27:31,090
straightforward we're not doing anything

00:27:26,129 --> 00:27:33,340
super unique so why do we even need an

00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:35,710
API for a game right you might be asking

00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:38,859
yourself that question there's level

00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:41,350
packs there's levels in each level pack

00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:44,049
and then each level has a bunch of

00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:46,090
hidden objects that you need to find so

00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:47,859
we wanted to create an API one because

00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:49,600
we want to be able to add new levels and

00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:52,450
level packs without having a ship and

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,769
new updates to the app store because

00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:55,179
that's a painful process sometimes

00:27:53,769 --> 00:27:58,840
anyone's been through that they've been

00:27:55,179 --> 00:28:00,700
trying to get make it better we found

00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:03,460
through testing that some of our objects

00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,799
were too easy or too hard to find so we

00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:07,779
wanted the ability to actually change

00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:10,119
the objects the people we're looking for

00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:12,909
in the level without having to push an

00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:15,159
update after we did some testing we

00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:16,629
wanted to store asset bundles I'm going

00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:18,340
to talk about that in a little bit but

00:28:16,629 --> 00:28:20,409
we wanted to essentially store a bunch

00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:23,889
of the pictures and images and sound

00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:25,539
clips on s3 so that they just get

00:28:23,889 --> 00:28:27,129
downloaded to the phone and when you

00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:29,799
download the app you're not downloading

00:28:27,129 --> 00:28:31,509
this hundreds of megabytes app when you

00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:33,369
first download the app you download a

00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:35,139
small app and it downloads the assets as

00:28:33,369 --> 00:28:38,049
you play the levels and not all of them

00:28:35,139 --> 00:28:40,299
at once for in-app purchases we want an

00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:42,609
API so that we can set up identifiers

00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:44,679
for the level packs that we're setting

00:28:42,609 --> 00:28:46,749
up in the app in the App Store so

00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:48,580
essentially in google play in the apple

00:28:46,749 --> 00:28:50,830
app store we can create a new app in app

00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:52,539
purchase for a new level pack create a

00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:54,759
whole new level pack with levels and

00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:57,279
hidden objects all without pushing and

00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:58,840
update and a little bit of future

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,850
proofing there could be more

00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,359
complications around actual user

00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:05,619
accounts or other things in the future

00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:10,409
normal reasons why you might need to

00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:13,029
have a back end to your game so our

00:29:10,409 --> 00:29:15,609
models pretty straightforward I have

00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:17,379
left out a bunch of the fields but I

00:29:15,609 --> 00:29:18,759
kept in the ones I felt were most

00:29:17,379 --> 00:29:21,399
important for just talking through this

00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:24,580
so like I was saying we have level packs

00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:26,739
each level pack has multiple levels each

00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:30,759
level has multiple hidden objects that

00:29:26,739 --> 00:29:34,029
you're finding in the game so and the

00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:37,330
key here also is that we store these

00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:38,679
asset bundle names which again just keep

00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:41,080
them in your minds we're also on our

00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:44,230
model storing essentially these asset

00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:47,289
bundles and the links to s3 we also play

00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:49,629
music so we also store an audio clip for

00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:52,749
each level for the hidden objects we

00:29:49,629 --> 00:29:55,840
actually store where the objects are in

00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:58,059
space in the game so if you notice we

00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,919
have fields in there for scale and

00:29:58,059 --> 00:30:02,470
position that's so that when we actually

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,359
load up the level we put the object in

00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:11,259
the level based on the data coming from

00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:13,419
the API really this is our main endpoint

00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:16,059
from the back end which is just given a

00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:19,470
list of level packs I don't think I left

00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:19,470
anything out here this is really it

00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:25,360
yeah it returns a list of our level bags

00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,860
the serializers again we just have a

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,330
bunch of nested sterilizers so

00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:30,250
essentially what this means is when we

00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:32,290
send out all the level packs we are

00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:34,360
sending down all of the levels and all

00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:36,400
the hidden objects at the same time it's

00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,590
not a lot of data we could have done it

00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,120
so you get a list of the level pack so

00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:42,400
when you click on a level pack then you

00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,200
see all the levels then we make another

00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,300
API request didn't really seem necessary

00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:52,120
it's really not that much information to

00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:54,730
send down at once we have we do have an

00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:57,490
API key permission on the endpoints

00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:59,380
really there's nothing secure a private

00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:00,970
though about this endpoint whatsoever we

00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:03,540
did it maybe in the future there'd be

00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:05,890
something there so really this is pretty

00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:07,990
pretty transparent maybe not the most

00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:09,850
secure but more or less our endpoints

00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:13,450
you need to pass it the correct API key

00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:16,750
start that API key in our settings maybe

00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:19,240
that should even be and then that API

00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:21,400
key obviously is also stored in unity on

00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:25,540
our iPhone and Android builds that are

00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:29,410
compiled and then we just configure that

00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:30,820
one URL with the router so the drink of

00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:33,100
rest framework again try not to give a

00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,960
tutorial but at least quick our models

00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,940
key thing this thing about level packs

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,800
level packs have levels levels have

00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:40,930
hidden objects they all contain the data

00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:44,880
that we need for the game to kind of

00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:44,880
dynamically create some of those scenes

00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:53,160
so let's talk about how it works with

00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:55,690
unity so when you first open up the app

00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,010
unlike the proof of concept we decided

00:31:55,690 --> 00:32:00,520
when you first open the app up you're

00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:02,920
actually greeted with a 2d list of all

00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:04,420
the levels originally we thought well

00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,190
what if you're just in VR the whole time

00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:07,540
and you pick the level with Google

00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:10,180
cardboard there's actually even more

00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:12,100
fatigued with the basically with

00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:14,020
smartphone VR there's even more fatigued

00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:16,090
by users than if they have the full head

00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:18,520
set on because of the screen door affect

00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:20,350
people getting more nauseous you have to

00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,650
actually hold the cardboard up to your

00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:25,870
head it's not strapped so you look at

00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,850
all the level packs you look at the

00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:29,830
levels you select the level to play then

00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:31,870
you go into virtual reality to play the

00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:33,610
game from there you can play a couple

00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:35,050
levels in a row until we kick you back

00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:37,300
out and you come back to these screens

00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:39,700
so essentially this first screen makes

00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:41,680
an API request gets the list of all the

00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:44,020
level packs we show them in a list in

00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:46,750
unity and then there's a little bit of

00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:48,880
logic on the phone to figure out if you

00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:52,150
downloaded the assets for those levels

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:55,270
yet if you need to purchase it or if you

00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:56,800
can just play the level pack and so

00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:59,050
really all that happens here is that

00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:05,559
download button changes to one of those

00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:07,900
three words depending so I spent a lot

00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:11,010
of time trying to figure out from unity

00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:14,590
how to actually make an API request and

00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:18,730
get the JSON data and be able to use it

00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:20,679
easily in our app surprisingly it's not

00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:22,960
that easy and what I'm going to show you

00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:25,059
is going to look really easy but don't

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,240
let that fool you it's a week's of

00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:30,730
figuring out the right package and how

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,800
it's supposed to work so an issue with

00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:35,350
unity development and specifically

00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:38,410
compiling to iphone and android is that

00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:41,350
there's certain there's certain c sharp

00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:43,960
dotnet libraries in the core library

00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:45,940
that won't work on android and iphone so

00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,040
there are some built-in libraries that

00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:50,140
help make networking calls that

00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:52,900
unfortunately won't actually work on

00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:55,030
your mobile phone so that's a huge thing

00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:58,020
that wasn't very obvious when starting

00:33:55,030 --> 00:34:00,910
out with unity once i figured this out

00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:03,309
did some reading i started to look at

00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:05,800
what alternatives there are other

00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:07,750
libraries of like well this was python

00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,950
and django i'd be looking at other

00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:10,330
people do and look at other blogs

00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:13,720
looking at github and getting some

00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:16,090
examples I felt that there was there's a

00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:20,530
little bit of a lack of that community

00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:22,419
fuel in unity development and I ended up

00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:24,700
finding this one library after trying a

00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:26,740
few others that also didn't work some of

00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:30,010
them also dependent on xamarin which is

00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:32,980
another kind of cross-platform library I

00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:34,030
landed on best HTTP the name also threw

00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,510
me off a little bit I was like is this

00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:39,550
really going to be the best library that

00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:44,080
that calls itself best HTTP but it was

00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:45,440
um so maybe they knew maybe maybe the

00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,899
person who first made

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:51,290
library is like I'm going to make the

00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:53,329
best one so you actually have to

00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:56,060
purchase this through the unity asset

00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:59,119
store so at first my initial reaction

00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:01,190
was like there's a store to buy stuff in

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,400
unity other people made this seems like

00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:06,500
this different than what I'm used to

00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:09,740
eventually though I mean I think this

00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:11,300
was maybe there's also a best HTTP light

00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,800
and pro version I'm not honestly sure

00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,240
with the differences were but I think

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,440
one was thirty dollars and the other was

00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,770
sixty dollars and then you can just use

00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,690
it forever in your game comparing back

00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:22,760
to the already weeks of time i had spent

00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:25,760
like trying to figure out how to use

00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:28,430
other libraries or just c sharp in

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,160
the.net libraries itself definitely

00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:32,660
worth that the time so i purchase it

00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,400
through the asset store it kind of like

00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:36,880
downloads into your app and then you can

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,960
use it and it was great the only

00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:44,869
problems i have with it is that the

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:46,520
documentation is just a google doc it's

00:35:44,869 --> 00:35:50,359
not great i just say the documentation

00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:52,460
is not great stuff stuff to be improved

00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:54,280
there but so really quick I mean you

00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:57,500
probably already glance the code once i

00:35:54,280 --> 00:36:00,589
found best HTTP they actually finally

00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:04,190
make my my API request was super

00:36:00,589 --> 00:36:06,619
straightforward i give it the uri

00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:10,190
essentially the URL to the API endpoint

00:36:06,619 --> 00:36:14,089
that I'm calling HTTP request is an

00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:17,060
object from best HTTP it's a class so I

00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:19,670
you instantiate HTTP request with the

00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:21,410
URL that your API is going to and a

00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:23,420
callback function so that when the API

00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:26,240
returns that function is called with

00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:29,510
your data base HTTP seem to also have a

00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,119
bunch of advanced functionality for web

00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:34,990
sockets obviously making rest calls for

00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:37,880
all the different verbs post get delete

00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:40,010
it seemed really fully featured once I

00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,210
started to dig into it which is great so

00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:43,160
this is pretty straightforward this is

00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:46,690
all it ended up taking one's finding the

00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,690
right tools but together

00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:52,550
so this other thing full serializer I'm

00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:55,310
not going to go through what this is per

00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:58,040
se but the idea is from other

00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:59,990
experiences on iphone and android and in

00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:03,080
javascript when we're calling our end

00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:06,130
point i want to take that JSON data on

00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:08,960
my client and I want to turn that into

00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:11,000
actual objects that have that data and

00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,450
so on a lot of other platforms there's

00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,730
libraries and ways to kind of automates

00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:18,140
d like deserialising your JSON data into

00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:20,630
actual objects whatever programming

00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:22,280
language you're writing in so I was

00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:23,780
looking for something similar in unity

00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,880
so I could just have some C sharp

00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:28,369
objects I that I actually had a level

00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:31,220
object and I had a level pack object

00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:33,080
that had a bunch of levels so this is

00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:35,240
just up here for reference later this is

00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:37,490
a class that you put together I think

00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:40,130
it's partly in the full serializer

00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:42,230
documentation this is just a github repo

00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:46,490
with some open source software that you

00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:48,380
can use he's actually using it though so

00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:50,839
this is that call back again on request

00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:54,470
finished that sends back the data once

00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:56,390
best HTTP has returned so if I call that

00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:59,630
other class I just showed you the

00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:02,900
deserialize method I say hey here's the

00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:05,570
data that best HTTP got back here's my

00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:10,190
level pack object which I show you below

00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:12,230
here just deserialize all that JSON into

00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:14,839
this object for me and then give me back

00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:16,160
a list of level packs and that's great

00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:18,170
and that's more used to what I'm doing

00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,030
in some of our other like thin client

00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:22,609
platforms that are calling the API and

00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:24,800
so like this level pack class that I

00:38:22,609 --> 00:38:32,000
have below we also have one for a level

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:34,310
and one for hidden objects right um so

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,450
kind of the last part really is how do

00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:39,890
we make that final scene that's in 3d

00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:42,589
year virtual reality depending on how

00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:45,050
you're playing so that this screenshot

00:38:42,589 --> 00:38:47,119
is actually what the scene looks like in

00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:50,300
unity so the idea is that we have this

00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:52,790
very bare-bones scene that has some of

00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:54,589
our UI set up and from the data that's

00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:56,810
coming from the API about that specific

00:38:54,589 --> 00:38:59,859
level all those green cubes are going to

00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:03,160
turn into actual objects somewhere

00:38:59,859 --> 00:39:04,539
the seen the like the level name is

00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,519
going to turn into the actual level name

00:39:04,539 --> 00:39:08,440
coming from the API and all those white

00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:10,119
squares and that menu actually turn into

00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,650
little icons of the objects you're

00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:13,059
supposed to be finding as well as their

00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:16,599
name so all this data is coming from the

00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:18,759
API so originally we had we had a we had

00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:21,039
like six different scenes with all of

00:39:18,759 --> 00:39:24,039
this hard coded in there and as a

00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:26,019
programmer I was like I feel like I'm

00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:27,730
repeating myself over and over again

00:39:26,019 --> 00:39:30,190
right now and so it made a lot of sense

00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:32,440
to kind of abstract it out put it into

00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:33,940
an API and have these levels dynamically

00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,009
load and it's like this took me a while

00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:40,589
i talked to another like experience

00:39:36,009 --> 00:39:42,690
unity developer about the problems and

00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:45,009
so this is what we ended up with

00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:47,950
specifically also to note to the the

00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:51,099
photos are just these 360 degree photos

00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:53,619
that are maps to the sphere if you will

00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:55,299
around the camera so in this picture

00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:57,279
right here the kind of the white tiled

00:39:55,299 --> 00:40:00,400
background all of that gets replaced

00:39:57,279 --> 00:40:03,039
with a 360 degree photo that was taken

00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,690
inside of the miniature world the green

00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:08,829
cubes are actually just invisible

00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:11,319
they're placed in the scene over where

00:40:08,829 --> 00:40:13,239
that object essentially exists on the

00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:16,150
photosphere so it's not like we're

00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:18,759
actually taking a 3d model of an army

00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:20,109
man and putting it in there this cube we

00:40:18,759 --> 00:40:21,940
actually just changed the shape and the

00:40:20,109 --> 00:40:25,480
size so that it overlaps on the

00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:30,160
photosphere with where that object is in

00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:32,049
the image so the key here are these

00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,930
asset bundles which again was this whole

00:40:32,049 --> 00:40:36,069
concept that seemed very overwhelming at

00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:39,039
first because I had never dealt with

00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:41,109
something like this so the game assets

00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:43,210
are really large the photo spheres in

00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:45,519
the game are really large and if someone

00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:47,349
had download all of these at one time

00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:49,809
and all the sound clips and everything

00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:51,130
it would they'd have to be on Wi-Fi to

00:40:49,809 --> 00:40:53,109
download it they'd be downloading

00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:55,089
everything if they only played one level

00:40:53,109 --> 00:40:56,499
they have a ton of assets and taking up

00:40:55,089 --> 00:40:58,359
a ton of space on their phone that

00:40:56,499 --> 00:40:59,950
they're not even using so the idea is

00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:01,509
for them to be able to download assets

00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:03,309
on demand when they need to it also

00:41:01,509 --> 00:41:05,200
gives us the ability to update assets

00:41:03,309 --> 00:41:08,380
maybe we found there as a mistake with

00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:10,869
one of the photo spheres in the level we

00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:14,059
could re-up load our asset bundles to s3

00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:16,789
the asset bundle manager essentially

00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:18,499
also has another schema file that has

00:41:16,789 --> 00:41:20,719
some meta information about what version

00:41:18,499 --> 00:41:22,599
of this asset bundle it is so the game

00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:24,949
can actually detect hey there's new

00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:26,569
asset bundles to be downloaded and will

00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:29,089
prompt the user to download the new one

00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:30,859
and throw out the old one and these

00:41:29,089 --> 00:41:32,779
asset bundles can actually contain all

00:41:30,859 --> 00:41:34,849
different things they can contain

00:41:32,779 --> 00:41:36,319
essentially just an image they could

00:41:34,849 --> 00:41:39,259
contain a whole scene so you could

00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:40,999
actually create a whole new scene be

00:41:39,259 --> 00:41:43,279
able to change it kind of on the fly

00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:45,529
upload it to your server in this bundled

00:41:43,279 --> 00:41:46,910
up package and the game would be able to

00:41:45,529 --> 00:41:48,319
download it so a lot of the games if you

00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:51,049
ever played on your phone are doing

00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:56,239
things like this interestingly Pokemon

00:41:51,049 --> 00:41:59,479
go has made in unity fun fact so a

00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:01,969
little bit about the asset bundles for

00:41:59,479 --> 00:42:03,739
my time is up so there's a whole asset

00:42:01,969 --> 00:42:06,619
bundle tutorial I've got some links on

00:42:03,739 --> 00:42:08,089
in a couple slides so unity has all

00:42:06,619 --> 00:42:10,489
these example projects on how to use

00:42:08,089 --> 00:42:11,509
asset bundles and whatnot but I am just

00:42:10,489 --> 00:42:13,759
going to show you a little bit of code

00:42:11,509 --> 00:42:15,199
that might make some of it easier

00:42:13,759 --> 00:42:17,779
because they show a lot going on there

00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:21,859
and it's helpful to just see it actually

00:42:17,779 --> 00:42:23,539
used so asset bundle utility this class

00:42:21,859 --> 00:42:25,969
is actually a class that's provided by

00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:28,069
unity they give you that you can

00:42:25,969 --> 00:42:29,749
download through the asset store but for

00:42:28,069 --> 00:42:32,599
free from unity is this whole asset

00:42:29,749 --> 00:42:34,279
bundle package utility is a class in

00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:35,630
there that try to help it helps manage

00:42:34,279 --> 00:42:36,529
the versioning and all this other stuff

00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:39,109
that you don't have to write yourself

00:42:36,529 --> 00:42:41,509
which makes a lot of sense this function

00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:44,779
here is specifically about us loading

00:42:41,509 --> 00:42:47,449
the photosphere so in unity terms that

00:42:44,779 --> 00:42:50,569
photo sphere is a material that material

00:42:47,449 --> 00:42:52,669
is applied to this sphere that is around

00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:54,019
the camera so what we're trying to do is

00:42:52,669 --> 00:42:57,919
we're trying to get from the asset

00:42:54,019 --> 00:43:01,309
bundle asynchronously the material that

00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:04,130
we're then going to put on to the sphere

00:43:01,309 --> 00:43:06,679
in our scene so at first we use asset

00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:09,319
bundle manager to load an asset

00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:11,539
asynchronously you give it the asset

00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:14,539
bundle name in the asset name so we

00:43:11,539 --> 00:43:18,079
create one asset bundle for every level

00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:19,819
pack and each level knows the name the

00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:22,400
nose and names of its assets in that

00:43:19,819 --> 00:43:23,850
bundle so it was a better strategy than

00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,500
having a different asset but

00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:27,780
for every level because if you noticed

00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:29,310
on our first level select screen we

00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:31,350
prompt you to download a whole level

00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:34,050
pack so it made more sense for the whole

00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:36,600
pack to be an SF bundle and it contains

00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:39,000
the assets for each level those levels

00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:40,920
from our API know what their name or the

00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,800
names are of those assets in the bundle

00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:47,670
so we load this asynchronously once it

00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:50,460
comes back this I enumerator in front of

00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:51,600
the name of the method essentially the

00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:54,540
notice that this function can be run

00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:58,770
asynchronously as a koto team in co

00:43:54,540 --> 00:44:02,520
routine and unity so when it returns we

00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:04,560
get a material from the request to the

00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:07,110
asset bundle manager and then we can

00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:09,390
just put that material onto our mesh

00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:11,040
renderer which is you get into unity

00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:12,480
mesh renderer is just the thing that's

00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:17,280
attached to the sphere that actually

00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:19,680
renders the picture so in our actual

00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,990
code once all at once i created this

00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:26,400
function inside of unities asset bundle

00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:28,020
utility I would then just call off i

00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,190
would start start a new co routine which

00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:32,640
means basically call this method

00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:34,200
asynchronously because in games often

00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,210
you don't want to you you don't want to

00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,530
block the game because you'll the user

00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:40,040
will just get this black screen

00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:42,360
especially if you're in virtual reality

00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:43,980
you would cause your user to get stick

00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:46,530
immediately if all of a sudden there

00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:48,600
you're there in some virtual world you

00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:51,150
pause the game and it shows black

00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,680
because you're loading assets in you

00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:55,800
need to think a lot about probably

00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:57,750
preloading assets so that they have a

00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,910
continuous smooth experience and you're

00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:01,980
not jarring them with like a loading

00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:04,830
screen virtual reality or flashing some

00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:07,050
black back to like a new world things

00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:09,000
like that you need to be careful of so

00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:11,640
here we just give it the asset bundle

00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,370
name of the level pack we give it the

00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:16,970
name of the photosphere asset itself

00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:20,430
that might be like Dino Ward photosphere

00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:22,770
and then the actual renderer that we're

00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:28,020
using in our current scene that we're

00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:30,930
loading so a bunch of resources that you

00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:33,630
can use so specifically I learned a

00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:34,830
bunch of my unit EVR stuff by watching

00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:37,950
this udemy you

00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:39,570
DVR tutorial it is really great it seems

00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:41,550
even since I've watched it they've added

00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:44,400
a ton of content and isn't it it looks

00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:47,310
like they've added content also for rift

00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:50,850
and gear VR as well on top of the

00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:53,010
cardboard stuff that was in there there

00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:54,570
is a specific github repo I looked at

00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:56,970
about how to actually map photospheres

00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:59,370
to a 360-degree world in Google

00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:03,930
cardboard that was super helpful a link

00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:05,220
to best HTTP full serializer I recommend

00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:07,860
if you're getting involved that you just

00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:09,660
open up Google cardboards example unity

00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:11,490
project and just click around and

00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:14,850
explore that's how I figured out a lot

00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:17,010
of what was going on the Ricoh theta s

00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:18,330
is the camera that we used if you

00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:19,770
probably wait even longer they'll be

00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:22,380
they'll be cheaper ones that are coming

00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:25,410
out and then the unique cardboard

00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:27,780
tutorial Unity's got a bunch of

00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:29,400
tutorials themselves and videos as well

00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:31,110
video walkthroughs if you like to learn

00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:34,830
that way and then the asset bundle

00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:38,100
manager and that's it so these slides

00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:39,690
are up at that URL if you want to go

00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:42,930
back here all those are actual links

00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:45,600
that you can click on to go to there um

00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:47,880
that's it I got some I got five minutes

00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:50,580
for questions pretty awesome what you

00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:53,660
did there um will this scale well when

00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:57,360
you have like say a million users um

00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:59,220
right now yeah because really the API

00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:02,220
interaction is just when someone opens

00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:04,350
up the app there's no because there's no

00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:06,510
ongoing while you're playing the game it

00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:10,950
would be concerning if for example we

00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:13,260
were like saving scores or achievements

00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:14,340
or whatnot but still it's not super

00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:16,110
complicated you were just need to make

00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:18,270
sure that you were scaling your servers

00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:21,360
well enough to handle the traffic hey

00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:23,700
why did you choose to to query for all

00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:25,530
the level data from a server rather than

00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:31,200
just bundle that data into an object in

00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:33,000
the asset bundle so if we went that

00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:36,950
route that means when the app opens

00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:39,930
before anything happens it needs to

00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:41,790
the app needs to have a hard-coded URL

00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:44,400
of where to go to get the asset bundle

00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:45,840
if that was to happen and then it would

00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,300
need to check the version of that asset

00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:52,380
bundle and download it and then figure

00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:54,330
out the data and there our idea was the

00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:56,670
API would also grow into more than just

00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:58,440
having the information for the scene but

00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:07,250
that's about as possibility it's a way

00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:07,250
