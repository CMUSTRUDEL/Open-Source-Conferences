Title: DjangoCon US 2016 - From Developer to Manager by Sean O'Connor

Description: 
	From Developer to Manager by Sean O'Connor

As developers move along in their career, they are often encouraged to take on roles that involve more and more people management and less code.

Stepping towards management often can be a good move to make, but it is not one that should be taken lightly. If such a move is taken without a full appreciation for what it truly is (a career change), it can lead to woe and misery for all involved.

In this talk we'll follow one developer's journey from coding 40 hours/week to primarily managing humans. What worked well, what didn't work well, what was hard, and what was surprising.

Attendees of this talk should expect to walk away with a better idea of if they may be suited for management and if so, how they can successfully acclimate to their new role.

to people things down the way first up a

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,920
quick motion warning we're not going

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,349
into another horrible

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,570
Pressey everybody can see set back there

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,560
but there are some bills and there are

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,780
some animated gets any other

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,070
constituency people so that's thank for

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,820
you this point advance up so have

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,350
sometimes been over Gandhi another thing

00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,110
that tends to come up amid that he will

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,969
give a talk it's a little awkward

00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:51,239
teacher to show-and-tell a we're in

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:53,100
Italy who here has used bitly awesome

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,760
who here has any idea how we make money

00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:00,989
and you can support 90 people salaries

00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,219
great that's right here in the software

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:04,769
even my corporate didn't put their hand

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:08,820
for that so super quick answer to this

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:10,619
is we build tools for marketers to let

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,189
them see into their entropy across the

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:17,040
internet we go through lace billions and

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,750
billions of links and so normally at

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,000
this point I'd be talking about all the

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,460
servers and tribute systems and our

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,740
technicalities involved there but for

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,270
this talk this picture is walk around

00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,880
this was your company outing we did

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:34,320
about a year ago at that point I think

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:40,470
we're about 70 people we are 90 people

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:45,270
now so you know no growth but we're a

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:47,250
few things change where everybody a

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,869
little bit poor then but even more so as

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,009
you get into that range where everybody

00:01:48,869 --> 00:02:02,579
just like talking to each other making

00:01:50,009 --> 00:02:05,549
stuff work see any majors so this is

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:08,610
journey from going from developer

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:10,890
commander particular my own journeys we

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,540
say example so

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:16,310
I started out that way almost four years

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:19,050
ago I was a full-time engineer right

00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,580
responsibilities was happily coming into

00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,860
work right so code building stuff

00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,930
shipping south it's great and every so

00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,510
often things are complicated because of

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,590
fire drills you know as long as I have

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,120
to often to be honest they can be a

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:34,260
little fun right it's excitement in your

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,670
day there's good um from there started

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,050
giving a bit of mentorship right look at

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,130
that point I've been in industry for a

00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,160
while had a bit more experience than

00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:42,709
building people my team so I'm sorry to

00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,550
give some feel some guidance and support

00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:47,010
somebody started working some of the

00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,480
people on our day science team helping

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,030
them understand that we can't afford to

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,200
take the entire internet in memory maybe

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,160
there's some other options so you look

00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,410
out for the production version of

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,730
something so you even doing that your

00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:02,550
ship that's why I'm something I enjoyed

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:10,830
teaching and about hearing and things

00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:13,320
got so and it's basically dynamical

00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,730
choice I was probably more senior people

00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,260
on my team and I surprised the person

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,870
who had the most interesting going into

00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,090
a leadership app so was given an option

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,890
and you know say keep on taking work

00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,750
choice this is a big deal and there's

00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,510
been no first lessons were laying along

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,340
the ways becoming a managers of choice

00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:31,200
if for you it is not a choice in that

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,480
like you're just put into the role and

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,250
nobody asks you so giant red flagging

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,700
you should run away tension please

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,590
screaming because that's a really big

00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,400
warning sign that things are doing a lot

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:46,079
for that situation if it is a choice

00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,790
which it should be it's one you should

00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:49,590
take seriously and you need to think

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,450
about it because it's gonna kind of

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,239
changing a lot it's not permanent right

00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:56,549
like it's you know you can't come back

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,780
to coding from going to engineering stop

00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:02,160
they don't like tattoo on your forehead

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,570
no code for this one right missus I mean

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,060
you think about seriously so how do we

00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:08,519
have to go about what's going to be

00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,980
different than how we make such a choice

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,569
right well to start off what you feel

00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,310
about every day

00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:14,090
change right say ideally my computer

00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,639
here's you're going to be dealing with

00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:19,009
soft fuzzy humans right and while they

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,989
can be wonderful and amazing there may

00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:22,190
be a bit less deterministic thing

00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:25,009
computers are at least in the way that

00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:27,650
we can reason about them they did an

00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:29,570
interesting you have to be a much more

00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:32,509
deliberate about what you're doing and

00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,830
that everything you do is amplify like

00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:36,110
the impact everything to do is amplify

00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:40,360
how do you present how you communicate

00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:43,280
all that has much more impact then

00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,820
perform and you're gonna be getting less

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,500
coding

00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,729
alright there are some people this might

00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,610
be fine for other people this might be

00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:51,050
ever the big deal and it's a thing you

00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,090
need to consider right so this is my

00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:55,960
github contribution graph that includes

00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:57,979
my activity a bitly on a private repo

00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,020
you see there's not a whole lot of green

00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:01,940
on there and if you look a bit closer

00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:05,060
there's entire weeks where I'm not

00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,229
committing code and that's manager this

00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,979
is actually good this is a song that I'm

00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:11,660
doing my job right so that's a thing you

00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:14,000
think about that's a thing you're okay

00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,889
with I'm looking at some a homer

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,440
timescale you don't have to think about

00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:21,530
this that or understand that this is a

00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,490
career change right and with that this

00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,310
is gonna get a lot of things that change

00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,750
with that the skills that you need to

00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,280
develop and that you need to do your job

00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,199
every day you're gonna be fundamentally

00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,570
different how you're going to prioritize

00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,919
your time and energy and effort is going

00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,820
to be different right the things that

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,620
are important to you are going to be

00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,780
different what your goals are and how

00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,740
are you going to be measured by your

00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:43,240
peers and by your organization

00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,430
and when you go through your next

00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,629
chaplains that whole process is going to

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,770
be completely different right the

00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:49,150
availability of jobs going to be

00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,379
different how the interview process is

00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,759
going to work is going to be different

00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:53,560
oh you're gonna evaluate potential

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,620
employer is going to be different that's

00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,909
all going together so how do you go

00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,889
about thinking on this right you think

00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:01,930
about it neither option is intrinsically

00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:04,509
better or worse they're just different

00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:06,939
so how do we already make this choice

00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:09,909
now we make this decision and what else

00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:11,590
when I'm saying with the the choice I

00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:14,469
thought about a lot myself and I got

00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:16,900
some really good advice from some

00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:19,449
friends and mentors and a lot of it

00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,460
basically boiled down to what is it that

00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:23,680
makes you pack right at the end of the

00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,569
day what is about your job that you love

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,750
and what is the choice that gets you

00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:29,740
more of that right this all kinds other

00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,969
things I can attack to range about

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,039
putting the end of the day right it's

00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:34,150
just what is it about your job that

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,669
makes you want to come in every day and

00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:38,529
what get you more for me personally I

00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:40,919
really enjoy working with people and I

00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:43,539
enjoy building parts that people use

00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:44,919
enjoy coding but it's more of a means to

00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:45,909
an end for me personally all right

00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:47,169
there's other people were that the

00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:50,740
pointy works have completely differently

00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:52,389
so but for me right like what a team of

00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,339
people can build and what I can build

00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:55,719
are different things and accordingly I

00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:57,339
could build more stuff final tip for the

00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:57,789
team of people it's not works I did it's

00:06:57,339 --> 00:06:59,529
fun

00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:01,990
so for me and may tends to make a choice

00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:03,370
to become animagic so but yeah so

00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:08,289
listening is becoming about a good

00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:10,719
choice for me the choices may not be for

00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:14,009
you this point in the talk if we were to

00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:14,009
go down the not imagine choice

00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:26,720
how do you get into making that change

00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:29,030
right because like just as a clutch cool

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,020
bit of logistics right okay yesterday I

00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:34,669
was a manager did I am now what right

00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:36,590
how do you go from sitting at your desk

00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:38,419
every day coding and being measured by

00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:41,599
how you deploy stuff or how much you get

00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:43,190
out shift production to making a team

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,860
people who are maybe nervous about the

00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,900
future and concerned about how things

00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,490
are going or not sure what they're doing

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,720
to people who are really excited come

00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,370
into work everyday and love what they do

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,960
right but maybe take a group of people

00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:55,960
who are maybe not super coordinated

00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,870
going love that way that's a kind of the

00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:10,099
new world looks like what do you think

00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,659
about like how do I should go about

00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:16,039
doing that at least for me at first like

00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:16,789
that that's kind of terrifying people

00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:18,830
like come on

00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:21,680
oh my big social introvert like I don't

00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:23,750
necessarily understand people so how do

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,900
I should go about doing this and then

00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:28,940
they don't really help me a lot with

00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,190
that and that really enabled a lot for

00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,870
me was listen

00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,010
and with that understand coming to

00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,659
understanding that man can it's a

00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,610
wonderful skill right I come from a

00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:40,820
little more expansively the thing that I

00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,479
know how to do is learn and just like

00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,560
anything else

00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,029
right there are certain interests for

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,770
all these new people that make maybe

00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:47,480
make them better suited to be magics but

00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,829
the end of day it's a little skill it's

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,959
something that you learn using the same

00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:53,810
tools that you learn any other skill

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,800
right and so to that end right so how do

00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,870
you go about learning skill

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,760
well start off yeah experience right so

00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,050
obviously actually doing the work of

00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,029
management is something you will learn

00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:05,089
from like anything else you will have

00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:06,680
failures and it'll be unpleasant but you

00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:08,570
learn from that make different more

00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,699
interesting gathers in the future but

00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:12,410
even before you become a manager right

00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:14,180
and have direct experience as a manager

00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:16,010
you still have relevant experience

00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,630
presumably at the point in your career

00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:22,400
where you're having

00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:24,560
become a manager you've had bosses right

00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,090
some of them have been great some of

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,760
them will have been awful the rest will

00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:30,290
be somewhere between and you can think

00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,180
that even though you're the one doing

00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,860
the management you can think back to

00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,930
what did they do that was great where

00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,460
they do that was bad what they do that

00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:39,260
might that you might be able to use what

00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,610
they do that like maybe it isn't work

00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,470
for you but maybe define a different

00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,270
version of right that's all experience

00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,190
that you going in even having never

00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:48,800
manage somebody else you can take

00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:51,260
advantage of something else that comes

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,710
up and you know I'm hesitant to call

00:09:51,260 --> 00:10:00,560
management a science is again people and

00:09:53,710 --> 00:10:02,210
science works are super figured it turns

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,750
out you're not the first person to

00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:07,700
manage other human beings we probably

00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,780
doing for at least 10,000 years Ronnie

00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,010
even have been doing it longer than that

00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:13,490
just didn't have a way to write it down

00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:14,600
write accordingly there's lots of people

00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,670
who have figured out things about

00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,170
management and then bring it down and

00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:21,710
now when you complete it and you learn

00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:26,450
from it's really pretty cool some

00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:28,370
specific resources among out there and

00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:30,800
by the pricing right Sarah poses blog

00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:32,210
with lots of great writing he did log

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,800
writing specifically about the

00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:35,660
intersection of management and

00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,540
technology and engineers right so a lot

00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:40,750
of is like applying general engineer

00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:44,360
Jeremiah principles to engineering

00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:46,490
specific works so the blocks great this

00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,960
leader almost like a summary like hey I

00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,220
know I'm great a lot of stuff over the

00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,800
years he's like the five posts you

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:54,830
really have to read and he also has two

00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:58,610
books managing humans and you know being

00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:01,400
eke what's a really good slide out with

00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:03,790
the book management specifically if it

00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,960
gets into some 201 level stuff right so

00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:08,000
it's all really good stuff I recommend

00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:11,720
you read it but maybe don't try and do

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
all of it on day one right maybe maybe

00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,540
get into it for big events you'll see

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,310
where the things he recommends in Slovak

00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:21,110
another more general management tool

00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:23,900
that's been super helpful to me and I'm

00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:25,910
amazed is they put out for Aquinas

00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,070
is manju cool calm this is a company

00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:30,230
that does a lot of like impersonal

00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:32,090
management training but they put out ton

00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:34,010
of their content out online for free so

00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:37,070
they have a great podcast we're like 15

00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:39,200
20 min talk chunks where they just take

00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,970
on a topic and then give some really

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,290
good background advice on it they also

00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,820
have the thing that's probably

00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:45,590
impossible to see on these projectors

00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,810
you go to the website they have

00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:50,570
something pull it back of the universe

00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:51,980
and this map has like if you're if

00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,840
you're coming into something as a

00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,640
manager and like well I don't know how

00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,020
to deal with this you can probably find

00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,300
it the map of the universe and off about

00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:02,120
15 to 20 minute plotted right so let's

00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,560
say you have an employee buys issues of

00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,240
absenteeism how do you have that

00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,730
conversation and constructive way how do

00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,650
you how do you deal with that I'll say

00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:11,270
you're a manager coming into an existing

00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:13,730
team how do you make that transition

00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:15,110
well how do you deal with that you know

00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:17,090
all these kind of things and you can see

00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,800
like this is just a portion of that map

00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:23,150
and they just have tons of resources on

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:25,340
there it's great so getting kind of back

00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,600
to more higher level things initiative

00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,610
be able to learn about meeting time

00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,780
experience you can find mentors and

00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:35,150
support right I was really lucky in that

00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,690
shortly after I took on the management

00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,540
role

00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:41,630
the beauty of CTO and he's been really

00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:43,100
supportive and really great guys for me

00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,420
I also had you know people I worked with

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,490
the past people I know in the industry

00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,530
were also been really great to be back

00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,790
in sport and just like learning any

00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:52,010
other skill right there's a lot that you

00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:53,900
can learn from books but it's really

00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,830
something else to be able to have to be

00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,630
able to have a conversation with

00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:58,400
somebody or to have somebody be able to

00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,540
bring another perspective to where she's

00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,030
going and give you some feedback that's

00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:04,970
really helped so seek out mentors and

00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:07,520
peers and support Samantha to learn was

00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:09,770
still that's cool you know I guess it so

00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,210
much like we're okay you can use a lot

00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:14,570
we don't know but we can here this out

00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:16,610
and then you know one day maybe a few

00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:19,610
weeks later you know these oh well but

00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:21,680
like everything's can't station and

00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:23,750
maybe you start doing supporting right

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,700
maybe about your team

00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,890
our deadlines coming up maybe get there

00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,810
with a dial service attack right stuff

00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:32,350
happens you can't keep up I'll just do

00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:36,050
this oh this one for class that we find

00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:37,610
and manage might be fine right you just

00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:39,500
anymore to people we probably got to do

00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:41,720
some coding but once you get past that

00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,280
right like very cool again it's the

00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,080
situation where first it'll feel great

00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:49,120
right like you're shipping stuff it's

00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,120
getting done code and you can see that

00:13:53,140 --> 00:14:00,770
is by definition if you as a manager are

00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:03,200
doing the work itself you're not doing

00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:05,120
your job right your job is to give the

00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,490
support and structure that your team

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,520
needs to do their job well and their job

00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:11,920
is to get that work done accordingly if

00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,240
you're just doing the work yourself

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,760
eventually your team is going to not

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,930
have to take the support in the

00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,970
structure they need to get their job

00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:21,860
done and it's all gonna fall apart right

00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,450
ideally hopefully maybe just get lucky

00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:26,570
and you realize what you're going to get

00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:28,070
back off but so it's the end of the day

00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:29,480
blessing is mentioned it's not about

00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,070
doing the work it's about facilitating

00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,890
the work and making sure people have

00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:37,580
anything so we have past that we stop

00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:42,850
the coding you know it's it's so we

00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:42,850
gotta manage thanks for going great

00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:50,650
there's a certain point where you can

00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:53,660
just get comfortable and you can just

00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:55,070
okay like there's nothing for setting up

00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:58,040
higher so I'm going fine rights are you

00:14:55,070 --> 00:15:00,020
to chill and increasingly comes to the

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,370
opinion that while lazy engineers are a

00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:04,100
good thing because they're clever and

00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:06,260
efficient Lacey managers are not lazy

00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:09,500
managers are best adequate managers and

00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,760
usually our city managers so instead

00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,790
yeah we're seing our laurels you see

00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:17,600
like what's okay how can we think about

00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:19,400
go me a step up hug me a ball barking

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,410
into a way where we understand two

00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,510
things in a deeper way and power up to

00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,680
the next level right and for me the next

00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,940
level thing too

00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,220
understands that mansion is about

00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,740
relationships right of course you have

00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,180
to like figure out like they'll just mix

00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,740
this up in the eloquent our situations

00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,089
are coming up but really the thing

00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,370
that's gonna enable you to deal with

00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:39,200
those situations really well is to have

00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,220
a really solid relationships right and

00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,930
those are the relationships of course

00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:45,860
between your old you and your reports

00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:47,839
and you and your manager between your

00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,490
team and between the members of the

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,959
individuals on your team right you have

00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,029
to make sure do everything you can to

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,740
encourage and build votes so that when

00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:56,029
things do hit the fan those

00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:58,190
relationships will be there and they'll

00:15:56,029 --> 00:16:00,200
be something that you can count so how

00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:02,060
do we go about doing this right well

00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,490
certainly trust right I really should be

00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:06,830
for that trust isn't a relationship it's

00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:08,690
really pretty fundamental turn but

00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:14,480
that's easy to say that's the little me

00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:15,020
I actually do this not gonna be very

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:21,110
effective

00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:23,270
so how do we to start any a community

00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,860
right this if if you can't communicate

00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:29,839
it's gonna be really really hard to

00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:31,490
build trust right is again like try some

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,230
communication air pilots in studios

00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:36,320
right you can't have one without the

00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:38,990
other and just you need both lozania

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,000
have effective communications a bit of a

00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:44,750
specific thank corner communication that

00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,800
I my experiences manager is probably the

00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,600
biggest bang for the buck that you're

00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:51,170
going to get is having one-on-one all

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:54,140
right everybody all my American courts I

00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:56,330
have on the counter standing me for half

00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,950
an hour every week right maybe here and

00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:00,020
there we skip it but like it's pretty

00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,339
hard by a list of like meetings done I'm

00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,350
gonna drop there's a lot of meetings I'm

00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:05,839
going to drop the core elements and the

00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,949
reason for that is especially when you

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,920
get into a place where this is just a

00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:11,900
known thing a minimum it creates a very

00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,579
low friction environment to ask and have

00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,589
the Congress

00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:16,959
things that like are not pressing enough

00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:18,880
issues to light disrupt somebody's day

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,709
and like put it on meeting on the

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,360
calendar or something like that for but

00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:23,649
maybe is still burning up you know five

00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,149
percent cycles in the back somebody's

00:17:23,649 --> 00:17:27,029
brain right or worse making them nervous

00:17:25,149 --> 00:17:28,750
or that they didn't understand and

00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:30,909
understanding nothing do their job

00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,500
better going beyond that one wants to be

00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:34,240
really powerful in that once you get

00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:42,039
past the first few you're gonna have

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:43,659
this thing where you can kind of push

00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:45,070
past unless they're installed stuff and

00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:47,110
then from there continue have deeper

00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:49,570
conversations conversations maybe now

00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:51,850
about work maybe about sort of career

00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:53,889
stuff conversations about life right and

00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:56,350
then that's gonna do a lot to build that

00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:57,190
relationship build that trust so the

00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,480
else that you're going to need and we're

00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,470
going to talk more about this later is

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,649
empathy right

00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:03,820
if you can't understand the perspective

00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,690
that somebody is coming from when

00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,330
they're trying to communicate something

00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:08,590
to you nine times out of ten whatever

00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:10,299
they're saying it's gonna sound like

00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:13,750
crazy gibberish that you can't figure

00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:15,010
out right so while it's possible

00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,149
accompany communication without

00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,830
everything is gonna be really hard and

00:18:16,149 --> 00:18:18,909
really into that so it's gonna be

00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,320
running for there's lots other reasons

00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:23,169
we're running empathy will get that a

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,730
little bit in the last page building

00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:26,740
trusting relationships you need to make

00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:28,450
a plan right so it's one thing to have a

00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:31,000
conversation let's say you know we

00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,899
figure out you know make somebody else

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,149
we haven't where they are but they

00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:35,799
really really want to work on parking

00:18:34,149 --> 00:18:38,130
decks right because that's really what's

00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:42,370
gonna get my sign up with them engage

00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:45,070
there's a chance that just my projects

00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:47,080
just happen but realistically speaking

00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:49,090
Japanese a plan to make that happen and

00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,919
if you make the plan now you're

00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:52,990
combining the communication with the

00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:55,419
action the follow-up action and that can

00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:58,840
become a cycle duck then continues to to

00:18:55,419 --> 00:19:01,210
build trust and build confidence that if

00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,700
we have a conversation about let's say a

00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:04,549
problem

00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:07,700
our challenge and we conversation to

00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:09,200
come to a solution it makes you know

00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,539
more and more trust them you'll actually

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,740
get to the real solution right but

00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:18,230
requires action so planning you need it

00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:20,720
and so right so recap management's about

00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:22,159
relationships cool so you know power up

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,279
a little bit we're doing doing a little

00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:27,710
better well it's just like before things

00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:31,399
can't stay simple and easy and hard

00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:35,360
sometimes yeah you're gonna have the

00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:36,710
right day in particular what is almost

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,659
starting to happen on a low enough

00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,010
timeline and really a shorter one than

00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:41,720
you think

00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,730
somebody on your team is going to become

00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,580
disengaged right I was really lucky when

00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:48,049
I became a manager in that my is super

00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,220
easy to nitrogen right everybody was

00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:50,750
super engaged they really enjoyed that

00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,600
were thing both company to carry about

00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:55,279
what we were doing and they all got

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,480
along forever right it was obviously

00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:58,519
work to do but they were super easy

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:03,019
alright but eventually you know just

00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:04,250
life in humans and things happen and all

00:20:03,019 --> 00:20:06,580
soon you start noticing that you know

00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:09,409
some a routine who normally is like

00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:12,760
super super active in conversations and

00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:14,929
like really cares about their work and

00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,179
has a great attitude girl signs like

00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:19,029
maybe you know just doing the bare

00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:21,740
minimum to technically do their job

00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:24,139
maybe comes in and has a bad attitude a

00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:27,380
they're just either not really talking

00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:29,539
much or are maybe were seeing an active

00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,220
aggressive they just you know clearly

00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:33,460
something has changed and it's not for

00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,460
the better

00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:49,250
step through their code to see what's

00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:51,620
going wrong right and especially if

00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:54,049
you're relatively non-confrontational

00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,610
ahead you're in your first gut reaction

00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:57,950
is going to be just stick your head in

00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:59,090
the same right just say well you know

00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:01,159
maybe they'll just wear it out they'll

00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:03,470
be fine and for a few days that might be

00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:04,639
fine but going on that is a really

00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:07,480
really bad plan

00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:10,909
it's just it's not gonna work out and

00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:13,210
the reason for that is any almost any

00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:17,230
situation that is clogging somebody

00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:20,620
engage and have major changes in

00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:22,059
behavior beyond a few days by the nature

00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,649
almost certainly it are not going to

00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:25,090
resolve themselves all right sometimes

00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:26,289
as well and good luck out but most the

00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:29,049
time it's not going to get better and so

00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:30,669
let's work through some examples to see

00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:33,460
what me right so here's a real

00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:34,960
worst-case scenario let's say that the

00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:38,110
reason that somebody's become disengaged

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,110
and has had an emotional shift is that

00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:42,929
they are receiving some form of abuse or

00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:46,270
harassment from somebody in the company

00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:48,279
right if if you let's say some of your

00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:50,620
team is getting pricing messages in a

00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:52,740
DMX like every day right that's gonna

00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,610
blow away their motivation real quick

00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,200
and it's not gonna be something that's

00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:58,270
necessarily visible to you right like

00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,740
obviously if somebody is coming up with

00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:02,049
like smacking your developer on the back

00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,789
of the head like yeah no you have a

00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:05,110
conversation you deal with that but the

00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:08,289
reality of it is especially in the

00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:09,850
modern world where it's not you know

00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:12,429
considered part of like society to do

00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:15,460
this kind of stuff it happen

00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:18,100
Alton of wrestlers will take those

00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:20,409
actions in ways that are only invisible

00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:23,200
to the person who is doing the abuse and

00:22:20,409 --> 00:22:24,700
being abused right similarly when

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,049
somebody's doing it receiving their

00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:29,770
views especially big haven't dealt with

00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:31,690
this before they may not reach out yet

00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:33,340
right like they might be ashamed about

00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:35,590
it they might be embarrassed they might

00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:38,649
just not know who to reach out to yeah

00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:40,059
so if this is happening to somebody who

00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:42,640
noticed a change in them but you don't

00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:43,630
say hey what's up and they get a bit to

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,730
get to this point

00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:47,860
hey you might be leaving here employing

00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:51,450
a really terrible place which is a awful

00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:54,490
thing to do somebody be you're likely

00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:55,659
you're also then allowing the bad

00:22:54,490 --> 00:23:00,100
behavior on the other person's party

00:22:55,659 --> 00:23:01,809
continue and and all like this that

00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,789
person is going to Mestre quit in worst

00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:07,450
case they might sue you both you and

00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:08,830
your employer and just we're stating all

00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,419
those other things are way worse than

00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:14,020
the lawsuit thing but just in case

00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:14,860
that's still a thing right so if that's

00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,620
situation

00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,150
not gonna take care of itself it might

00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,710
be something going on that sorry right

00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:22,270
so another scenario might be let's say

00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:24,549
they're going through a health condition

00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:28,900
they their loved ones are going through

00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:29,830
a health condition maybe they're going

00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,170
through some kind of mental health

00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:34,090
crisis right all my stuff is stuff that

00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:36,160
can impact them at work and again is

00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:37,480
unlikely to resolve it so this one is a

00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,370
bit more complicated right because

00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,870
there's certainly a line to tow right

00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:43,090
like there's a lot of somebody's

00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:45,610
personal life that is not really your

00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:48,190
business that's their manager work but

00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:49,720
there's still a long that can be done in

00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:51,309
a lot of benefits beginning by having

00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,580
the conversation just by saying is

00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:55,960
somebody like hey I've noticed that like

00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,900
you don't seem to be super happy lately

00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,910
and to be honest your work gets me going

00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:02,740
isn't as good as it used to be what's up

00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:04,750
right just having that initial

00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,860
conversation can go really long way for

00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:08,320
somebody's going through something and

00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:09,660
that they may not even realize it right

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,309
when you're going through a really

00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:14,020
something like that where your personal

00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:16,299
life is disrupting your professional

00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:17,620
life a lot of times in the moment you

00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:21,730
don't necessarily realize what's

00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:23,049
happening or how your house repacking a

00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:25,240
little part of your life right so just

00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:26,679
just having that giving somebody that

00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,210
feedback to be really helpful and

00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:29,470
powerful to them because just like

00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:31,240
anything else like if they don't know

00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:34,240
that something's wrong they can't fix it

00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,950
right and then beyond that if they do

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,960
share with you that oh hey you know I am

00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,370
going through something then you can

00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,080
have a conversation about what support

00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:42,790
you can write maybe it's a situation

00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,440
wherever you can't there's not really

00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:46,510
anything you do but a minimum say hey if

00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,530
you ever want to talk right they can be

00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:50,559
there for them in that way

00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:51,760
but unlikeliness you can you know how

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,260
clean at least better understand what

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,309
their options are right like understand

00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,540
help them understand if they need to

00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:56,890
take some lead what does that look like

00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:59,140
in your company and what the options are

00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:01,360
there they are going through some kind

00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,860
of mental health issue you can help help

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,809
them get your resources and professional

00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,910
help that they may need to get what they

00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:07,720
need right but again if you ignore all

00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:09,669
this and you don't have that

00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,190
conversation like hey what's up it's not

00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:14,290
gonna get better

00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:15,880
going beyond that or they're kind of

00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:18,620
unpleasant errors let's say the

00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:21,780
legitimate board right like they're just

00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:23,670
it's not interesting anymore also

00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:26,850
unlikely to get better unless you have

00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:31,530
the conversation it's only gonna get

00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:34,410
worse so you know as I've kind of been

00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:36,330
hinting at the solution here is to to

00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:39,360
talk and don't let stuff slide for to go

00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:40,410
right it's not gonna get Jared Jared

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,730
speaking it's not gonna get better on

00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:46,230
its own and in addition to the the

00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:49,140
direct situation of the two you know

00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:50,970
your record or being impacted all this

00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,290
is how many other while all that's going

00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:54,450
on it's also having a impact on the

00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:56,490
larger team right um if you have the

00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:58,170
experience but if you if you're happy

00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:00,990
doing your job but the person sitting

00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:03,180
next to you is miserable every day that

00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:05,940
like that takes aware right it can

00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:07,200
become a toxic kind of thing and at the

00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,880
end of a you have to come to some kind

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,320
of resolution right like in that initial

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,030
conversation you're probably not gonna

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,580
like magically fix the world because

00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:15,720
that's not how life works but at some

00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,130
point we do move I should probably ought

00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,030
to get to a resolution of either you're

00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:20,130
on the path and it's an ongoing

00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:22,080
conversation and your your figure out

00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:23,160
that make things better or you're coming

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,690
to a place where you have a shared

00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,560
understanding like well maybe this isn't

00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:27,090
the place for you anymore

00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,160
right and that's never a fun

00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:31,440
conversation but it's way better than

00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,970
alternatives of having some anger team

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,500
be miserable and then very possible for

00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:42,120
the rest of your team so that's all so

00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:44,130
what's in here is issues nothing left so

00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,340
again please doing okay we got through

00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,170
that

00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,690
you know let's say we work through the

00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:51,090
issue it's okay and we're back to a

00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:53,880
place where maybe excited us on our

00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:55,050
laurels again alright okay we've made

00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,430
through that you feel like we

00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,290
accomplished something and maybe maybe

00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:00,030
we we help somebody for a hard time now

00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:01,920
they're better right they're actually

00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:03,450
also working I was like when you can

00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,750
help somebody for a hard time and they

00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:06,120
come

00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:09,690
acting that better as a really rewarding

00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,220
experiences imagine today were there but

00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:13,650
again right these managers of shitty

00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,750
managers so what can we do to step it up

00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:19,160
again right what's the next level up as

00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:21,000
a manager and the next big one for me is

00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,590
coming to an understanding of how

00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,890
fundamental self awareness and empathy

00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:27,480
are for being imagined right so what I

00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:33,080
mean here so self awareness is being

00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:36,090
able to understand hey I understand

00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,560
watching were feeling and at least have

00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:40,890
an idea of why you might be feeling that

00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:43,620
and how it presents others and empathy

00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:46,560
is the flip side of that right being

00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:47,820
able to - as fast as possible put

00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,380
yourself in somebody else's shoes and

00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,580
understand what they might be feeling in

00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:53,940
a given situation and why they might be

00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:56,190
killing and okay sure this is talk about

00:27:53,940 --> 00:28:00,960
soft fuzzy things with soft as he humans

00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:02,450
and these are some things like what am I

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,350
actually care like what is the actual

00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:07,020
practical applications and meanings of

00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:08,490
this in this role there's a few of them

00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,360
right so one of the first ones that we

00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,590
already talked about a bit is

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,980
communication right

00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:15,270
if you can't excite if you can't

00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,520
understand what's the waste coming from

00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:18,570
and what their perspective is especially

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,450
if you're getting into more and more

00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:23,010
serious and more and more stressful

00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:25,710
situations it's gonna be harder and

00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:27,660
harder to understand what they are

00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:28,920
actually trying to say right like you

00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,900
could hear the words they're saying you

00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:33,030
understand but but the you'll be missing

00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:36,030
the context of where they're coming from

00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:38,250
similarly if you're not aware of your

00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:40,470
own omission own emotional state and

00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,780
we're how you're protecting that you are

00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:45,060
likely going to be saying something and

00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:49,620
being heard in another way right so

00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:50,670
that's all significant the next one also

00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,230
kind of likes back to something I've

00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:53,690
talked about before right you remember I

00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:56,059
said that as

00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:58,820
as leader everything you do get simple

00:28:56,059 --> 00:29:00,559
amplified one of the big ways that this

00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,059
manifest is you set the tone for the

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,279
team right like you can't throw a

00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:05,750
mandate like hey we are happy today so

00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:07,899
it is happy right like that doesn't work

00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:09,860
by the other hand right and you can

00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:12,230
organize this from your own experience

00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,759
right if your manager comes in like

00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,049
there and get moved in they're excited

00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:16,460
right but that can touch this and grow

00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:19,070
it similarly if they come in and their

00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:21,919
emotional mess right like they come in

00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:24,769
losing their mind at best everybody's

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,840
like hey what's up with that guy and of

00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:28,220
course they're gonna feed off that and

00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:31,009
become emotional message themselves

00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:33,110
right so like that's all thing and

00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:34,820
really at the bottom level of it where

00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:38,059
it comes down to is your job is now

00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:40,129
people right and fundamental you know

00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:43,759
part just the basic human experience is

00:29:40,129 --> 00:29:45,019
emotion an emotion is a huge component

00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:46,490
of everything we do and how we

00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:48,080
experience the world so unless you can

00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:51,169
both understand and manage your own

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,639
emotions and see that in others you're

00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:54,049
gonna be in her place so how do you

00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:55,700
actually go about doing this right if

00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:58,340
it's so important what the actual

00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,990
mechanisms for this one of the most

00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,129
powerful concepts for me in

00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:05,620
understanding this is this idea of

00:30:01,129 --> 00:30:08,110
emotional intelligence it's basically a

00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:12,860
way of thinking about an understanding

00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:13,519
being able to set out from the moment of

00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,470
yourself

00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:18,590
recognize what's going on with yourself

00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:20,269
and then be able to then from there kind

00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:21,470
of work right it's actually it's

00:30:20,269 --> 00:30:23,029
basically problem-solving a pleasure

00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:25,429
emotions you are your own emotions right

00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:26,659
so okay what's going on here and then

00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:30,220
keep on pulling up right till you get to

00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:33,950
the root cause and just like you know

00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:35,539
applying problem solving when you can

00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:36,710
and gets that place like oh hey I'm

00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:39,500
angry what's that about

00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:40,820
oh this needs to start that thing is

00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,559
happening just have that level of

00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,570
understanding because there's a lot of

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,090
power to it in

00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:48,309
you're both Europe your actual emotional

00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:50,559
state and how you're presenting one per

00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:52,239
capita coming out here if you go

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,549
research emotional intelligence after

00:30:52,239 --> 00:30:57,009
this which I encourage you to do beware

00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:58,840
that is a very deep rabbit hole and as

00:30:57,009 --> 00:31:01,149
you get deeper down in it there's some

00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,720
stuff that sounds very science II but

00:31:01,149 --> 00:31:06,909
maybe it's less sciency than they think

00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:09,039
beware take an increasingly larger dose

00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:10,809
of salt as you dig deeper down a lot of

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:14,769
the top-level stuff is really quite

00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:18,629
useful another way we are learning my

00:31:14,769 --> 00:31:20,799
emotional problems that you can really

00:31:18,629 --> 00:31:22,539
develop sense of self-awareness and

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,999
again ongoing feedback has to talk to

00:31:22,539 --> 00:31:26,409
other people right so might mean talking

00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:27,820
to yours and if the other me we might

00:31:26,409 --> 00:31:30,429
need some friends right let people who

00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:31,690
are in your life if you are especially

00:31:30,429 --> 00:31:32,919
if you're in a state where you're

00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,479
different from how you normally are

00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:35,619
they're going to be the first people to

00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:37,149
notice and they're going to be the best

00:31:35,619 --> 00:31:38,440
people to be able to talk to you about

00:31:37,149 --> 00:31:40,779
it right just like you said before

00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,359
giving the feedback to your employees if

00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:46,119
they're in a bit of a weird place you're

00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:47,499
also like yours there's this recursive

00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:50,169
problem the management of you two are

00:31:47,499 --> 00:31:51,489
human accordingly you're not necessarily

00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:53,349
we kind of recognize when you're in a

00:31:51,489 --> 00:31:55,210
bad place right and getting feedback and

00:31:53,349 --> 00:31:56,229
spiky knows who's really helpful another

00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:58,059
for talking to people that's really

00:31:56,229 --> 00:31:59,470
helpful is talking to somebody who's

00:31:58,059 --> 00:32:00,669
completely uninvolved from anything in

00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:02,950
your life right this might be a life

00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:06,309
coach this might be a counselor of some

00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:08,049
kind it might be a therapist but having

00:32:06,309 --> 00:32:09,549
an outside perspective especially if

00:32:08,049 --> 00:32:10,779
that person who's providing outside

00:32:09,549 --> 00:32:12,759
perspective has training and

00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:15,849
understanding now like human brains and

00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:18,279
minds work is really helpful I strongly

00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:20,409
encourage you to find some semantics for

00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:21,549
that something else that's been really

00:32:20,409 --> 00:32:23,649
helpful for me is meditation

00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:25,239
I know this can sound when your crunchy

00:32:23,649 --> 00:32:27,129
if you're not familiar with it I assure

00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:27,550
you like there is an extreme end up like

00:32:27,129 --> 00:32:29,740
you

00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:31,480
practicing maybe your you know that

00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,500
actually is a thing in this there and I

00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,330
encourage you to despoil if that's

00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,560
interesting to you there's also lots of

00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:39,000
formative annotation where it's

00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:41,380
literally just sitting someplace in and

00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,580
feeding with yourself and going through

00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,260
this process of understanding what's

00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:45,550
going on or even just going for a walk

00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:47,590
and maybe not listen to the headphones

00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:48,850
right like that actually gets really

00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:51,010
close to someone but early forms of

00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:52,570
meditation and it can be a really

00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:54,240
powerful tool to help you understand

00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:56,920
what's going on with your self mastery

00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,990
so I can't really bit outside on the

00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,130
empathy side right so what is anything

00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:01,450
right we talked about a little bit so

00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:02,920
one form is saying imagine the

00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:04,630
projection of one's film consciousness

00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,760
on another fight more common colloquial

00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:09,220
way of saying is putting yourself in

00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,380
somebody else's shoes but ultimately

00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:13,990
there's a challenge in this right in

00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,670
that again one of the kind of

00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:17,290
fundamental aspects of being human is

00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:19,270
that we are the single mind stuck in the

00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:21,370
single meat body and we don't actually

00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:24,220
have the ability to project ourselves

00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:26,410
anywhere outside that one experience

00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:28,390
right we can never truly understand the

00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:30,820
experience from somebody else else's

00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:33,040
perspective well fortunately it's a

00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:35,500
spectrum and not a binary right so what

00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:37,330
is the spectrum you just have no able

00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,430
slice experiences just or you might not

00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:42,580
even be aware that there's experience

00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:44,050
that somebody has had right at the

00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,640
Irvine Spectrum would be like this blue

00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:47,080
tonic ideal actually be able to

00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,580
experience the world through somebody

00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,920
else's eyes which is on attainable

00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:54,010
thankfully there's a whole lot of space

00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:55,420
in between there right and there's a

00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:58,330
bunch of stuff that will kind of get

00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:59,710
into the next section ways you can

00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:01,570
actually learn about the experiences

00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:03,100
that other people have that lets you

00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:06,070
move closer to that I've learned in the

00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,260
spectrum and just released mushrooms so

00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:09,700
there's potential person right so

00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:11,710
there's the fact there's natural liberal

00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:17,470
practice of empathy having the thought

00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:18,669
and the habit of saying hold on let me

00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,960
think about this from their perspective

00:34:18,669 --> 00:34:23,440
right that's the first step that's

00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:26,230
required but kind of a very different

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,350
dimension is still the same thing when

00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:30,940
Andrews saying the key no mistake

00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:32,620
right like that's making it happen it

00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:34,810
was a hard like that's like that's

00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:36,790
another thing it's easy the hard problem

00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:38,710
is actually then when you do that coming

00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:40,090
from the understanding some ways much as

00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,650
possible and having enough background of

00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:44,340
the difference variance they can have to

00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:47,440
be that way so okay let's a little bit

00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:51,040
so management will cost software in

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,720
empathy there is an abstracted

00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,270
management that's really important it

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,130
has some serious overlap with this and

00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:58,300
what that comes and what that has to do

00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:00,870
with is the fact that people are

00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:04,570
different right Sarah he was in the back

00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:05,920
and all I forget Renee that the woman

00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:07,240
who spoke this morning right they

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,710
touched on this a lot right but people

00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,570
are very different and have had very

00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:12,100
different experiences accordingly

00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:14,920
everything that they come into they have

00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:18,610
their own perspective and context

00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:19,600
they're coming from and this has your

00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:21,550
empathy but there's also has

00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,260
implications for inclusiveness right

00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:25,030
what is it comfortable and ok for you

00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:27,460
may not be comfortable in ok for

00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:31,780
somebody else seeing if you're how to

00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:36,250
make that work right so you know what I

00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:38,680
mean I'm versus right so yeah classic

00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:40,600
white comfortable approach new story

00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:43,150
right like it wasn't until I was in my

00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:45,040
20s that I understood the level of

00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:47,620
harassment and entire

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,880
categories of people smile I just wasn't

00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:53,320
even aware that that was a thing right

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:55,570
so that's just a minor piece of the

00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:58,330
levels of how much you can not

00:35:55,570 --> 00:36:01,270
understand other people and on the flip

00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:03,520
side once you understand that situation

00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:05,950
how people becoming how do you become a

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,630
lot clearer in what ways you may be

00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:09,160
making something less inclusive economy

00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:12,280
right

00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,720
you know maybe let's say right so their

00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,520
cost example this is panic having

00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:19,060
requiring real names on social networks

00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,770
right for me as somebody who is who's

00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:24,880
never received a meaningful grassman -

00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:28,240
who is lives within cultural norms and

00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:32,730
who fits into a lot of cultural

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,849
stereotypes and language having a

00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:36,430
partner

00:36:33,849 --> 00:36:37,719
relay and affix gender and a social

00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:39,160
media profile pic that's fine whatever

00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:40,930
I'll just plug in at school

00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,099
we're all other people that's a much

00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:45,699
more complicated much more problematic

00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:46,509
exercise right and so how are we doing

00:36:45,699 --> 00:36:47,799
on this stuff

00:36:46,509 --> 00:36:49,359
getting into all the different forms so

00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:50,709
this is where young sort of this talk

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:52,150
there's people who can speak to it much

00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:54,579
better than I I'm gonna punch out a

00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:56,469
bunch of resources one of them is got

00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:59,339
deep feminism wiki as the name implies

00:36:56,469 --> 00:37:03,069
it has a lot of stuff specific to one

00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:04,449
aspect or one dimension of how people

00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:06,069
can be different that being said they

00:37:04,449 --> 00:37:08,229
also provide a lot of good they have a

00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:09,249
lot of great material on how I really

00:37:08,229 --> 00:37:11,529
think about inclusive being

00:37:09,249 --> 00:37:12,880
dimensionality hint if you're hearing

00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:17,799
the word dimensionality you don't know

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,880
what I mean you need to go read another

00:37:17,799 --> 00:37:19,869
thing I recommend is there's a

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,279
conference that happens every year in

00:37:19,869 --> 00:37:22,539
Portland called open source bridge it's

00:37:21,279 --> 00:37:25,239
a tech conference but it has a fantastic

00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:26,499
people track this year's actually just

00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:29,380
happened I think about two weeks ago was

00:37:26,499 --> 00:37:30,789
right after a Python in Portland and

00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:35,769
they have a lot of really good talks on

00:37:30,789 --> 00:37:37,299
both generally inclusivity and how

00:37:35,769 --> 00:37:39,519
different people will interact with the

00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:42,430
world but also have that intersects with

00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:44,910
technology they have videos from all the

00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:47,859
prior years that's gonna check it out

00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:50,019
this great program called fun Club run

00:37:47,859 --> 00:37:52,299
by an after I didn't and chair McCain a

00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:53,349
if you want to throw money at people

00:37:52,299 --> 00:37:55,209
trying to make this better for people

00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:57,729
who maybe don't fit into the mold so

00:37:55,209 --> 00:37:59,380
well this is a great way to do so

00:37:57,729 --> 00:38:01,269
beyond that the organizations that they

00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,709
work with all practice fantastic

00:38:01,269 --> 00:38:04,959
resources to learn about the experiences

00:38:02,709 --> 00:38:08,079
of others I know it's pretty to check it

00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:10,209
out one must fall away and come with a

00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,319
lust way so I'll touch on here to learn

00:38:10,209 --> 00:38:15,219
about the experiences other its

00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:17,289
immediate right obviously talking to

00:38:15,219 --> 00:38:19,900
people and hearing like for mallesh

00:38:17,289 --> 00:38:23,949
market possible man I messed up but

00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:27,279
media books movies TV podcasts like all

00:38:23,949 --> 00:38:29,529
that storytelling as a larger mechanism

00:38:27,279 --> 00:38:31,239
right is a very powerful in an emotional

00:38:29,529 --> 00:38:33,099
way up to the Skinner perspective on

00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:34,599
somebody else's experience and there's a

00:38:33,099 --> 00:38:35,490
whole spectrum medium that that

00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:38,310
especially once you

00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:39,390
look at things through this lens right

00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:41,700
this there's all kinds we gave that

00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:43,230
obviously directly tries to convey a

00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,850
particular experience there's lots of

00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:46,200
other media where it happens either by

00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:49,530
accent or is it done in a much more

00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:51,920
subtle or something and I couldn't

00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:54,510
really actually multiplier on this is

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,060
looking for a really good analysis of

00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:58,890
media right because this helps you aside

00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,690
from actually pulling things out and

00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:04,860
helping you learn about additional

00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:06,540
concepts it also helps you learn to

00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,650
recognize wait something's going on the

00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,390
media where somebody's many different

00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,590
spirits from you and how the and what

00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,970
better ways to think about and learn

00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,860
about that others are pretty good

00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:16,110
example but that I love so there's this

00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:17,720
YouTube terrible buggy buggy idea

00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:21,870
channel it's from PBS Digital Studios

00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:24,390
this particular video is talks about the

00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:26,130
character beam on a better path if you

00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:28,260
just seen a bunch of time you play it's

00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:30,510
a super weird kids cartoon you're kind

00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,970
of right there's also some really deep

00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:34,830
amazing stuff in that and this gets into

00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:37,110
some of the details about and these are

00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:40,620
all just exams right like the world

00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:42,210
immediacy is here so learn about and be

00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:44,880
inclusive it's a big deal that's

00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:47,790
important right so this is where things

00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,290
get yeah how about uses understanding

00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:51,390
all this is right for empathy but it's

00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:52,740
also really important that your team is

00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,150
a place that is welcoming and

00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:56,640
comfortable for everybody right

00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:59,760
otherwise hey you're just being a kind

00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,810
of shaking and being but be you're just

00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,220
gonna lose out with lots of

00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:04,980
opportunities to learn and get better

00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:07,230
people working on your team so that's

00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:09,440
important and one last thing that has

00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:11,400
another mention of it is as a manager

00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,680
you're on the frontline of mental health

00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:19,050
right whether you want to deal with this

00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:21,030
or not if subbing in your team is going

00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:23,400
through some kind mental health issue

00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:25,440
you were probably one of a small handful

00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,150
of people in their life or in a position

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,540
to recognize them that's happening

00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:31,620
and to be in a place to offer support

00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:33,210
there's a really big stigma around

00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,440
mental health in this country so it's

00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:36,060
getting better but it's still super

00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,010
weird there's a guy I think where it

00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,840
gets a lot of great talks on this I'm

00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:41,520
gonna say a lot of time so if somebody

00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,260
wears glasses might lose their bosses

00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,060
you don't tell them to squint harder

00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:48,390
right but that's crazy and just kind of

00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:49,440
a dick move right don't do that well

00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:51,390
telling somebody who's going through

00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,180
clinical depression to just smile and

00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:56,220
cheer up is equally as insane even on a

00:40:54,180 --> 00:41:00,330
physiological level it's just not how

00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:02,460
that works right so stem only to all the

00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:03,810
other stuff I can't pull the mental

00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,480
health stuff in the table I can punch I

00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:08,490
had a lot of really good resources open

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,020
sourcing mental illness there's run by a

00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:11,820
team player they have a lot of great

00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,410
talks on the intersection of mental

00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,480
health and tech there's actually I don't

00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:17,550
remember the numbers off my head but

00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,780
there's a bunch of sherry studies gonna

00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:20,940
show there's actually a significantly

00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:22,410
higher occurrence of mental health

00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,030
issues within the tech industry compared

00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:25,950
to a lot of other industries so it's

00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:27,780
something to be aware of and there are

00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:30,330
aspects of our industry that make this

00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:31,980
worse most of mine does a lot of good

00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:35,100
job of sharing information about that

00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:36,990
prompt is another great project kind of

00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:40,980
doing education elemental health and

00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:42,660
tech and I lost kind of major piece here

00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,700
that I recommend that you do if you're

00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,900
if there if you are manager or you would

00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,970
think about becoming a manager I

00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:50,220
strongly recommend that you go on and do

00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:51,270
mental health first aid training so the

00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:54,450
idea of mental health first aid training

00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:56,430
starting in Australia they run 2007 and

00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:59,070
the idea is so with medical first aid

00:41:56,430 --> 00:42:01,380
that is that we can't train everybody be

00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:04,290
doctors for all kinds of mostly obvious

00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:06,720
reasons but what we can do is give

00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:09,180
everybody a small amount of training so

00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,770
that enables them to stabilize somebody

00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:13,230
long enough that they can get

00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:14,760
professional mental health mental health

00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,560
first aid basic taste idea and applies

00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,420
them to the mental health right it gives

00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,160
you it's not going to put you in a place

00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,450
where you can diagnose with what's going

00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,400
on with somebody it's not going to get

00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:25,320
you in a place where you can fix what's

00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,290
going on somebody but it will give you

00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,390
the resources so it's a day-long force

00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:30,920
it's usually provided by your local

00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:34,310
Department in the US and it's usually

00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:36,740
free in front of this course you will

00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:37,730
learn how to recognize when somebody

00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:40,490
might be going through a mental health

00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:43,880
episode what are what are some that come

00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:46,940
in forms of that intake and from their

00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,560
understanding how the best deescalate

00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:50,510
the situation help somebody get

00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,980
stabilized and then point and then have

00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:54,410
resources to point them to to get the

00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:56,390
help they need just like you should not

00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:57,650
be doing surgery on people you should

00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,910
not actually be helping people with

00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:01,370
mental health issues you should be

00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,390
getting them to professionals but still

00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,160
learning about this is really helpful

00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:06,440
and again just like the inclusivity

00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,060
stuff it's really important both for be

00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,010
able to support your team well and to be

00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:12,800
hungry to be able to better understand

00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:14,420
what somebody might become so with that

00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,100
we're more or less done right so we're

00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:17,900
first time into management and we're

00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:20,570
doing okay we're trying to fill out the

00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:30,560
world try to figure out a way to pencil

00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:32,540
myself as long as we keep in mind that

00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,580
becoming a manager is a choice as well

00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:37,910
that's that permanent right you can come

00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:40,750
back that mansion is vulnerable skill

00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:44,050
and somewhere it's an empathy are

00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:44,050
