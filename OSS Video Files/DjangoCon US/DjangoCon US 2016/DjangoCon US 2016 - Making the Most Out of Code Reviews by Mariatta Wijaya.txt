	Making the Most Out of Code Reviews by Mariatta Wijaya

Code review is like a buzzword in the programming world. Developers often talk about how important it is. But what really happens during code review? What do you achieve out of it? How can we learn during code review? This talk will present ideas of what should be the goals of a code review, and how can developers learn during code review process.

This talk was presented at: https://2016.djangocon.us/schedule/presentation/39/

	00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:22,550
this is my first time in just a minute

00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:30,449
yeah just a bit more about me I guess I

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:34,200
work in Vancouver Canada engineering

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:54,680
show me pictures and ladies learning

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:54,680
code it's about

00:02:31,740 --> 00:03:26,410
I made them also members who didn't

00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:30,180
prioritize to the audience on their own

00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,180
told finish in their own tasks

00:03:32,280 --> 00:04:04,590
I start asking is worth doing we know

00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:14,100
it's practice but it's also sort of your

00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:17,730
daily stress on developers they know how

00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:21,180
to write good code shouldn't they be

00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:26,960
writing the best code all the time so we

00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:32,400
don't miss maybe before we can answer

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:37,070
whether I think very important you know

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,070
why why we even do it in the first place

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:50,630
is not just about readability not just

00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:50,630
about following standards conventions

00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:57,479
it's also not the place to evaluate

00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:00,530
someone skill it's not the case to

00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:05,220
determine who's trip to a programmer or

00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:09,270
who's not as good programmer you might

00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:13,280
try it assumption that senior developers

00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:17,990
do not meet that hope to be reviewed

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,950
always routinize the newcomers count

00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:24,710
that's not the point

00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,710
think of how negative it can be to be a

00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:45,380
they're real because we can I know some

00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,160
of us will start thinking about how

00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:52,790
ecstatic

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:57,640
eight once way there's more things that

00:05:52,790 --> 00:06:00,640
we to mean quality then just under

00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,640
inventions

00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:13,040
tastes like magic numbers the carrot

00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:30,620
code overly complicated functions there

00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:33,340
are so many things to look up care about

00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,340
performance

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:47,389
while security considerations so many

00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:53,870
things that we determine the quality of

00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:59,900
the code we stated on 8th or coding

00:06:53,870 --> 00:07:21,229
standards that we don't want to

00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:23,960
introduce we want to make sure it's

00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:29,240
native we know the goals of the d-link

00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:30,770
code you see something that should be

00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:37,310
fixed this is something that could be

00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:42,529
improved so speak up that's a better way

00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:58,430
to do things and help them help them be

00:07:42,529 --> 00:08:00,919
better incoming ok so just start by

00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:06,050
providing code samples showed them how

00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:08,089
to refactor the code maybe and you may

00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:10,009
want to offer her how to do pair

00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:12,080
programming with them if it's quite

00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:16,219
complicated maybe there are new at this

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:19,400
and they didn't really know much provide

00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:21,620
learning resources maybe you went to

00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:25,520
PyCon we went to ganga khan you'll learn

00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:29,389
about a lot of new things and your

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:32,149
coworker didn't share the knowledge so

00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:37,339
that I could learn and there makes code

00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:40,789
could be better part of doing code

00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:45,110
review is for the purpose of learning

00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:48,829
and knowledge transfer I think some of

00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:49,730
us might have missed disco I I know I

00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:53,360
did

00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:56,630
I thought that in the beginning I'm not

00:08:53,360 --> 00:09:01,699
qualified to do code reviews I didn't

00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:04,240
know how to comment but the reality is

00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:07,519
by participating in reveals

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:12,380
participating in discussion asking

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:15,410
questions reading lots of new code I get

00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:20,500
to learn so much I really become a

00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:24,260
better programmer through code review

00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:27,730
there's ever any confusion code review

00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:30,230
is the time to ask questions when

00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,970
programmer just finished writing it they

00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,519
know how to answer your question

00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:38,230
don't wait six months to ask what is

00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:40,970
this code about this is known as

00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,860
increasing your bass pattern you always

00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:45,920
want to make sure that there are other

00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:54,170
people in the team that knows about your

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:57,190
code so really code review is important

00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:59,620
it's essential you care about quality

00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:03,290
care about knowledge transfer

00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:07,310
you wanna wanna your team member to to

00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:09,649
be more experienced definitely have code

00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:15,050
review process because learning is so

00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:17,930
valuable I just wish that we don't be

00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:21,350
fixated on the term review it's really

00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:23,420
not just about scrutinizing commenting

00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:25,630
pointing out mistakes it's really more

00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,630
than that

00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:31,190
think of this process more like a

00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:39,490
conversation among friends among

00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:42,649
colleagues not about judging so you know

00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:44,240
we live this we know we need to have

00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:48,430
this kind of conversation we want to

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:51,350
learn we also know it could be negative

00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:56,269
how do we make this positive how do we

00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:59,209
keep I don't make this great again start

00:10:56,269 --> 00:11:00,890
with having some empathy I know that

00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:03,050
some of us may be okay

00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:05,060
being taught

00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:09,110
something wrong you need to fix things

00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:12,370
but not everyone can handle being

00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:16,580
scrutinized all the time every day

00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:18,350
having empathetic comments will those

00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:23,660
comments will be well received by

00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:27,050
everyone before jumping to read reviews

00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:29,450
read codes at the very least try to

00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:32,779
understand the context what is this code

00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:37,790
doing read the title at least to avoid

00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:40,459
any misunderstanding a programmer will

00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:42,769
try make the effort to create smaller

00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:47,750
much requests make it easier for people

00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:50,990
to review your code and often times when

00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:54,350
when we review we are really quick to

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:56,870
point out mistakes to criticize but when

00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:59,959
the code was good to begin with nothing

00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:03,829
needs fixing you even learned a thing or

00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:07,670
two often we say verily no you say

00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:12,560
nothing you say what's one you get the

00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:13,370
fairness say thank you don't take this

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,370
for granted

00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:19,010
I know it's it's the program of job to

00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:26,480
write code but you could still show

00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:29,209
appreciation a lot of projects probably

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,190
have a contribution guideline and then

00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:34,310
you should also have a code review

00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:38,779
guideline letting people know what's

00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:43,970
expected out of this process so what

00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:46,699
what should go into the guideline again

00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:52,699
coding standard you should have that

00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:56,329
it's not enough as a guideline start our

00:12:52,699 --> 00:12:58,520
code of conduct we we are bound to

00:12:56,329 --> 00:12:59,240
excellent code of conduct here at the

00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,149
conference

00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,500
it shouldn't stop when you come back to

00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:06,769
your company to your private

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:11,900
organization you should impose that in

00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:13,810
your own company think about

00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:18,590
what you do when there's conflict among

00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:23,510
developers each team might handle this

00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:26,090
differently specify a time line you may

00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:28,610
want to impose that the review gets done

00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:33,140
within a day or two but no longer than

00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:36,380
that it's a good idea to have a list of

00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:39,080
backup or alternate reviewers like don't

00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:42,500
limit reviewers to be just the same

00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:46,100
people all the time include outsiders

00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:51,740
they could offer you extra additional

00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:53,300
perspective so I think we know a bit

00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:56,890
more about this whole process of

00:13:53,300 --> 00:14:02,330
reviewing let's do a bit of practice

00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:07,270
this is an actual code that I found our

00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:07,270
legacy code and I'm maintaining it but

00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:18,230
simple lines it's a last thought system

00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:22,100
Ram Dass are some file name by the way

00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:24,050
we notice it's not it's not a following

00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:28,130
standard perhaps there's a better way to

00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:32,930
format strings right this is the old way

00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:39,620
we should use format should I change it

00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:44,620
so now Eileen is happy but I still don't

00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:48,260
understand what this do I did some I

00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:51,580
have some questions what is always

00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:55,730
thought system it's a way to invoke

00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:58,520
command line script from Python so while

00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:00,380
searching I also found out that I'm

00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:05,300
supposed to be using a different library

00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:11,540
this is not desired great I learned I

00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:14,930
love new things so I change it so I now

00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:19,250
we know what it's doing is executing RM

00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:22,300
dos - RF we're trying to delete the file

00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:27,190
and if there's any problem with it

00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:28,860
kara I don't know I'm not I'm not

00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:31,960
comfortable with this

00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:35,950
what if somebody forgot to pass on the

00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:42,130
filing there should be a better way to

00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:46,150
delete files from Python you could do Oh

00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:49,530
s dot remove same some package why why

00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:52,690
we start to executing command line split

00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:58,920
there is problem I want to know I wanted

00:15:52,690 --> 00:16:02,680
to do a try-catch exception from this so

00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:08,470
I'm much more comfortable with this than

00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:11,070
the previous code so let's ship it ship

00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:11,070
is now

00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:24,590
I think we have time for one or two

00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,900
questions if anyone wants to step up and

00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:29,450
ask the question hi thanks for doing the

00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,740
talk I have a question do you when

00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,030
you're doing code reviews do you work

00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,190
from like a style guide it means you

00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:36,590
just use like site Pepe its standards or

00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:38,300
do you develop internal style guides for

00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,560
coding because that's something like my

00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,420
organization is definitely grappling

00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,210
with right now yeah it's really

00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:47,510
different we try to use PAP 8 like I've

00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:51,410
used pylons and I also like use the time

00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:53,210
that comes with pycharm but every team

00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:56,390
members have their own preference like I

00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:58,760
have team that papers to use underscore

00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:02,420
and I dream that people to use like

00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,770
camel casing so everyone has their own

00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:09,709
preference it's something to be

00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:11,990
discussed with your own team I was

00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:13,790
really more curious to do like do you

00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,930
try to come up with a style guide in

00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,569
early when you have that conversation

00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:19,250
with your teams mm-hmm is there like do

00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:23,240
coding style guides work I guess is kind

00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:25,870
of it works if people are made aware of

00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:28,640
it like we've work in a really large

00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:31,520
organization sometimes knowledge got

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,250
lost like we have something written

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,800
about this and if people are not aware

00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:39,440
of it they don't read it and we ended up

00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,900
having to collect people too during

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:54,260
reviews telling them hey look we have

00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:56,150
good guideline I have tried to offload

00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:58,850
some of the code review work that I need

00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:01,460
to do for my team to kind of the entire

00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:07,100
team by kind of requiring them to get

00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:11,660
approvals on their merch requests but I

00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:13,820
find that a lot of times I'm not accede

00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:16,400
to ask like exactly sure what it is but

00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:18,230
the developers on my team don't often

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,080
provide a lot of feedbacks which I just

00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:22,820
see a lot of yep approve approve

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,280
sometimes find some things but do you

00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:26,900
have any tips for like kind of I mean

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,830
this coat conversation idea I think

00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:32,360
you know help but just tips for like

00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:35,870
encouraging developers to give each

00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:38,210
other constructive feedback and kind of

00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:39,290
establishing that culture of look just

00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,700
because you're giving someone feedback

00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:42,740
you're not attacking them like this is

00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:46,070
this is an opportunity yeah just kind of

00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:49,850
tips on I think I for myself

00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:51,620
it starts from me like I I know in the

00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:53,750
beginning that's all I do I say okay a

00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,700
proof plus one right but throughout time

00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:58,190
I realized that those feedback are

00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:01,910
important so when I do review I lose an

00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:04,460
extra time trying to help like Kat is I

00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:07,010
know this work is there a better ways

00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:09,440
let's do a bit of more research and but

00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:11,780
the thing is not every team might have

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,830
that luxury of extra time so it's it's

00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:18,170
something to be considered you know we

00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:20,420
have a tip on getting people there's

00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:22,130
even like have time in their day where

00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,420
they do it because a lot of times they

00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,530
just want to work on their own staff I

00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,750
don't want to spend time reviewing other

00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:29,060
people's stuff yeah I imposed this for

00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,800
myself like do it at least three times a

00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:33,290
day first thing in the morning before

00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,660
lunch or after lunch before I leave just

00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:38,990
make sure something kept calm but and

00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:40,940
really like realize that you need their

00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:43,430
help they will also need your help right

00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:45,980
and when you set good examples people

00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:52,220
start realizing that this is how it

00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:54,250
should be we have one more quick

00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,250
question

00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:05,160
I was wondering if you had any thoughts

00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:07,770
on how to scale this way way down to a

00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:10,560
very small team like say three

00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:13,590
developers yeah when you have three

00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:16,850
developers and you're you're gonna be

00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:19,170
pushing a lot of code all the time and

00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:21,600
yeah I don't know we struggle with this

00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:24,360
too I also have a small team and it's

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,720
just the same people again and again

00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:29,880
really try to get external reviewers if

00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,890
you can like different team within the

00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:35,940
same company or something like that just

00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:38,820
so just so they are not overloaded and

00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,470
if anybody they've been assigned too

00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,680
many reviews they should feel free to

00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:45,570
say I'm sorry I cannot do the review

00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:54,170
today maybe you want to ask somebody

00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:54,170
