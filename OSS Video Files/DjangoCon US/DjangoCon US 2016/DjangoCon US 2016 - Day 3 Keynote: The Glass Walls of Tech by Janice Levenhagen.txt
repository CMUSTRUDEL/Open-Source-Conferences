00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,020
that here at gencon we are all about

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,579
inclusivity this is not the first

conference about that she holds a BS in

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,399
computer engineering and an MBA and her

00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:49,800
passion lies in creating change to

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,379
improve women's lives to that end she

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,660
founded chick tech in 2012 based on her

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,460
experiences as a woman in technology and

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,289
is driven to provide a more positive

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:02,449
experience in the technology industry

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,449
for others so please help me welcome

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:17,229
everyone hear me okay good thanks

00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:20,290
everyone it's great to meet you all and

00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:24,310
good morning before we get started I

00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:26,530
would like to have each of you for two

00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:29,619
minutes introduce yourself to someone

00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:32,909
you haven't talked to yet and tell them

00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:37,020
how you got into technology specifically

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:40,240
who was most influential in your life

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,280
I'd love to hear who has an interesting

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,700
story about how they got into tech that

00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:49,569
they just told somebody else somebody's

00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,890
got him I know I know you do I would say

00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:55,240
when is about nine years old a friend of

00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:57,009
my mom's gave me a Apple a Mac 512 I get

00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,330
enough owes apple imac back then they

00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:59,890
had a scuzzy ribbon sticking out of the

00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,869
back of it hooked up to a 40 megabyte

00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:07,349
hard drive and I started playing with it

00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:09,399
and I here we are today nice who else I

00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:10,989
flunked out of college the first time

00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:12,579
because I had to take a math course it

00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:15,660
was a programming course and I didn't

00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:15,660
want to do political science anymore

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:22,870
awesome okay one more those ti

00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:30,540
calculators you can program games on

00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:30,540
those nice yes you can that is very true

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,160
so my talk today is about the glass

00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:38,769
walls of technology and why we haven't

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,959
been making as much progress bringing

00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:44,170
more people especially diverse people

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:48,569
into technology so when I say the glass

00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:48,569
walls of technology what do you think of

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,620
the glass ceiling right what else what

00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:56,170
do you think is building those walls

00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:59,310
what is what different kinds of things

00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,310
are keeping people out

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:13,550
yeah status quo time money education yep

00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:17,660
stereotypes sexism what was the yeah not

00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:20,300
so healthy culture yeah so basically the

00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,010
glass walls are a lot like the glass

00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,360
ceiling they're keeping certain people

00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:30,739
out there allowing certain people in

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:32,840
it's not that great for anybody and it's

00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:34,700
not that great for the industry and the

00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,160
interesting thing about both is that if

00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:39,799
you're not one of the groups that's

00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:44,450
being kept out it's very hard to see as

00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:46,519
well so today what I'm going to be

00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,769
talking to you about is first I'm going

00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:51,080
to talk about my organization chick tech

00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:53,150
I'm going to tell you the chick tech

00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,180
origin story I'm going to talk about my

00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:59,440
life and how different things in my life

00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,269
made me decide to start chick tech and

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,700
some interesting things that I got out

00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:06,739
of that I'm also going to be talking

00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,930
about the top three issues that I think

00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:12,410
are holding us back from making more

00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:14,120
progress on the diversity issue I have

00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,380
three different activities i'm hoping

00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,539
we'll be able to get to all three of

00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,669
them today because they somewhat build

00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:21,739
on each other and then if we have some

00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:27,620
time afterwards we'll have we'll be able

00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:29,690
to do some Q&A so chick tech is my

00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:33,820
favorite subject and not just because

00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:36,680
i'm the world's foremost expert on it

00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,110
luckily for you there's a time limit to

00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,840
this talk so i'll only be giving you a

00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:44,440
very quick rundown like I said there'll

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,850
be time at the QA if you have more

00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,190
in-depth questions I'm happy to answer

00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:51,110
them again i dunno literally everything

00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,760
about chick tech if there's not

00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,080
something i don't know i actually make

00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,780
it up and then make it true

00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,759
that is still true I'm also planning on

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,319
being around afterwards so that you can

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,970
connect with me I believe we have a

00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:05,159
half-hour break after that after the

00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:08,659
keynote and I'm happy to have more more

00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:12,000
discussions so chick tech is a 501 C 3

00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:14,069
we're a national nonprofit our mission

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,169
put simply is to get and keep girls and

00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:19,020
women in high tech we've been operating

00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:22,110
for about four and a half years we are

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:24,090
in 13 cities actually including Toronto

00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,590
I keep saying national but someday once

00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,120
we get all the paperwork in order I'll

00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,520
be able to officially say international

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:36,750
we have thousands of volunteers across

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:39,000
the country we have two sides to our

00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,680
mission as as you heard we have the

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,810
pipeline side where we're trying to get

00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,580
more girls and women into technology and

00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,500
we have the retention side where we're

00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:50,069
trying to keep the women who are in

00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,379
technology in technology on the pipeline

00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:55,349
side we've been really focusing so far

00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:57,719
on the K through 12 aspect we've been

00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:59,940
branching out into elementary and middle

00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:02,159
school camps in this summer but our

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,810
signature program is our year-long high

00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:06,210
school program we bring in a hundred

00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,800
high school girls specifically focusing

00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:10,020
on girls who aren't yet engaged in

00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,879
technology but who have the aptitude to

00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,529
do well and get them excited about

00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:17,219
technology and thinking about themselves

00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:20,069
as technical we do monthly workshops for

00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:22,889
these girls our goal with the workshops

00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:25,620
is to expand their idea of what a

00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:28,229
technology career looks like so rather

00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:31,889
than just do coding or rather than just

00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:34,129
do robotics we do those plus drones plus

00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:38,729
Internet of Things plus green energy

00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:41,430
plus filmmaking they get really creative

00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:45,389
on what they want to do in each chapter

00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:47,279
which is really exciting we also do a

00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:50,250
one-on-one mentoring program for our

00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:54,270
participants where we pair up our girls

00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:57,240
with men and women in the industry who

00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:59,370
can help them to look at their different

00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,039
options and understand where they might

00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:04,440
be able to fit into tech on the

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:06,959
retention side we run events through

00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,700
meetup in a little over half of our

00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,160
cities and we

00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,630
run a conference called act w which

00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,050
stands for advancing the careers of

00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:18,840
technical women our goal with all of our

00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:22,110
events and programs is not just to

00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,960
educate but to create community provide

00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:27,570
a sense of belonging and create

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,020
opportunities for women and girls to get

00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:33,210
together and learn together we also do

00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,970
consulting culture consulting for

00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:39,840
technologies who are looking to be

00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:44,160
become more inclusive this is a map of

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:47,430
the United States it's also a map of all

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,340
of 13 of our chapters so check this out

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,350
if you're in one of these cities

00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:54,750
definitely feel free to connect our goal

00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:57,300
is actually to be in 24 different cities

00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:59,340
by this time next year and we're always

00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:02,250
looking for diverse volunteers to help

00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:04,200
us create those chapters leave those

00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:07,920
chapters run workshops in those chapters

00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:10,530
our goal is to have all of the

00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,270
volunteers reflect how we want the world

00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:15,060
to look so we want everyone regardless

00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:17,790
of race regardless of gender regardless

00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:20,040
of background working together to solve

00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:23,240
problems rather than having this just be

00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:28,800
a women's issue that women are solving

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:30,660
are you still counting them if you if

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,640
you look on our website you'll see a

00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,960
chick tech net org slash locations and

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,740
then you might be a little confused

00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:40,200
because I believe we only have ten of

00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,479
the chapters up there right now we have

00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,010
three really brand new chapters and

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,840
there they're not allowed to have their

00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:48,540
locations up until they get their

00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:51,210
website up to date like it can't be

00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:54,780
talking about other cities still it's

00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:56,040
just not cool so there are a lot of

00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:58,920
different ways that you can get involved

00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,560
in chick tech volunteering is a big one

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,170
we are almost completely volunteer run

00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,030
at this point all of the chapters are

00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:09,000
volunteer run I'm actually the only

00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:10,980
full-time employee but we're trying to

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,070
work on that as you can see we have a

00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:16,500
program director position open and again

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,910
that is open to everyone we do not

00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,450
discriminate based on gender because

00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:23,450
that would be somewhat anathema to

00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:25,370
we're trying to do we are looking for

00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:27,050
not just technical volunteers although

00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:29,300
technical volunteers are very important

00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:32,260
if you have skills and project

00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:37,040
management program management marketing

00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:38,870
fundraising and just helping to inspire

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,600
people and get them excited about the

00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:45,260
mission definitely let us know as you

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,810
saw let's see if we can go back as you

00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,970
saw in here any email for the locations

00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:51,770
is basically city name at chick dick org

00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:54,590
so if you're in Atlanta it's Atlanta

00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:57,260
chick tech org feel free to reach out to

00:09:54,590 --> 00:10:01,010
them and see what help they're looking

00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:04,040
for also funding of course as a

00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:05,750
non-profit most of our donations at this

00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,570
point come from corporations and

00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:14,150
individuals especially to run the local

00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:17,090
programs we're also looking for hosts so

00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:18,920
if you're working in a company that has

00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:22,840
a space and you love having people come

00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:25,130
into those space spaces we need to have

00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:29,990
we need space for both our high school

00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:32,210
events and our career events so now of

00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:34,370
course you're clearly wondering how such

00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:38,180
an amazing and glorious organization

00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:40,400
came to be so chick tech is based on my

00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,710
experiences and the barriers that I ran

00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:45,230
into as I was growing up and as a young

00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:47,870
woman doing computer engineering in

00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:53,480
college it's basically what I wish I had

00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:56,060
had at both of those times so this is

00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:00,020
where I grew up this is the middle of

00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:03,860
nowhere in Wisconsin and yes we did have

00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:06,620
a dairy farm I've we lived about 15

00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:10,640
miles out of town which was the thriving

00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:13,310
metropolis of Medford Wisconsin we have

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,160
they currently actually have just over

00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:20,300
2,200 people there and we actually lived

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,890
closer to a town of 500 Medford is

00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:26,480
actually where I went to where I went to

00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:29,000
high school as dairy farmers especially

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,950
independent dairy farmers we were on the

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
verge of bankruptcy almost the entire

00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:37,520
time

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,920
and between that and living in a really

00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:43,960
rural area there were very very few

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,960
opportunities for me to get involved in

00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:49,160
even just living so far out and having

00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,890
my parents and I be so busy working on

00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:55,540
the farm just driving back and forth was

00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:58,310
almost too much to ask I still remember

00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:02,090
getting these really shiny brochures

00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:04,640
about these summer camps for for gifted

00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:07,880
youth that they were inviting me to and

00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,230
I almost didn't even talk about it with

00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,790
my parents because I knew it wasn't

00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,260
going to be possible even though they

00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,700
offered scholarships we still wouldn't

00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,430
be able to pay for the plane ticket and

00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,930
my parents wouldn't be able to deal with

00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:22,430
the farm without me there during the

00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:25,400
summer so this is one of the one of the

00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:29,000
lessons that I learned growing up is

00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:31,850
that even small things can get in the

00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,170
way of your success or of trying new

00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:38,660
things and my experience has helped me

00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:41,390
to create a program that works to lower

00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:43,820
those barriers and open the door in that

00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:46,580
glass wall to youth that might otherwise

00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:49,310
not be able to join our chick tech high

00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:52,130
school program is free we provide all

00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:57,230
meals that we possibly can we feed them

00:12:52,130 --> 00:13:00,080
a lot I really like food we provide

00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:02,600
childcare stipends for teen parents we

00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,860
provide transportation help as needed so

00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:08,030
we either pick up the girls at their

00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:10,280
school or we provide transit passes that

00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:12,050
we send to them in advance because the

00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:16,010
girls that we really want to reach and

00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:19,130
the girls that can really do something

00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:21,410
with the programs that we're offering to

00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:22,910
them a five-dollar transit pass may be a

00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:28,520
barrier that they're not able to get

00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:31,790
over in 2001 I graduated from high

00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:34,970
school and somewhere around there there

00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:38,660
was a tech boom and then tech tech bust

00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:41,120
I was not aware of it at the time being

00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,800
in a rural public school we were not

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,920
necessarily on the cutting edge of

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,060
technology and any

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:51,029
way shape or form I had no programming

00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:53,220
experience until I started my first but

00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:58,230
not my last c programming class in

00:13:53,220 --> 00:14:00,449
college as a teenager you can go through

00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:03,180
your teen years completely oblivious

00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:05,070
you're basically you know of course now

00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:08,699
we have the internet and I I understand

00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:11,430
that but a lot of what you're exposed to

00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:13,889
is what adult the adults around you

00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:15,510
expose you to so if you don't know to

00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:16,440
search for something on the internet or

00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,610
you don't know that something's

00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,399
interesting you're still not going to

00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:22,199
find it right same thing like if you

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,209
have a library of books you can go and

00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:26,670
you can browse that library but if you

00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:28,230
only have Amazon and you just have a

00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:30,990
search box and you don't know what to

00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:32,730
search for the chances of you finding

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:35,880
things that are outside what you've been

00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:38,190
exposed to are much slimmer our goal

00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,410
with chick tech is to expose the girls

00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:43,440
in our program to opportunities that

00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:45,120
they haven't thought to try yet we work

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,040
with high schools and we get high school

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,140
teachers to nominate girls to our

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,149
program again specifically focusing on

00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,850
the girls they wouldn't usually nominate

00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:56,149
to a technology program but who they

00:14:53,850 --> 00:15:00,060
feel have an aptitude to succeed in it

00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:03,630
because the unusual suspects the girls

00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:06,240
who aren't choosing to opt in aren't

00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:09,060
going to look at our program in usually

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,949
and say oh well I've obliviously managed

00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,930
to avoid all other technology programs

00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:16,050
I'm going to magically choose this one

00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:18,750
now right and so we provide that

00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:20,490
encouragement through through our

00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,620
relationships with the teachers because

00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:24,930
it's always really no matter how old you

00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,519
are you can be 60 and if you're

00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:29,010
nominated for something you still feel

00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:35,739
pretty special right it's not it's not a

00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:38,149
thing that just just teenagers get so

00:15:35,739 --> 00:15:40,189
I'm assuming you all remember how it

00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:42,230
felt to be you know sophomores and

00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,939
juniors and seniors freaking out about

00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:47,329
what you're going to do with your life

00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:48,499
right also I have a teenage son that's

00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:49,939
something I don't really talk about in

00:15:48,499 --> 00:15:53,089
this but I was actually a teen parent I

00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:54,949
had my son when I was 16 and he got me

00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:58,639
addicted to I funny and that's both

00:15:54,949 --> 00:16:00,559
wonderful and really terrible so I

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,329
actually found this one like five days

00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,669
ago and I saved it to my phone just in

00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:07,009
case I wanted to use it in the stock so

00:16:04,669 --> 00:16:08,929
by now you're probably wondering how did

00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:12,829
I end up in technology when all the

00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:15,199
signs pointed to me not going in so it

00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:17,989
was actually a pretty random comment by

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,790
my grandma I was talking on the phone

00:16:17,989 --> 00:16:21,199
with her one time and she's like you

00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:23,089
know you're pretty good at engineering

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:26,629
I'm sorry you're pretty good at math why

00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:30,619
don't you try engineering and I was like

00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:32,660
oh I had never thought of that and she

00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:34,879
probably doesn't even remember saying

00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:37,100
that comment because as an adult you say

00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,209
random things and they make sense at the

00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,819
time but they're not important to you

00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:42,980
but to a teenager especially when you're

00:16:40,819 --> 00:16:44,029
freaking out and having no idea because

00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,589
you think you're supposed to choose a

00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:48,589
career and stick with it for the rest of

00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:55,100
your life those kinds of comments can

00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:59,809
change your path so one of the things

00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:01,789
that we see with our our participants

00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:04,069
especially the more at-risk youth that

00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:07,909
we serve is that they don't have a lot

00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:10,279
of adult mentors and we really make it

00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:14,360
part of our mission to provide those

00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:17,360
both formally and informally we work to

00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:20,750
have a student to volunteer ratio of

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,399
three-to-one because we want every young

00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,470
woman in our program to have the

00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:26,329
opportunity to talk to as many people in

00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:30,200
technology as possible because you don't

00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:32,510
know when one person that that girl may

00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,909
really identify with or really look up

00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:38,289
to will say that one random thing that

00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:38,289
puts them on this amazing path

00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:48,600
so I started college the summer that I

00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:51,720
graduated from high school so I knew

00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:54,360
very little about technology I didn't

00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,970
know anything about what programming was

00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,550
or even really what it was used for I

00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,350
had read like you remember and guidance

00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:04,020
counselors or career counselors offices

00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:07,320
they had like these books and they had

00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,490
like one page on each career anyway so

00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,200
that's what I had read about computer

00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:13,430
engineering when I chose it so that's

00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,660
all I knew I knew so little about

00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:18,000
technology and engineering that I didn't

00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,910
realize until I started that I didn't

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,840
belong as a woman I had no idea that

00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:26,820
that gender gap existed so my electrical

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,910
and computer engineering department had

00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:31,500
eight percent women at the time I think

00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:33,930
they've actually gone down a little bit

00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:38,010
in the last ten years i graduated in

00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:40,200
2006 and i looked around at all the

00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:43,530
pretty much all guys and they all seemed

00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,900
so confident they had been programming

00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,520
for much longer than i had which it was

00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:51,450
you know zero so it wasn't really that

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:53,970
hard but I knew that I didn't feel

00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,860
confident and the way that they were

00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,690
solving problems are looking at problems

00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,940
were different than i wanted to solve

00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,470
them and i just assumed that how they

00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,270
were trying to solve the problems must

00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:06,110
be the right way because they they

00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:11,370
seemed so sure of what they were doing

00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:13,740
and the classes were done in a way that

00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:16,080
wasn't really conducive to my learning

00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,660
for me personally I have to know the big

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,880
picture I need to know what the entire

00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,830
system does and how the parts work

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,360
together before I learned the

00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:27,750
step-by-step instructions on how to

00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,430
build this particular module and how

00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,110
they teach engineering as you learn

00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,760
step-by-step how to create this little

00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:34,080
module and then you move to the next

00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,640
little module and then you learn

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,990
step-by-step how to create that and

00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:43,290
without that big umbrella of knowledge

00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:44,880
over how all of that work together that

00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:47,280
was pretty lost on me I mean I still got

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,350
really good grades but I don't have pets

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,570
I don't have the knowledge that I feel

00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:52,340
like I would have had

00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:56,720
otherwise and that was very stressful to

00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:59,419
me so it felt like I wasn't as good at

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,279
it as what other people were even though

00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:04,220
it was really just how things were

00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:06,590
taught on top of all of that it felt

00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:10,190
like everyone was watching and waiting

00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:12,559
for me to make a mistake to show that

00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:16,179
women didn't actually belong in

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:19,730
engineering and it's amazing how

00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:22,789
important that sense of belonging is to

00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:25,340
all of us it really drives our lives and

00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:27,679
we don't notice it until we don't have

00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:31,340
it and that's a very uncomfortable and

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:33,080
stressful feeling so there's different

00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,730
ways that we search for that community

00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,429
in that sense of belonging they can be

00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:41,480
negative where kids bully and tease

00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:43,909
others to try to fit in or gangs people

00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:47,330
are willing to literally kill to get

00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:48,620
that sense of belonging or community and

00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,909
that sense of belonging can be found in

00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,470
really positive ways and that's

00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:54,080
obviously what we're trying to create

00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:58,100
with chick tech less killing more

00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:01,519
community we're really working to create

00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:04,190
a an empowering and supportive community

00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:06,289
that can help combat the discouragement

00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,779
and negativity that the women and girls

00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:11,799
who are going into technology are

00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:16,610
looking to go into technology maybe

00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:18,200
maybe dealing with so I'd like to say

00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:20,389
that that's all of a sudden where I

00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,669
created chick tech but that would make

00:21:20,389 --> 00:21:26,059
for way to clean and need of a story so

00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:27,799
what actually happened was that I gave

00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:29,299
in to my imposter syndrome I have been

00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:30,889
dealing with some sexual harassment and

00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:33,889
discrimination issues in the technology

00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:35,840
industry during college and during my

00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:38,450
internships and I chose to leave

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:42,409
technology instead I went back and I got

00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:45,309
my MBA and then I worked for what we

00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:51,259
will fondly call the worst company ever

00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:53,029
and that company showed me the great and

00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:55,580
useful fact that technology is not

00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:57,500
actually the worst place for sexual

00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:00,429
harassment discrimination so that's I

00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:04,720
guess good

00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:07,149
I ended up quitting I did consulting for

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,399
a year or so and then I ended up

00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:11,830
volunteering at a program that was

00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:14,679
working to get more minority youth into

00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:17,200
technology and I left that experience

00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:21,129
really excited about the ideas that I

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:24,340
came up with on how to get more girls

00:22:21,129 --> 00:22:26,619
into technology as well and I use those

00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:29,409
ideas to create chick deck and that was

00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:30,999
late 2011 when I started talking a lot

00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:34,149
about it which is how I start things and

00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:38,110
then in 2012 i managed to get a group of

00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:40,269
volunteers and we started planning for

00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:45,789
our first event which was January of

00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:48,610
2013 with 99 girls in Portland I do

00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:51,249
really miss coding that's something i

00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:53,860
really enjoyed especially embedded

00:22:51,249 --> 00:22:55,929
programming being able to code something

00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:58,929
over here and have it changed something

00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:01,960
over here was pretty awesome but i

00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:04,570
really like being able to open the doors

00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,929
to technology to those people who are

00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:10,539
running into that glass wall so let's

00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:13,330
briefly look at why organizations like

00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:16,720
chick tech exists so here is the state

00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:18,700
of the industry in to statistics the

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,190
pipeline eighteen percent of computer

00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:24,039
science majors are women and in

00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:30,639
retention we lose fifty six percent of

00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:31,539
computer science women by mid career so

00:23:30,639 --> 00:23:34,869
this has been a problem for a while

00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:37,869
right like we know for a lot of us know

00:23:34,869 --> 00:23:41,559
that the number or percentage of women

00:23:37,869 --> 00:23:45,159
in computer science peaked in about 87

00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:48,399
88 at thirty-seven percent and it's been

00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:51,070
going down since and we have a lot of

00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:52,960
organizations working on this why is

00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:54,970
this problem not solved right it seems

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,619
like we should just get more women in

00:23:54,970 --> 00:24:00,039
and then not to get rid of them and then

00:23:56,619 --> 00:24:03,490
it will magically all be fixed right so

00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:06,429
I have three different main reasons that

00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:10,629
I believe that this is that progress has

00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:13,610
been that progress has been slower than

00:24:10,629 --> 00:24:16,520
we would really like to see one is

00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:18,860
and this is a pretty big one the root of

00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:21,130
the problem is a global societal issue

00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:24,950
that has nothing to do with technology

00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:27,260
to a majority of people still don't see

00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:30,049
gender equity as an issue in technology

00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:31,790
and three people have a hard time taking

00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:34,910
responsibility for the part that they

00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:37,130
play so let's break down the idea that

00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:40,520
this is not a tech issue we're going to

00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:45,919
start at a micro level and then go to

00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:48,940
more global so one we see this issue in

00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:51,530
way more places than just technology

00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:53,419
this is an interesting phenomenon that I

00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:56,120
had not heard of but I appreciated that

00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:58,580
it used the word glass so that it would

00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,640
fit very nicely into my talk so the

00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:05,360
glass escalator the glass escalator is a

00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:08,809
phenomenon where men who were in women

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:11,000
dominated fields get paid more than the

00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:15,140
women coworker their women co-workers

00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,190
and get promoted more quickly and you

00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,450
could look at that you could be like

00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,490
well that's kind of fair you know

00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:22,660
there's not very many of them you know

00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:25,610
the hospitals are probably looking for

00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:28,429
for diversity as well you know it's just

00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:30,860
supply and demand right except that we

00:25:28,429 --> 00:25:32,720
don't see that in male-dominated careers

00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:35,150
for women if you look at construction

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,690
women construction workers aren't paid

00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:41,270
more if you look at tech female tech

00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:45,049
workers are also not paid more we still

00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:47,270
have a wage gap and if you look at all

00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:50,210
of the data of what we actually have is

00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:53,660
an implicit bias that values men's

00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:56,000
contributions over women's contributions

00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:58,760
pretty much across the board I have not

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,200
found an exception in this and it's

00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,450
really interesting because you look at

00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:06,740
nursing and you think well that should

00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:09,830
be in our stereotype of a like perfect a

00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:11,540
perfect hospital nurse you look at you

00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:13,640
look at them and you think okay this is

00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:15,320
definitely going to be a woman right our

00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,030
stereotype says women are caregivers

00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,190
women are nurturers they're so

00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:23,780
empathetic that's who I want taking care

00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:25,049
of me and if that's true in a career

00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:27,419
like

00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:31,470
nursing where we have those really

00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:33,239
strong stereotypes how much harder is it

00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:34,710
in somewhere than like somewhere in

00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:36,419
technology or where we have the

00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:42,539
stereotype that that's not how women's

00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:44,340
brains work as another example women

00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:47,759
represent fifty-three percent of new

00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:52,559
hires and then basically get funneled

00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:55,980
out of the going up the ladder until we

00:26:52,559 --> 00:27:01,440
get five having only 5% of CEOs be women

00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:05,039
in the fortune 500 it's also bigger than

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:09,720
just business when we look at the state

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:12,119
legislature state legislation in the US

00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,559
fifty one percent of the population as

00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:16,049
women and twenty percent of the

00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:17,820
population is women of color but when

00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:20,759
you look at our legislators only

00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:23,220
twenty-five percent of legislators are

00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:26,009
women and only five percent are women of

00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:28,379
color that means that women do not have

00:27:26,009 --> 00:27:34,980
a representative say on issues that

00:27:28,379 --> 00:27:38,820
affect their lives so we know we have a

00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:41,580
problem globally when this map exists

00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:45,450
the fact that we have to have a map that

00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:47,309
shows us where women are most threatened

00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:51,659
and least threatened in terms of

00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:54,529
physical safety really shows this is not

00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:57,570
just a technical issue technology issue

00:27:54,529 --> 00:28:00,210
attitudes towards women across the globe

00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:03,090
place women in second class citizens

00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:05,730
status they're educated less paid less

00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:08,820
have fewer opportunities and in general

00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:12,600
are just not valued as humans as much as

00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:15,659
men are we live in a world where women

00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:17,759
are basically sold to older men in

00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:19,350
marriage as children where there are

00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:22,739
places that women are not allowed to

00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:24,269
drive and there are places where women

00:28:22,739 --> 00:28:27,239
aren't allowed to show their faces in

00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:31,279
public that tells me that women being

00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:33,419
treated and paid less than men in

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:35,899
technology is not just an isolated

00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:35,899
incident

00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:40,140
so I'm not telling you all of this to

00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,790
discourage you and tell you that

00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:45,030
whatever you're doing in technology is

00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:46,740
not worth it my goal is really to show

00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:49,320
you that when you're looking for root

00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:51,000
causes if you only look in technology

00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,370
and at processes and procedures in the

00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,140
tech industry you're going to miss the

00:28:53,370 --> 00:29:00,390
main root causes and it's going to make

00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:02,550
it harder for you to have an impact so

00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:07,200
just remember technology does not exist

00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:10,170
in a bubble and our society supersedes

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,170
all bounds between between these

00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:18,210
different industries and our communities

00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:20,430
and our our communities in our society

00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:32,310
will always affect your industry no

00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:36,180
matter what it is sorry so issue number

00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:38,490
two people still aren't seeing the issue

00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:41,940
there was a study that came out in March

00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:43,980
that showed that sixty-six percent of

00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,710
men and thirty percent of women in the

00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:48,300
technology industry believe men and

00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,670
women have equal opportunities and

00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:53,940
technology despite all evidence and

00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:56,130
anecdotes to the contrary i was actually

00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:58,170
this sounds kind of weird i was kind of

00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:00,270
excited about this these statistics

00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:03,000
because i had been talking for a while

00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:06,360
about this sense that I got that we had

00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,730
this silent majority of people that are

00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,350
making it so much harder for us to

00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:12,510
create change and it's not that they're

00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:14,460
bad people they just don't believe

00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:16,620
there's an issue and so they're not

00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,420
pulling us back into the stone ages but

00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:23,970
they're there anchoring us down and

00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:26,730
making it harder to make change so part

00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:29,940
of this issue is the meritocracy myth

00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:32,250
the meritocracy myth is very inviting

00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:36,690
right we all want to believe that we got

00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:38,850
to where we're at because of how great

00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:41,460
we are as people right or how how

00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:43,830
talented we are and a lot of that's true

00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:47,160
right we all have helped you know we all

00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:49,950
have family members or mentors who

00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:52,649
helped us along the way and that's great

00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:55,380
the problem is is the inequality in who

00:30:52,649 --> 00:30:57,240
gets those mentors and who gets that

00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:01,460
help and who has somebody showing them

00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:04,049
the way to that door in that glass wall

00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:07,080
we have all these people who are

00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:09,210
different than the norm or different in

00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,700
technology or different than the

00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:13,590
stereotype who are still outside that

00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,799
glass wall and they can't find their way

00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:19,260
in to compete on a level playing field

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,730
they may have more qualifications they

00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,019
may have the same qualifications but

00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:26,880
those are viewed as less because of

00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:29,669
unconscious bias but overall treating

00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,370
technology like a meritocracy keeps

00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:34,169
people on the out excuse me keeps

00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:37,529
diverse people on the outside and that

00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:40,470
makes for a less than great workplace

00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:48,840
not as great of a product and not the

00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:50,639
society that we want so this is kind of

00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,669
a hard one right because the mentality

00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:55,260
that this is someone else's problem is

00:31:52,669 --> 00:31:56,850
really pervasive and a lot of it's

00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,980
because we just don't know how to fix it

00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:01,260
right it's a really complex issue it's

00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:03,169
an issue that goes back to since the

00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:07,760
dawn of time in terms of gender any

00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:11,880
inequity and we only have so much

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:14,820
emotional bandwidth right I actually got

00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:18,269
a book and I was going to put it on this

00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:23,010
slide but it's the life-changing magic

00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:24,419
of not giving a you know because we

00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:26,190
really can only care about so many

00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:27,990
things before we get emotionally

00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:31,799
overwhelmed and aren't able to effect

00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:33,539
change in anything however regardless of

00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:35,850
how much emotional energy you feel that

00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:38,460
you have or don't have to fight for

00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:40,799
gender equity in tech remember that your

00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:43,909
actions are what build or pull down that

00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:46,529
glass wall every day for others

00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:49,080
unconscious bias is a very real thing

00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:51,720
and if you don't work to control it it

00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:54,480
will control your actions and have real

00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:57,960
consequences for those around you it may

00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,299
be the system it may be society but

00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,270
those aren't static things created by

00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:07,620
someone else they're created by us

00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:10,010
and us includes everyone in this room so

00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:15,360
who's taken an implicit bias test online

00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:17,580
through Harvard or whatever okay who's

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:21,530
done in a implicit bias or unconscious

00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:26,100
bias training in person anybody a couple

00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:29,970
okay so that's great I strongly

00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:31,440
encourage all of you to do so I'm

00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:34,260
planning on sending out these slides

00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:40,170
later so feel free to grab these links

00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:43,440
or look for them on the Internet the the

00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:47,430
links right there so implicit bias is

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:52,470
very important in terms of looking at

00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:56,490
how we can improve our how we can

00:33:52,470 --> 00:34:02,160
improve our our workplace and in general

00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:06,030
our society it's a taking the implicit

00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,290
bias test and looking for looking for

00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:09,750
different trainings and learning more

00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:12,510
are really important and essential first

00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:14,899
steps it will help you to set yourself

00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:18,330
up or examining your thinking and

00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:20,480
understanding how that might be playing

00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:24,090
into your life so that you can start

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:27,510
changing it and in general being able to

00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:29,760
create change once you take it don't

00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:32,429
stop there what they've actually found

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,830
is that people who take an implicit bias

00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:37,440
test or do just a one-hour unconscious

00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:39,899
bias training are actually less likely

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,669
to make a change because they think that

00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:44,070
since everybody has it and it's

00:34:41,669 --> 00:34:48,200
something that they can't control they

00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:48,200
don't have to change and that's not true

00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:54,690
just one person choosing to stand up in

00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:56,330
their company or at a conference or in

00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:59,190
their neighborhood will create change

00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:01,650
you may not change the world but you may

00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:03,300
change the world for one person and in

00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:06,740
doing so you can start breaking down

00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,740
your part of that glass wall

00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,610
okay so this is our first activity we're

00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:18,460
going to be looking at stereotypes in

00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:21,490
tech and in general in your life I'd

00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:23,230
like to have all of you get together in

00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:25,680
groups of three or four depending on

00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:30,210
what works out best for your area and

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:33,610
take about 5-7 minutes to talk about

00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:36,100
what stereotypes you see in technology

00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:37,990
and business and how do you think that

00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:45,640
these are negatively affecting people

00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:47,830
and the business or tech industry so

00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:50,410
does anyone have any interesting

00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:52,380
stereotypes that may not have been

00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:54,700
typical ones that people thought about

00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:59,590
or that other people may have thought

00:35:54,700 --> 00:36:02,830
about that you'd like to share in the

00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:09,090
dark we're apparently keeping this

00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:12,040
anonymous so i think i won there's love

00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:14,280
ageism in tech so like those lock

00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:16,210
companies and Silicon Valley on tech

00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,520
industry that think that just young

00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:20,230
people are smarter or better and they

00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:22,630
possibly don't want to hire people who

00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:24,970
are older because maybe they're set in

00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:27,520
their ways or they do not culture fit so

00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:29,440
i think that's that's something kind of

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,600
prevalent we have to watch out for yeah

00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,300
yeah definitely i was reading something

00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:37,090
that said that you basically are over

00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:43,180
the hill in technology once you reach 30

00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:46,260
which is crazy we have several peoples

00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,260
who are not too old right now

00:36:46,969 --> 00:36:53,309
huh so my current company which I

00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:55,499
actually like a lot despite this

00:36:53,309 --> 00:36:58,199
complaint a lot of the folks who were

00:36:55,499 --> 00:37:00,749
there when I was originally hired were

00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:05,489
big into sports and going out drinking

00:37:00,749 --> 00:37:09,149
and they would just get blasted um a lot

00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:10,889
and that's that's not my thing and they

00:37:09,149 --> 00:37:13,229
weren't really into board games or RPGs

00:37:10,889 --> 00:37:16,139
or you know the sorts of stereotypical

00:37:13,229 --> 00:37:17,429
geeky things that I think a lot of the

00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:21,539
people who showed up at board game night

00:37:17,429 --> 00:37:24,029
at least her into and it's it's actually

00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:26,489
been quite nice as more people have come

00:37:24,029 --> 00:37:30,989
on to the company being able to find

00:37:26,489 --> 00:37:32,789
people who are geeks so I realize that's

00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:34,889
odd in a tech thing that I couldn't find

00:37:32,789 --> 00:37:41,189
a lot of them really were you know

00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:43,589
sports Bros any guys okay yes the

00:37:41,189 --> 00:37:45,329
converse of that I guess actually so

00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:47,549
definitely brogrammer culture is a thing

00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:49,369
but oh so the stereotype that being

00:37:47,549 --> 00:37:58,130
nerdy makes you a better programmer

00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:58,130
don't think it does hey all right yes

00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:04,769
one that we discussed was around

00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:09,299
paternity and maternity leave and the

00:38:04,769 --> 00:38:11,159
assumptions that the mother is going to

00:38:09,299 --> 00:38:12,749
want to stay home where the father is

00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:13,649
going to be useless during that time and

00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,959
therefore shouldn't get as much

00:38:13,649 --> 00:38:17,699
paternity leave or just everything in

00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:23,059
our culture around what happens when you

00:38:17,699 --> 00:38:23,059
have a child yeah definitely one more

00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:36,650
we were saying about when you be

00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:39,079
respected as a programmer to work you

00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:40,819
know and code at your job but if you're

00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:42,859
really into it if you're one a tough

00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:45,890
program you also have to have side

00:38:42,859 --> 00:38:47,960
projects related to coding I mean you

00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:55,280
can have hobbies outside of it you're a

00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:57,609
really good programmer yeah great okay

00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:01,970
thanks everyone for doing that exercise

00:38:57,609 --> 00:39:06,290
our next one is around micro

00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:08,480
affirmations have if anyone has anyone

00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:12,230
heard of micro affirmations or micro

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,960
inequities or micro aggressions yeah a

00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:17,510
pretty good majority of you so micro

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,140
affirmations so it in general I found

00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:20,540
that people have heard of

00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:22,430
microaggressions but possibly not micro

00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:24,440
information so microaggressions or micro

00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:27,260
inequities are often subconscious things

00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:30,800
that you're doing to tell other people

00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:33,200
that they're not as valuable or not as

00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,520
not worth as much or that they don't

00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,000
belong and you don't even realize that

00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:42,680
you're doing it Micro affirmations are a

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:45,140
way that you can change how you're

00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:47,210
behaving but not through policing

00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:49,400
yourself until you can't do anything

00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:52,730
around anyone but rather changing it by

00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:55,280
doing something really positive so what

00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:56,960
I'd like to have you all do probably in

00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:01,220
your same groups feel free to mix it up

00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:04,910
if you really want to is look at some of

00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:06,619
these interesting situations where

00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:08,390
negative stereotypes might come into

00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:11,720
play and say you had the opportunity

00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:14,089
you're standing in the the line at a

00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:17,540
grocery store or you're at a tech event

00:40:14,089 --> 00:40:20,200
or you're at you know helping you work

00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:22,369
at a hardware store I don't know but

00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,230
what you know you had the opportunity to

00:40:22,369 --> 00:40:27,619
engage in a really brief conversation

00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:30,290
but that with these people and what how

00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:31,970
could you give them micro affirmations

00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:34,910
that acknowledged their value or

00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:38,690
accomplishments or their ability to

00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:40,609
belong as you know right rightfully in

00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:41,660
that group and promote feelings of

00:40:40,609 --> 00:40:45,049
inclusion and care

00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:48,349
and then how can you use this concept in

00:40:45,049 --> 00:40:50,390
your workplace to fight the stereotypes

00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:56,000
such as what we just talked about in the

00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:58,670
last exercise great thank you so we are

00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:02,569
almost out of time but I'd like to hear

00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:04,609
from just two people really quick on if

00:41:02,569 --> 00:41:08,240
in your group there was a really

00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:09,410
interesting micro affirmation and or how

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,130
you might want to use that in the

00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:24,289
workplace can we please stop saying guys

00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:25,609
just say y'all instead one thing that

00:41:24,289 --> 00:41:27,740
got brought up in our group that I think

00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:30,349
applies to multiple of these is if you

00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:32,150
see someone in a non stereotypical

00:41:30,349 --> 00:41:33,559
situation right you see a home in a

00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:36,109
hardware store or women that tech meetup

00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:38,030
don't ask if you can help them but ask

00:41:36,109 --> 00:41:39,799
what they're doing so what project are

00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:41,569
you working on or you know what are you

00:41:39,799 --> 00:41:50,930
building not hey can I help you with

00:41:41,569 --> 00:41:53,299
that right so I don't think we have

00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:56,270
enough time to do activity number three

00:41:53,299 --> 00:42:01,609
but I'd love for everyone to think about

00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:03,500
this and you know just in general keep

00:42:01,609 --> 00:42:06,079
in mind what you've learned today and

00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:07,430
see what kinds of just little changes

00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,809
you don't even those little micro

00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:12,289
affirmations if you could do one of

00:42:08,809 --> 00:42:15,440
those a day and help people feel more

00:42:12,289 --> 00:42:17,150
welcome that would be a pretty big

00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:22,069
change especially for that person who

00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:23,900
received that I do have some interesting

00:42:22,069 --> 00:42:25,700
resources a couple different terms

00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:28,430
misrepresentation has anyone heard of

00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:31,430
this film has anybody watched it yeah

00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:35,630
it's a really good it's also really

00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:39,710
angering but it a good like righteous

00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:41,859
way I think so keep that in mind but

00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:45,230
it's on netflix as everything should be

00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:48,319
but that will definitely change the way

00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:50,150
you look at our media and how women and

00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:53,150
girls are portrayed in it and especially

00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:55,520
if you have children of the girl variety

00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:57,140
you'll want to watch this week

00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:02,960
you'll these are things that you'll need

00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:05,570
to counteract as as parents and this is

00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:08,030
the last thing that I would like to

00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:09,950
leave you all with let us make our

00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:13,040
future now and let us make our dreams

00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:14,960
tomorrow reality this is actually on the

00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:20,740
back of our last year's tic tac t-shirts

00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:20,740
