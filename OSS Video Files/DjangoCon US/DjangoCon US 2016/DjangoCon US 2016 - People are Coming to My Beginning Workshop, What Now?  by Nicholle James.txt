	People are Coming to My Beginning Workshop, What Now?  by Nicholle James

Volunteers often love running introductory programming workshops. This talk covers how to help attendees get the most out of your volunteer time. Weâ€™ll look at how to make a tutorial easier for attendees to follow and tips that help students stay relaxed and learn effectively. The talk incorporates what I learned as a student teacher and includes a new source of help in revising newcomer material.

This talk was presented at: https://2016.djangocon.us/schedule/presentation/25/

come on

00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,619
hi before i start i'm going to say my

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,830
thankies in advance because otherwise

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,660
i'm going to forget so Shh Laroy i don't

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,310
know if you know him but he helped with

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,430
the Boston ladies workshop and he helped

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:33,570
me out a lot with this and if you want

00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:38,630
to know the sources for my send me an

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,630
email I will get them to you alright

00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:50,910
alright so this is me in five pictures

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:53,699
hi um I love math so much that I majored

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:56,699
in it in school I should have a

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:59,100
bachelor's in math education if you want

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,050
to know why it should instead of do see

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,739
me afterwards it's a long story I don't

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:08,460
have time um I love pictures of silly

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:10,200
cats all right you will probably never

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,470
find me without some form of needlepoint

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,730
or cross stitch in my bag and the most

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,220
important part that you need to remember

00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:19,290
is that play the oboe and reason why

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,420
that's important is because if you look

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:25,320
at my contact information I am the oboe

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:27,360
check alright so and I really really

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,829
really want to help you that's why I'm

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,420
here today I'm not here to tell you that

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:33,630
you're wrong that you're doing things

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,360
bad I'm just here to try and give you

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:40,500
tips to make the user experience for

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:43,140
beginners to coding better all right so

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,719
you have got there let's talk about the

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,969
first thing that people see when it

00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:53,100
comes to your workshop and it's not you

00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:55,500
it is the title to your workshop so how

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,619
many of you here have taken say a linear

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,920
algebra class all right how many of you

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:05,549
take a single variable calculus

00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:07,439
multivariable calculus yay ok so in

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:09,590
three hours if I were to tell you in

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,450
three hours my workshop is going to

00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,400
hey I'm going to make mini around the

00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:16,310
red single bolt or single and

00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:22,519
multivariable calculus simple what are

00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:24,890
you thinking one most people who have

00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:26,810
never seen these topics before are going

00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:29,390
to be made they're going to be like whoa

00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:33,140
I don't think it's ever going to be

00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:36,200
simple so let's put this in context of a

00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:38,660
topic that you know this is one that I

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,660
did not actually go to but this is a

00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:45,049
topic that I pulled from the pike on wet

00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,269
workshops a list practical analysis made

00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:50,750
simple okay well the first thing that I

00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:53,180
see is tactical analysis or practical

00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,610
network analysis okay great I want to

00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,049
know more about that I show up I find

00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:01,310
out that it's an intermediate level

00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:04,129
workshop okay if you're like me and most

00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:06,829
people are you don't read past the title

00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:09,200
you don't read what's in the description

00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:12,500
so you want to make sure that what is in

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,180
your title describes what you plan to do

00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,019
for your workshop and you don't want to

00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:20,720
promise things that you can't actually

00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:22,370
give so making something simple you're

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,030
not going to make it simple for everyone

00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:29,630
so well I can make something that is

00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:32,870
from multivariable calculus really easy

00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:35,450
for someone who is understands math

00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,720
really well I could not make it sound

00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:41,930
easy to someone who's only had algebra

00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:45,590
so instead of saying practical network

00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:47,389
analysis made simple why don't we pay an

00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,940
intermediate level guide to practical

00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:52,099
network analysis this tells us that it's

00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:56,359
an intermediate level workshop it also

00:03:52,099 --> 00:04:00,230
tells us that we're there to guide them

00:03:56,359 --> 00:04:03,319
in their journey of learning practical

00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:07,160
network analysis so when we're tying

00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:10,220
things it's very important that we label

00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,500
it so that they get as much information

00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,530
as possible because not everybody read

00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:19,849
the abstract so you want your title to

00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,810
be as descriptive as possible um that

00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:22,900
said

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:26,360
who's going to show up to your workshop

00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:32,990
well you have people who are like me who

00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:35,240
are clueless who may be things playing

00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,430
around with the computer but chances are

00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,930
this is the first time going to a coding

00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,550
thing they're really stepping out there

00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,000
this is really uncomfortable for them

00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:46,610
they're there because they want to learn

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,960
and then you're going to have people who

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,419
have degrees who are working in the

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,970
industry who I like to call the

00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:54,950
know-it-alls it's not a bad thing it

00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:58,520
just means that they already know a lot

00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:59,990
and you're not here for them you're here

00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,229
for people who are learning the

00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:05,660
beginners the people who are here who

00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:08,570
work in the industry or they have the

00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:12,560
degrees they can probably figure out

00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:15,260
your workshop even if you skip steps the

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,270
beginners are not going to be able to so

00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:19,490
make sure that when you're writing your

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:22,340
steps you're writing out as many of

00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:25,130
those steps as you can because if you go

00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,990
from step a two step g so who works in

00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:29,450
the industry will probably understand it

00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:31,850
but someone who's just starting out like

00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:33,640
me it's getting really frustrating

00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:37,039
because we're not going to realize that

00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:39,350
say we have to switch tabs and then in

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,419
that new tab we have to find a menu and

00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:43,160
there's like six menus and then wait

00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:44,720
find the right one we finally find the

00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,360
right one okay great and go down and

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,810
then we have to go to a side menu how

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:55,550
are we supposed to know this so make

00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:57,800
sure that you put every step in there if

00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:04,580
you need to screen shots and arrows are

00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:07,520
amazing um alright so what can you do if

00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:11,389
you show up and there's 20 to 50 people

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:14,570
and you have one too many no helpers

00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:17,270
what are you going to do well I can tell

00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:19,940
you how we do it the macworld how many

00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:22,610
of you taking math class so everybody

00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,889
right okay how many of you seen your

00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,360
teacher standing up in the front riding

00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:27,120
over the top board and then you're

00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,970
supposed to copy

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,540
notes okay well what do we call that in

00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:39,840
the programming world until that light

00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:42,930
coating all right so it happened it's a

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:51,780
practice that happens all the time okay

00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:54,270
well then you're Claudia's okay okay

00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,160
well this is good when you are in front

00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,919
of a bunch of people and you make

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,510
mistakes that does not mean that you're

00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:03,810
bad that you don't know what you're

00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:07,949
doing what it is is it saying hey I know

00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:09,780
how to make mistake it's okay people who

00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:12,870
are starting out are not comfortable

00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:15,120
making mistakes if you've ever liked

00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,590
gone to a new class and they tell you to

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,770
do something new and they ask for

00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:22,289
volunteer it's not often that you'll get

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:24,660
everybody to volunteer you maybe get one

00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:27,210
or two the reason could there not

00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:31,139
comfortable they're out of their zone so

00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:34,200
instead of like being upset about making

00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:38,580
a mistake no it's okay it's you teaching

00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:41,639
them so say you get a syntax error Hey

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,680
look I forgot a colon well three steps

00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,380
lay there you go again hey it's about a

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,810
cold again point it out every time

00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:51,210
because you can tell me hey ya know

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:53,099
everybody leaves at colins it happens

00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:55,320
all the time I'm not gonna believe you

00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:58,139
until I stay until I see it it's

00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:01,349
something that it happens we all know it

00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:03,360
happens but until you show it they're

00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:06,449
not going to believe you so keep that in

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:10,470
mind so now okay your light coating in

00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:13,110
front of a bunch of people you have say

00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:15,750
30 people everybody's asking questions

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:18,240
you're one person you can't answer

00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:21,750
everybody's questions so what can you do

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:26,160
to kind of help with that well hair

00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:29,880
programming is great so hair programming

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:34,800
two people one computer but then you go

00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:36,150
okay well I can do that but everybody

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,760
wants to do the workshop on their

00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:41,280
computer okay well that's fine we can

00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:44,450
adjust this a little bit so what I would

00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,830
like to do is I'd say okay everybody wig

00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:48,660
let's just pretend three or more years

00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,460
of experience we're going to put you on

00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,230
that wall everybody else for putting you

00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,250
on that wall okay once you have

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,080
everybody separate we're going to take

00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,390
one person in this well one person on

00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,660
this wall where you put you together

00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:02,190
okay every less experienced person is

00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,200
going to have a more experienced person

00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:06,720
with them the first thing you tell them

00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,670
to do is ok I want you to talk to the

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,300
person next to you before you talk to me

00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:15,890
if you can't figure it out then you ask

00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:18,330
me by doing this you will eliminate

00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:21,900
somewhere between a third to half the

00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:25,710
questions that are there and they get to

00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:27,420
have the added bonus of figuring it out

00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:29,940
for themselves which means that they're

00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:32,100
more likely to remember it so even if

00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:38,310
they have to ask someone else it's

00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:40,380
better than them asking you all right so

00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:42,710
let's go into why people ask questions

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,910
because this is a very important thing

00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:47,400
people ask questions because they don't

00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:51,090
understand what you're asking if I say

00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:53,310
hey hand me a clip well the question is

00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,080
am I asking you for paper clip am I

00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,180
asked me for you for a hair clip am I

00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,040
asking you for a clip to like clamp

00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:02,220
would but what am I asking you to do

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,080
well let's pretend that I want to have a

00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:07,830
clip to clip two pieces of wood together

00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:10,740
but you're thinking hey hair clip well

00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:12,660
if I go on google and I do are you going

00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,610
to google and you google hair clips and

00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:17,160
I don't know no you're doing like that

00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:20,340
blog well it doesn't matter how often

00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:23,750
you google hair clip you're not going to

00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:26,330
get would clamp so think of it as

00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:28,500
everybody has a different vocabulary

00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:32,580
nobody's going to be thinking the same

00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:34,680
thing and because of that googling it

00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,990
isn't going to be the best answer for

00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:41,070
everybody they may not know what

00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:42,140
question to ask so don't be upset if

00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:45,320
they ask

00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:49,250
question it's not them being stupid it's

00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:51,110
not them not understanding per se it's

00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:54,890
more of them not knowing what you're

00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:57,200
asking them to do so them asking

00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:59,930
questions also gives you a metric for

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,570
how well you are doing and lets you know

00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:10,430
what you need to fit so questions are

00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:12,920
very good um yes so what if they don't

00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:15,170
ask questions so here's a few

00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,510
suggestions because I know that I'm one

00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:19,910
of those people who I really hate like

00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,740
racing my hands and front of a bunch of

00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,240
people and being like hey I have this

00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,600
question and that's really not me

00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,910
there's a lot of people like me okay so

00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,560
what do you do is you have them so if

00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,150
you're standing in front you're doing is

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,650
kind of lecture style because you don't

00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:39,800
have any helpers well I love posts

00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:42,200
tickers so I can only find blue and

00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,270
yellow these are great because I could

00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:48,470
take okay stick this on the back of your

00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:51,050
laptop I'm doing well it just goes on

00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:54,620
the back of your laptop everybody behind

00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:56,480
them cannot see it if they have a

00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,910
question they can stick the other one on

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,160
there so the question is what if they're

00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:03,770
covered one well that's really easy to

00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:10,610
fix all you have to give it write a word

00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:13,430
on it these are really easy simple cheap

00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:15,530
you don't have to worry about it if say

00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:18,260
you want to ask a question putting it in

00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:20,600
a yes or no question will make it so

00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:22,400
that like they just have to stick it on

00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,320
the back of their computer they don't

00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,780
have to raise your hand it's really

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,650
simple gets everybody involved you can

00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:33,290
answer from everybody all right no

00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:36,500
guards no prints are great set out no

00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:39,260
card on every spot before the thing or

00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,300
have everybody pick up a note card this

00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,880
is anonymous all they do is they write

00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,640
their questions almost every workshop i

00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,230
went to there's been at least one break

00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,960
before the break you pick up all the

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:53,030
words you read through them chances are

00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,610
you'll find where there are holes in

00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:58,670
your workshop and you can go back and

00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:01,700
cover those things before you move on

00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:06,170
after the break it will help people a

00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:08,720
lot better last thing in this one's my

00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:11,660
favorite notebooks I love these little

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,910
notebooks that they provide I use them a

00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:17,090
lot you want to come see mine you can

00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:20,930
come see mine I need them for what

00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:26,090
functions our vocabulary words I don't

00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:27,500
know i like to use colored pens but not

00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,330
everybody has pens and if you're

00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,910
providing pens just like one pen will

00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:34,070
work it's just for them to write their

00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:36,170
notes if I have a question and there's

00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:38,060
no one around to answer it I can write

00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:41,510
the question down and league space and

00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:43,430
then move on so notebooks are great and

00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:46,520
the best part is they can take them home

00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:48,500
and then they take them home they can

00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,500
then use them for their own projects or

00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:53,720
for the next workshop that they go to

00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:59,870
that terrific it works out really really

00:13:53,720 --> 00:14:04,820
well so I'll give an example jingo girls

00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:08,570
they have probably the best summary for

00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:15,770
python that i have seen and i'm going to

00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:17,920
do something a little dangerous work all

00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,920
right

00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:24,740
alright so this is really really well

00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,970
written I have no problems with what's

00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,820
written here it's the problem that I

00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:32,060
have okay if you can watch the scroll

00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:33,620
bar okay we're going through streams we

00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:36,740
get to the hungry okay I've done a lot

00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,420
but look I'm not done I thought all this

00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:41,360
stuff left to do I'm not even it quarter

00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:43,760
to the way down you guys can't see this

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,690
the scroll bar is like an eighth of the

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:51,380
way down the page I guess it's there in

00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:56,300
the very very far corner um so having a

00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:59,690
lot on your page is really daunting I

00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:03,260
see this like I'm not that far down the

00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:05,149
page and I go oh my goodness I'm already

00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:08,329
feeling overwhelmed my brain is kind of

00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:11,149
done I don't want to keep going because

00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:14,300
I see how much more i have to do before

00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:18,410
i can even get started okay so how do we

00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:25,790
fix this will we break it up and we

00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:28,940
break it up alright so we break it up

00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:31,699
into small pages kind of like a

00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:33,199
PowerPoint you ever played a game like

00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:36,529
on the computer and you've had to click

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:41,050
a lot that clicking is there for a

00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:43,940
reason every time you click is a

00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:46,160
response to it sends a message to your

00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:49,339
brain saying hey something's happening

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,230
this is good so every time they have to

00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:53,750
flip a page they're not going to see

00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,610
that the book is really long they're

00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:58,339
just going to say hey look at these

00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:02,870
pages see how fast I'm going through

00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:04,550
them it's kind of like math books they

00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:08,149
don't give you the entire like five

00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:10,010
chapters they take them one chapter at a

00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:12,230
time and then each chapter is broken up

00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:15,829
into sections they do that to make it

00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:20,149
seem more doable so using that in

00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:21,440
programming it's really helpful and I'm

00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:23,199
going to talk about the next thing which

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,449
i think is super super important I

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:28,250
really really despise showing up for a

00:16:26,449 --> 00:16:30,650
workshop and the

00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:34,940
thing that I hear is oh hey I finish

00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:37,790
this last night which is great but my

00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,980
god is wonderful I'm going to be a test

00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:43,370
subject which means I'm not going to

00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,140
learn anything today because I'm going

00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,340
to get so far and we'll find a bug and

00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,380
then I'm gonna have to find someone to

00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:50,120
fix it my entire person is done fixing

00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,800
it they've skipped next six steps

00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,770
because they've had to work around it

00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:57,890
and sighs good success so I keep going

00:16:54,770 --> 00:17:00,920
find another bug someone has to fix it

00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:04,400
again skip another six dead so I am

00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:06,290
doing like three and ten steps and by

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,459
the time I'm done I don't remember

00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:13,610
anything I've not learned anything so

00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:17,720
it's really important that you test it

00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:20,420
before you go or before you run it when

00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,160
I was student teaching we had to turn in

00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:25,010
our lesson plans but we could not turn

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:28,160
them in until we had them checked by

00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:30,260
three other classmates it doesn't matter

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,090
if they're at the same level as you if

00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,670
they're more advanced than you if

00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:38,840
they're not as advanced as you they will

00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:43,810
find something test it please it will

00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:48,560
make everybody's life better and finally

00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:50,840
have an exit interview or a survey this

00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,760
is probably the most important thing

00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,090
that I'm going to say today because if

00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,820
you don't know how you're doing after

00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:00,500
you're done how are you going to fix it

00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:02,600
how do you know what you can make better

00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:05,030
and what you can't particularly if no

00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:09,880
one's talking to you if no one's talking

00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:13,880
to you then thank you good may be bad oh

00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:16,280
who knows okay so if you don't have it

00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:20,270
to the review email me I

00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:23,510
when you can use it um these are really

00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:27,320
important and it should be given in the

00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:28,610
last 15 minutes of your tutorial

00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,920
workshop and the reason why I say that

00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:32,360
is because you email it to them it's

00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:35,030
kind of like those surveys that they

00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:37,070
email you after you either gone to see a

00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,930
doctor or you've gone to a conference or

00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:40,910
something you see it in your email box

00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:42,620
and you're like okay well I don't have

00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:46,700
time to do that now I'll do it later and

00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:48,380
then later never happens so then doing

00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,780
it here while they're here they know it

00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,980
works they know what doesn't work they

00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,810
know what they like they know what they

00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:56,480
didn't like if they got to the end of

00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:58,670
the workshop what topic today when I

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,920
explore next if you want to write a

00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:03,380
different workshop you can find out all

00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:08,150
that information before they left the

00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:13,300
room it's really helpful so what should

00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:16,610
you remember where choices in word it

00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:20,570
right workshop for the beginner not for

00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:24,830
the advanced people who are there find

00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:29,810
alternative ways to get people to ask

00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:31,340
questions break it up no more than three

00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:33,290
