Description: 
	DjangoCon US 2016 - Pushing The Pony's Boundaries - Django Admin Customization by Ola Sitarska

1) Short introduction 
2) Run through available extension libraries and whatâ€™s possible in them: - Django Suit - Grappeli - Django Admin Tools 
3) Quick run through available Django Admin options. - list_display, list_filter, list_editable, search_fields, ordering, sortable - readonly_fields - raw_id_fields - fieldsets - actions 
4) Customizing Django Admin on your own. Letâ€™s create a super custom Django Admin together! The case study of DjangoGirls.org website, that supports a management system for various users who should be able to only manage pages theyâ€™re assigned to. - Limiting objects to users - Displaying computed fields in list page - Limiting add/edit forms for different types of users - Automatically saving information per user - Custom actions 
5) Summary - Instructions where to look for more information - Improve Admin (code.djangoproject.com, open source wohoo!) - Mention about Django Admin 2

hi hi everyone I'm really excited to be

00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,110
here he's my first Anglican us actually

00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:24,410
I've been doing tango prefer seven years

00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:25,910
but that's my first one I so I'm really

00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:31,880
excited to be here and it's been a long

00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:33,110
trip from and I know it's also been an

00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,780
exciting a really long day for you so

00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:38,920
really thank you for being here and for

00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:41,989
hearing my talk and now he's just on me

00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,830
standing for between you and the awesome

00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:47,270
bowling party so let's get started so

00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:49,040
we're gonna save a story so I have a

00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:51,380
little special bomb-proof jungle I mean

00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,450
so this is really like the first feature

00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,730
that sold me on Django and convinced me

00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:59,900
to switch from PHP to Python overnight I

00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:02,780
was like I was it also known as 14 and I

00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:06,290
spend my days playing with like games in

00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,810
the internet and and I built this I hope

00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,729
this game that lets you carry a flute

00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:13,430
while your child for real next nine

00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:14,810
months that was the game and the first

00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:19,039
feature i wrote for it was actually an

00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:21,710
acting interface and and I was I just

00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:23,780
learn PHP on my own and that's this

00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,079
whole sir begins and fuelie fearless

00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,909
leader

00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,399
I knew the PHP a little bit better and

00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:30,439
but I still felt like afternoons and

00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:31,789
holidays building really extensive am

00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:34,130
interfaces for people who actually

00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:35,329
managed the game and I was frustrating

00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,039
because I always felt that I could be

00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:39,139
I'm kind of wasting my time where I

00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:43,130
could be building a better way to you

00:01:39,139 --> 00:01:46,340
know change a diaper so then out of

00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:47,959
nowhere friends show me a jungle at me

00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,420
and told me it's actually just created

00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:52,310
mostly out of models and you have to do

00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,709
anything and I had no idea what

00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:56,959
tightness but at the spare time seven

00:01:54,709 --> 00:02:00,289
years ago I knew I was sold and this is

00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:02,170
what I'm gonna be writing in now so

00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:04,579
today I'm gonna share with you a lot of

00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:08,330
secrets I learned in seven years of

00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:10,729
building admin interfaces with Django so

00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:13,670
as I mentioned my name is Kola I work

00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:16,459
with awesome friends potato which is an

00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:20,000
agency based in London also San

00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:22,250
Francisco and Bristol and some who also

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,920
generously paid for my dream trip all

00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:27,200
across from the other side of the

00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,020
I come from Poland I also live in work

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,599
in London now I'm quite involved with

00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:35,209
tango so I had organized few Django

00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:37,580
cones in Europe and started jungle girls

00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:44,360
together with all our history here and I

00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:46,190
also named one of my cats Django so

00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,690
that's all my night shift and during the

00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:51,470
my day I work as a senior jungle

00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:53,180
developer and potato so but I mean today

00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,500
I want to talk about two things so first

00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,600
we're gonna start with the insights

00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,209
about me and learn a little bit how this

00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,069
even works and then you're gonna move on

00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:03,290
into the magic tricks and I will show

00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:06,170
you a little hey study of how we build

00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:09,100
django girls at me and what tricks we

00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:11,209
used to go from like this very usual

00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:14,030
Django admin you can see on the left

00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:17,810
which is actually an old t-shirt of the

00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:19,670
old django CSS do this new shiny and

00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:25,760
that we are using right now you can see

00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:27,920
on there so let me dive right into the

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,570
first part so that's the turrican

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,810
mysterious first of how jungle I mean

00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:34,220
actually works so jungle I mean existed

00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,650
since the very first incarnation of the

00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,840
Django framework and that's that's right

00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:41,870
into the chase the Django admin is one

00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,239
of the most mysterious and harder to

00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:47,380
figure out a parts of the Django

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:50,060
codebase mainly because of its quite

00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,980
incredibly good backwards compatibility

00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,560
so it hadn't changed for so many

00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,820
versions of jungle and it works despite

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,980
the fact that Rango changed so much in

00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,019
the last couple years

00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,549
if you ever village and grab probably

00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:03,709
imagine that jungle meanie is just

00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:05,750
nothing different than usual drunk

00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:08,359
applications so it probably has some

00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:11,000
URLs that belongs in the euro spy file

00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:13,790
and probably has views interviews by

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,169
file and maybe some models in the models

00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:19,850
file too well would be probably hard to

00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:21,739
be more wrong about that the current

00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,020
style first looks so much different from

00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:26,900
what you could imagine of how to add

00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,400
minis build first take a look the jungle

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,669
adding basically contains three main

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,050
classes each of them is at least 500

00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:35,580
lines long something like that

00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,470
disgusts our admin site which is

00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,650
basically the basic configuration class

00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:42,389
of your admin site you can have multiple

00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,400
um interface instances in your

00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:46,289
application and all you have to do is

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,780
just set up another instance of admin

00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:50,099
site class and include the world so for

00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,830
example if you'd like to have a

00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:54,150
different I mean for like completely

00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,949
different at me for some parts of the

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:59,520
Europe of users like students and a

00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:02,400
different admin for teachers that could

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,009
be accomplished with that then there is

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,990
a model admin class which is the class

00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:08,610
you're most familiar with because that's

00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:12,440
the classic extent every time you want

00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:15,599
to create a model admin for your model

00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,969
when the definition of this class will

00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:20,580
give you a picture of how big it is the

00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:23,219
model I mean in class encapsulate all

00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,289
albumen admin options and functionality

00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:27,360
for a given model this takes care of

00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:30,000
everything and it's almost 2,000 lines

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,379
of code and the further and last class

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,169
is change list which takes care of

00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:36,270
displaying and managing the view with

00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:39,710
the list of objects in the models if you

00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:41,909
click on some model you see this list of

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:44,639
objects appeared in that model you can

00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:47,310
search it filter it and things like that

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,830
so there is no URLs there is no views

00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,960
and it looks like nothing like you would

00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,419
expect so to fully understand how it

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,560
means works let's go through some code

00:05:54,419 --> 00:06:00,120
and see if we can find something

00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:02,370
interesting so yeah just like I said any

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,319
site object encapsulates an instance of

00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,240
the Django admin application and that's

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,969
ready to be hooked into your URL URL

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,159
come at the end of admin site traffic

00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:13,830
first definition you can see this one a

00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:16,139
little bit which is a line that defines

00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:18,569
admin site it's a default instance of

00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:21,300
the admin site would you use when you

00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:23,610
actually do this dude so you includes

00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,409
their admin in your URLs in your mind

00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:28,229
manuals usually have to just uncomment

00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:31,259
this line in Django so this is the class

00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:32,729
you actually use of course if you want

00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:34,830
you can also create an additional I mean

00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:37,169
just as I said just by creating another

00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:41,310
instance and plug it into your urls

00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:43,110
config file so if you won't have I'm

00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:45,490
inside you can just feel like this and

00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:48,610
included in the same URL spell

00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,120
so I already told you there is no URLs

00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,850
pile

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,740
so how does the actually work if you

00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,090
take a look into the stores you will see

00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,090
that the admin site class has the

00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:01,449
property called URLs which is basically

00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:03,900
executing that get urls method going

00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:07,060
deeper if you look at the get URL method

00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,849
you will see that actually like

00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,710
dynamically creates all of your URLs so

00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:14,800
they are not all written down but it

00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:19,720
kind of creates them as if those as the

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,610
function is executed so it creates like

00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,740
the ugly side white URLs like the

00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:29,110
directing so like the log in to log out

00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:31,330
password change and then but you already

00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:33,789
heard that there is also no view spy so

00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,889
all of these views that would normally

00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:39,009
be based in the view spy file are

00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:42,130
actually methods on the same class on

00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:45,130
the admin side class as you can I hope

00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:48,220
maybe the highlighting that I did is

00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:50,289
visible here and the second part of the

00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,930
URLs is created dynamically and consists

00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:54,729
of URLs to each of your registered model

00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:59,380
so you've got five models it's gonna

00:07:54,729 --> 00:08:03,460
look for this registry and create URLs

00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:04,810
for each of these models and so it looks

00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,639
freedom appends them to the euros

00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:11,169
pattern gets a playable model name and

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:15,009
includes the URLs for that model admin

00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:16,960
cost so which brings us to the next

00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:21,340
important part of what admin side does

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:23,080
and that's the model registry the model

00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:25,930
are registered with the admin side using

00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,060
the register madam so every time you did

00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:30,400
admin sites registered in your code

00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,900
which was usually in admin PI file you

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,779
actually use the admin site instance

00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,219
again so you talk about point seven you

00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:39,700
can also do it faster so you don't have

00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:41,680
to get faster without repeating the

00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,450
whole line and you can just repeating

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,110
actually their call out for admin class

00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:48,940
name but you can just use the crater and

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,940
that's cool take care of registering the

00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:53,290
model for you one thing I found out I

00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:57,089
found out when I was actually preparing

00:08:53,290 --> 00:09:00,630
this talk was that you can also if

00:08:57,089 --> 00:09:02,670
if you just want to use that the model

00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:04,230
admin class without overriding and after

00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,660
options you can just mention it like

00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:09,589
that so you can don't pass their outer

00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:11,850
admin name and don't create it and

00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:13,620
probably even more surprising thing is

00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,510
which I don't think is probably a good

00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,790
pattern but you can define the options

00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:19,470
in the registration so you can skip

00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,910
registering that creating the outer

00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,640
admin class but you can just register

00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:26,940
those options as parameters the register

00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,290
method and the last thing that can be

00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,360
interesting here is the ability to

00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,029
change some basic configuration things

00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,620
in the admin side so there is not many

00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:36,990
important bits except a couple of lines

00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,690
in the beginning of the file that can

00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:42,209
define how the admin is I was the

00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:45,240
halyard admin was the title it was

00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:46,860
displayed in the h1 tag on average and

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,360
guarding page or even the index page

00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:53,190
title displayed at the very top of the

00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:55,610
admin screen so that's admin side and

00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:59,730
now the model animal class which is

00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:02,640
monster in the closet and model I mean

00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:05,420
is almost 2000 of life that lives in

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,680
jungle countries admin options file and

00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,690
they didn't lie when they told you that

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,510
it actually does everything for any

00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:14,100
given model so now we kind of got one

00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:16,680
double dip here we've got the admin side

00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,899
which is the whole how admin and then we

00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:22,200
are only looking at admin for specific

00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:24,180
model so same as before you can notice

00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,790
that model I mean also have to get URLs

00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,339
method responsible for the routing and

00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,770
all of the URLs and it cuz it works the

00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:34,380
same way so it basically creates all of

00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:37,490
the URLs dynamically and it doesn't

00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:39,959
please every one of them separately so

00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:42,209
all everything you can imagine

00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:43,050
except maybe filters live on that model

00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:45,839
admin class

00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,670
oh you scholar responses URLs and

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,870
utilities are just a methods out on this

00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:53,550
admin custom however space make so it's

00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,980
quite a big class but it makes it quite

00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:57,570
easy to override things and as you will

00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,430
not this later in that talk will be

00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:02,670
actually exercising just opportunity

00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:04,050
very happily I'm not gonna go for the

00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,550
whole class here because we could

00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,740
probably sit here for another couple of

00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,520
hours it's very well documented so you

00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,530
can look

00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,450
everything on Jenga documentation I'm

00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:15,660
gonna tell you a little bit about my

00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:17,220
favorite things in this class and things

00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,630
that I discovered quite late and I was

00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:22,980
surprised that right

00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:24,630
so easy so first one is their actions on

00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,730
top and action on bottom these are the

00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:31,590
flags that you can set to true or false

00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:34,080
and this defines where the action bar

00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:36,840
sits so for example this action bar at

00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,570
the bottom here which this action you

00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,730
can then choose action bingo

00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:44,130
so you can define whether it's visible

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,480
on the bottom on the top or both which

00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,340
was quite a surprise for me because I

00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,320
often used to have like a long list and

00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,000
then you check all of these boxes then

00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,680
you go to the bottom and action action

00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,480
stop is not there because in default

00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,780
only on the top so you have to scroll

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,190
all the way up and select it so this way

00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:02,250
you can just kind of switch it on the

00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:04,830
quickly and and you don't move it and

00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,240
the other parts of skills it's there and

00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:09,510
I think they're act out some ways also

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,040
dealing with huge models and if you it

00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,600
can say for you and your clients a lot

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,360
of confusion if you spend the five

00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,100
minutes to structure and categorize it

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,140
properly or even hide some fields that

00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,280
are not visible for everyone and they

00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,590
shouldn't meet because it's dangerous

00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,650
to show something also people who are

00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:26,790
not familiar with the code base so

00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:29,820
thanks a couple of times pick a couple

00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:32,490
of it's probably sometimes hours or

00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:35,640
something some I'll set it up but it's

00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:37,260
quite useful to use it so here for

00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,110
example I grouped into three five fuel

00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:42,840
tips and I added also description to the

00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:46,770
second one so this way you can kind of

00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:48,090
highlight a field that should be kind of

00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:52,290
shot differently and provide more

00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:54,690
context or you can set the third filter

00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:56,460
as a collapse so these are like for

00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,900
example additional option options so

00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:01,140
only advanced users should have access

00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:03,120
to them there is also very neat option

00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,620
called these display links but allows

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,230
you to specify which fills in the

00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,730
objects people are clickable and will

00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:10,650
direct you to edit different in adding

00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,250
the default of that is just the first

00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,380
field

00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,750
Jennsen sometimes can be confusing if

00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,010
you play some version key in there and

00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,960
it's really useful to have a way to

00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:21,810
change that then so it looks like this

00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:24,360
so here you can also click that

00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:26,910
name which is brilliant or steena or

00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,600
Anna and you will also go to the edit

00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:32,220
page of that me and then a list at the

00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,410
table option is another real useful

00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,690
thing it allows you to specify which

00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:38,880
fields can be editable form and the

00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:41,880
change list view I usually use it for

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,740
things like checkboxes second you easily

00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,080
publish or an unpublished selected

00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,120
objects I thought this option can be a

00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,850
little bit dangerous and there is a

00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,510
bucket tracker issue open about six or

00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,600
seven years ago

00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:56,850
it's a suggest it's called number is one

00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,740
one three one three that suggests that

00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,960
the grantee not recommended to use in if

00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:04,380
you've got a lot of users using the same

00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:06,420
admin as one person can load the view

00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,339
then the other person allows the view

00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,080
yeah the second person change something

00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:11,400
the first person to change something and

00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,529
then they kind of overwrite their

00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:16,860
changes and it's just don't get messy

00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:19,980
and dangerous so this is how it looks

00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,779
like it basically allows you to edit at

00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:27,930
the position here in place before

00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:30,450
clicking on the edit button first and if

00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:32,610
you need a different default ordering in

00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:34,950
the admin and then in other places

00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,480
because you can also define ordering on

00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:40,260
that model I mean but you can also do

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,960
that here and that will allows you to

00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,820
just have a different default array the

00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:48,210
another needs and not very popular thing

00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:49,830
is right you feels I can you can specify

00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:51,690
all these stuff fields that are forging

00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:53,850
keys and they will show up as a radio

00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,800
buttons instead so that's quite useful

00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:57,510
if you've got only few options and you

00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,870
don't then you save your users a click

00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:03,770
to open the whole list of change of

00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:07,589
available options and only select page

00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:09,870
the last one I think is the one I only

00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:12,690
heard about like a year ago I was really

00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:15,870
surprised that it actually exists it's

00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:18,120
turned off in default but there is a

00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:20,700
save us and I thought that you can turn

00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,730
on and this will allows you to this will

00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:25,650
add you a new button save as news and

00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:28,200
when you are editing an object then you

00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:29,850
can change looping and move out and

00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,890
instead of like editing the same object

00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:33,060
you can save it as a new object so it's

00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:35,250
quite useful if you want to have like a

00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:38,400
base a base of one

00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:40,710
check and use a different one oh that's

00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,140
the last thing I have one word a show

00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:45,090
full result count so you know when you

00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:48,750
scroll down and to the bottom of the

00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:50,610
admin page you see their full pound of

00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:54,390
how many objects there is in this model

00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:55,950
this can be gonna get a lot of flow when

00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:58,440
you have lots of objects or when you are

00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:00,960
using and knowest well database so it's

00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:04,860
quite useful to have an ability to turn

00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:08,120
it off so as I heard monoamine class

00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:10,680
does have a lot of model specific things

00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,990
except this one so when you disappears

00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,610
when you enter this view when you enter

00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:16,830
them although adding and you see the

00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:21,570
list and you can feel their things this

00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:22,920
is actually handled by the Chinese so if

00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,150
you want to change the way your objects

00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,110
are displayed on this list this is

00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,180
probably a place to be

00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,340
however as you will see soon enough most

00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:32,190
of the things you ever want to or need

00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:33,870
to change our model admin class if you

00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:36,390
came to overriding a change list you're

00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:41,280
probably a couple of steps to get into

00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:42,900
this rabbit hole so yeah let's go

00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,810
straight into the magic tricks and I

00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:49,680
will now show you how to make admin even

00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:50,820
more awesome django girls have been so

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,470
we are going to use the jungle girls

00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,420
website is example and we've been to

00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:57,870
many places already we organized more

00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:59,430
than 170 events each of these events

00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:03,420
have their own website which is managed

00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:06,540
by one Django admin at Django girls at

00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:08,040
the park so we are going to take a look

00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:10,020
on the Django boots website it's a very

00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,329
kind of basic content management system

00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,829
we wrote from scratch in Django on the

00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:15,120
home page we've got a list of events and

00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:17,339
when you click on event you go to the

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,819
event page which is fully customizable

00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:22,050
from Django admin so this also allows us

00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,209
to publish websites in different

00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:26,670
languages I can't website from template

00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:29,520
paper you're hungry without implementing

00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:31,710
a whole translation system so each local

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,260
organizer of the event has access

00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:36,840
manager and can edit her own if I found

00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:39,330
event page without having access to all

00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,570
the other I did other event pages so

00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:43,100
that's quite important for us

00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,779
so first we modified to make sure that

00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,359
organizers only have permissions of

00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:50,840
things they need and nothing else is

00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:52,429
building more advanced permissions in

00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,019
this the most important thing was

00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:56,479
implementing a way to give organizers

00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:58,609
access to own events organized and no

00:17:56,479 --> 00:18:00,919
more so we needed a more gradual

00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:02,479
permissions system that allows us to

00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,059
give permission to one specific object

00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:07,700
not the whole model so here's how the

00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:09,769
admin looks for us and by us I mean that

00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,389
jungle girls maintenance team that

00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:13,039
helped organizers all over the world

00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:16,070
manage their own bride friendships so

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:19,099
we've got we see all of the events and I

00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:21,679
know there's no need for us to to hide

00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:24,679
any of them to make it look nicer and

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,989
add this nice helpful sidebar on the

00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:29,929
Left who is a package called Jango suit

00:18:26,989 --> 00:18:32,359
which gives you a really nice API - -

00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:35,059
your sidebars and kind of makes it easy

00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:37,609
to quick somewhere else that's an

00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:39,440
example I'm gonna use just eastern and

00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:43,070
Asia and Yahoo organized a tango goes

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,809
workshop in Cardiff and they they want

00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:47,509
to see the website in cardiff & cardiff

00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:49,309
only fortunately there is a nice and

00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:51,229
short way to do this i'm going to do is

00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:52,309
override a get course that method your

00:18:51,229 --> 00:18:55,399
model admin class

00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:58,909
so god even have been here and we define

00:18:55,399 --> 00:19:01,729
our cut for set so we get the old course

00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:04,009
at first and then if user is super user

00:19:01,729 --> 00:19:05,629
we return the whole thing but if not

00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:09,229
we're only filtering it by the team

00:19:05,629 --> 00:19:11,769
that's in this event very simple now

00:19:09,229 --> 00:19:14,450
it's an an onion only see your own event

00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:16,159
so this is enough and now let's see what

00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:18,409
happens if they modify the event object

00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:20,269
then they actually can see the whole

00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:23,450
thing again so they can override with

00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:26,119
the print event so we need to kind of go

00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:29,389
around this and make it and solve it for

00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:31,429
them so quick look into inside shows me

00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:33,379
that we can also have a method called

00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:35,210
get forum which does exactly what you

00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:37,399
think it gets a forum that is displayed

00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:40,159
on the screen so here we need to do the

00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:42,229
same feel thing override it again and if

00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,970
a user is not a super user

00:19:42,229 --> 00:19:46,570
we need to filter out the queries that

00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:51,080
fight the team and then we turn it and

00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:52,470
this way we've only got one one page

00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:56,760
available for

00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:58,169
and I am so the last thing we modified

00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,720
when it comes to specific permissions

00:19:58,169 --> 00:20:02,130
for organizers disabling an option to

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,990
edit a page after the event took place

00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,340
when organizers started towards

00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:06,960
organized second editions of their

00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,490
workshops they were going back and

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,530
changing the old pages instead of

00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,659
creating new ones so all right guys

00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:13,890
disappear then it was all messy so he

00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:16,110
wanted to forbid them from doing that

00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,090
and the condition shows that there is

00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:21,230
something called read-only field which

00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:24,090
we decided to use to make this happen so

00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:26,190
that was a little trickier and took me

00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:28,380
would have an hour to trying to hack

00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:30,690
into different places in the insides of

00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:33,390
the admin and I also learned that that

00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:36,929
it only feels it's pretty tightly

00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:40,890
coupled with other parts but I finally

00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:44,789
found a way to use the new meta stuff

00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:47,669
from Jack 128 so yeah if user was not a

00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:49,710
super user and if the event was in the

00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:53,900
past then you would set all of the

00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:56,460
fields as read-only and this way when

00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:58,200
any of us in the jungle maintenance team

00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,240
would enter this page they would still

00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,840
be able to edit it but organizers

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,419
couldn't so that's all you wanted and

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,340
this is quite a next favorite thing to

00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:09,870
do is kind of make my life easier

00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:12,240
spreading custom filters played on the

00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:14,309
changeless tables so for example we had

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,140
the need to contact all organizers from

00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:18,120
our organizing team I mean we didn't

00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,980
want to kind of go for everything and

00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,280
find their emails so we wanted to

00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:25,230
display them just next to the event name

00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:27,150
so we this is writing a simple method on

00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:30,659
event at me in class the text prints

00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:33,990
object and this place displays all of

00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:36,870
the emails so we can see that we defined

00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:39,870
the got organisers method here and also

00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:41,850
added to-do list display and then we

00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:44,100
list the whole army the whole team of

00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:46,890
the event with their names and emails

00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:50,039
and at the end we just returned it as a

00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:52,559
comma separated list and this is how it

00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:53,940
looks like in the admin so now next day

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,250
event 9 you can see all the organizers

00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:59,309
and just grab the emails and mail them

00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:01,110
that's easy now we also wanted to

00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:03,200
display the status of the event easily

00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:06,679
so you do the same but then you

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,019
that lean methods to true but we'll make

00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:12,860
them into this nice things instead of

00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:15,169
just displaying a word there is also way

00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:17,120
to display images in this way so you do

00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:20,870
the same thing and you're turning some

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:23,590
hot HTML and at the end you can see

00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:27,350
after yeah I use my friends face droid

00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:29,960
image I had on my off time but you can

00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:31,429
see all of the images despite here we

00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,450
kind of use it for sponsor logos or

00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:36,860
coaches photos so it's easy to grab and

00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:39,320
I think the last thing I thought here

00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:41,149
are custom actions so for example we

00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,429
need a way to quickly publish multiple

00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:48,110
events on the homepage with just one

00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:49,760
click so we've done this with here you

00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:51,380
can see an example of that and we've

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,230
done despite just creating another

00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:56,090
method on that event admin that says

00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:59,059
show on page and then updates everything

00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:01,519
to show it's on the home page true and

00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:06,110
at the end we also need to add it to the

00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:08,389
actions actions list and then it looks

00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:10,820
like that so it's quite easy I think I'm

00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:13,700
running out of time the last part of it

00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,139
but the one thing I wanted to mention is

00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,190
to make sure that it don't fall into the

00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:20,480
trap of customizing admin forever and

00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:23,330
it's not always possible to do

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,600
everything in it and you can kind of go

00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:29,210
into a rabbit hole of of just making the

00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,220
code so much hard to customize that it

00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:33,679
sometimes just worth it to create a new

00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:35,659
page so don't use the Django admin

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,279
interface as your user for using their

00:23:35,659 --> 00:23:38,590
things for your public users because

00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:40,730
that's probably a bad idea

00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:42,440
don't waste too much time trying to

00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:44,450
customize something if you see that

00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,490
there is probably a dead end it means

00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,320
that some some Django admin parts are

00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:50,360
not just that easy as custom to

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,620
customize those who like to so sometimes

00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,880
you see here to back off and write a

00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:57,260
custom view but to spend some time to

00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,730
make your managers and I'm use life

00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,429
easier with just a couple of small

00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:03,350
tricks and tweaks to your code and make

00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:05,029
sure your admins can break the website

00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:07,730
with too much power and giving them

00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:10,809
access to everything that usually

00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,809
doesn't lead to good things

00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:22,559
thank you so much

00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:25,410
Ola that was terrific so I have gotten

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,700
into that trap oh where we started a

00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:28,020
project and said oh we're just gonna use

00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,910
the admin it'll be fine

00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,920
you just need like one of the one of the

00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:35,250
change lists needs to kind of customize

00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:38,070
and then like two years later we've got

00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:39,420
so much admin customization yeah or

00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,799
maybe like a year into it we realized

00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,870
like we really should have just made it

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,990
made pass them stuff but we were like so

00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:48,540
far into it have you had like experience

00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:50,309
like at what point yeah you kind of

00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,900
decide okay and then when you got to

00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:53,160
that point did you go and rewrite

00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,660
everything or do you kind of keep some

00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:58,020
of it in the admin and then say for

00:24:54,660 --> 00:25:00,179
these for this workflow we have this

00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,200
custom yeah so I think the for me the

00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:03,780
breaking point is when you actually

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,179
spend much more time to customize

00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,590
something down the write subscribes so

00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,760
when you see this happening over and

00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:11,160
over again I think it's the time to

00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,200
rewrite it and I think I've only done

00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:17,549
this once to actually rewrite everything

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:20,220
from scratch maybe it's kind of probably

00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:21,960
good to kind of learn how that chunk I

00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,790
mean works inside and actually have our

00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,010
read through this class but now they're

00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:27,600
getting to know know this and then you

00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,130
have like an easier understanding of

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,679
where to go and where not to go

00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:33,419
before it actually happens I think

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,990
that's actually quite useful things to

00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:39,809
do but yeah the writing phase kind of

00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:41,760
depends on on your bad side requirements

00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:43,770
and product so it's hard to tell what

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,110
kind of and tell you what you should do

00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:47,520
it's your decision but it's worth

00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:56,669
getting to know I'm against see what's

00:25:47,520 --> 00:26:00,179
possible and what not so related to that

00:25:56,669 --> 00:26:03,320
last question when you decide that the

00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:05,580
admin is not adequate for a task you

00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,350
like literally go and write something

00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:10,290
from scratch because I had to do

00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:12,750
dashboards and stuff like that for for

00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:15,870
not admin users but login users that

00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:17,970
control some kind of content and we want

00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:21,390
to have them filters we want to have to

00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:23,610
give them search results and we want to

00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:25,050
generate forms automatically you know

00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,470
which is something that the animate

00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,169
makes

00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:30,360
very easy but then having to write a

00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:32,730
bunch of views just to get search

00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,770
queries working or drop down filters

00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:37,110
working it's kind of painful and you

00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:42,030
miss the admin in that case so I don't

00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:44,909
know if you have any recommendations now

00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:46,620
we are adding another custom completely

00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:48,870
custom views in the jungle at me so we

00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:52,200
kind of saw how people use it but we

00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:55,200
don't try to customize those existing

00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,179
views that Janko gives you but we are

00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:01,500
adding new use to it so for example

00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:02,370
there is I wrote by its officers up road

00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,400
by Frank wells

00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:07,620
it's called Django admin views which

00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,600
allows it quite easily add a view to

00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:11,309
like another completely new jungle view

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,309
to your admin and I think it's very

00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:17,010
useful to do that instead of trying to

00:27:13,309 --> 00:27:19,200
customize and extend existing views so

00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,820
we kind of the way we do this stuff for

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,820
example we need to I'm actually working

00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:26,760
on this friendly but we are kind of

00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:28,590
having some custom scenario when we are

00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,150
adding new organisers to events you want

00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:33,840
to do something a little bit more

00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:36,840
automatic foot so instead of going

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,640
around and hacking the creating user for

00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,860
we were just adding another view that

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,750
handles that and I think that's the best

00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,640
way because people can still keep using

00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:47,130
that opening and you've got all of the

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,990
benefits of that but you don't they

00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:50,990
basically don't have two places to go to

00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:57,240
all right one more question you should

00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:58,620
the example with get house way links I

00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,080
think it was home where you can have

00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:02,760
extra fields link to edit that model is

00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,919
it possible if you have a field that's a

00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:09,179
foreign key for a different model to

00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:11,520
link directly into the Edit view yeah no

00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:14,600
I think what do you have to do is figure

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:17,309
out the pattern of the world and then

00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:19,049
and what's the name of that pattern in

00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:22,110
the URL and then I think you can easily

00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:24,390
do that that's work so what i would do i

00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:27,720
was just create a new kind of feel so

00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:31,080
like get version key link or something

00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:33,019
and just hide the old field and just use

00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:39,779
this one as i as i knew

00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:42,590
it is like an HTML yeah thank you so

00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:42,590
