	Sign Me Up - Choosing & Using a Registration Package for Your Django Project by Eleanor Stribling

Registration steps to use a web app, as well as login and password reset functionality is a common requirement, but where do you begin implementing this in Django? Walking through an actual case study with code examples, novice programmers will learn some tips and tricks for finding and implementing the right framework.

come on

00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,779
so thanks for coming the talk is called

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,880
side me up as about choosing and using a

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:25,410
registration package on your Jenga

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,939
project so before we start I as as you

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,770
mentioned i come from products i was

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,989
like kind of setting the stage this is a

00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,820
novice level talk it's supposed to be

00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:34,320
pretty simple and straightforward if

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,880
you've built a nap in this tutorial once

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,950
you should be fine in this talk you'll

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,290
be totally ok you can go some Python

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,910
you'll be totally ok but I think this

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,679
might also be useful for people who are

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,989
teaching or who are mentoring younger

00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,420
developers who haven't done this before

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,980
so hopefully this will at least give you

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,679
some ideas about how to talk to them

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,170
about django and how especially the file

00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:58,710
structure works this talk will use

00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:02,429
python 3 jangle 1.9 and the package i

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,329
chose django registration redux 1.4 so i

00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,710
just want to be upfront with that

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,480
because not all these things work with

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,790
all versions of other things so just to

00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,710
be clear and I'm going to cover the

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,270
implementations of registration flow so

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,310
basically that how the package takes the

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,110
user model builds on that and enables

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,909
you to set something up with just a few

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,340
templates in a few alterations so that

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,710
you can do these are authentications so

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,229
they put in any password the user is

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,060
created but they they get an email which

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:29,040
say you click on a link then they are

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,479
authorized and their account is active

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,439
so that that's what I'm covering today

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,509
I'm not going to cover any of the email

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,000
setup or site deployment so actually

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:41,219
sending the email different topic not

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,390
going to go over it so just to be

00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:44,009
upfront with that but i will show you

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,009
how to test the emails on your on your

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:49,619
local machine so the origin story of

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,060
this talk was i am not a full-time

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:53,820
developer but I work in a sense person

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,170
company so I kind of do whatever but

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,450
this is all started with the personal

00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,130
project this django app called belize

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,049
and basically it's a nap it's in my

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,210
github repo you can look at it if you

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:04,890
want to it does definitely illustrate

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,530
some things not to do when implementing

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,570
django registration rita still a diesel

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,340
refactoring but it's a cautionary tale

00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,870
it does work though and it is on the web

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,720
at police calm if you want to see what

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:18,180
the end result was so i wanted to add

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,550
this as a Jenga novice and the reason i

00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,210
wanted to give this talk was that i

00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,490
found it

00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,350
really difficult to do and after doing

00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,570
it I was like why was that so difficult

00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:30,180
it's actually pretty straightforward so

00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,670
that's what I wanted to do the top three

00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,470
things I wanted to cover criteria and

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,710
resources for choosing a registration

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:39,000
package there are actually quite a few

00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:41,250
so things to think about as you're doing

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,010
it again as a product person this is

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,600
always very important to me how the

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,430
pieces of the package fit into the

00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,020
Django framework this for me was the

00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,030
hardest part as somebody who had not

00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,100
used Jenga before when you start with

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,480
this when they aren't you remember this

00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,040
but when it's early when I started with

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,810
it it just seemed like a bunch of files

00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,580
and a bunch of folders doing a bunch of

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,050
things and I was just like okay i'll

00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:04,470
just type this here and i'll type this

00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:06,450
there and it would somehow work so i

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,790
wanted to show sort of the tutorial i

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:11,310
wanted of walking through like what

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,740
you're changing and what it's doing so

00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,420
that's the other objective and then a

00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,070
couple of kind of gotchas that i ran

00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,190
into trouble with and took me an

00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,810
ordinance I'm to figure out there in the

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:23,040
documentation but they're kind of hidden

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,050
and I feel like they're things that

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,820
other people we're trying to help me

00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,380
couldn't figure out right away so I

00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,760
thought they might be common problems

00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,470
that people have even though it's

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,350
somewhere on the internet someone's

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,700
explained it I should also mention my

00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:38,070
son's kind of a theme through this whole

00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,330
thing for some levity I would put

00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:42,420
puppies but I didn't have the rights to

00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:45,390
images of puppies so it's my kid so

00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:47,700
choosing a registration package so set

00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,870
in the criteria again matching product

00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,960
requirements you probably know I was

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,430
going to say that I think a good friend

00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,100
looking from sort of the business side

00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,810
but also work at my own projects I would

00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,600
say definitely look at your immediate

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,520
requirements but maybe one level above

00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,260
this particular package doesn't support

00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,360
certain things that I think eventually I

00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:10,080
will want to add so will be regret there

00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,340
on my part do as I say not as I do but

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,050
that's that's a really important

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,460
criterion and to know what those

00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,260
requirements are because you could get

00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:19,680
really you know down a rabbit hole on

00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,480
this stuff compatibility so Jacob

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,900
registration Redux for example does not

00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:27,120
work with Django after 1.8 so that might

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,580
be trivial for you to upgrade but in my

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,060
experience upgrading is not necessarily

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,660
trivial so just keep that in mind

00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,920
maintenance and usage

00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,630
so this to me is a really big one

00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,400
especially when you're you're starting

00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,900
or you know you don't want any bleeding

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,810
edge you just want something that works

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,190
and you can get done one thing I was

00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,810
really looking for is something that is

00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,390
maintained well you know so I checked

00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,620
commits on github I checked how many

00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,350
people were using it how many people

00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,000
worked it as a proxy so I just wanted to

00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,770
get a feel for it like how have

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,450
frequently is used I can also find a

00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,130
bunch of tutorials online which brings

00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,960
me to my fourth point which is the

00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:03,260
quality of documentation I feel like

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,760
documentation is very much ever looked

00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,960
when working in software it causes so

00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,140
many problems when they're not good

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,490
examples out there so I also picked a

00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,080
package where there was a lot of

00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,700
documentation there were good YouTube

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,350
videos and I think also helps when

00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,090
you're teaching somebody who's new to

00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,350
this to be able to show them lots of

00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,510
different ways of explaining something

00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:24,540
so those are present I think that's

00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:26,430
that's a good time I wanted to introduce

00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,320
Django packages calm if you don't

00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:31,200
already know about it the site is i love

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,760
the site so much it's not like a listing

00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,280
basically every package you could want

00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,020
and it lays out some some

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,640
characteristics of each package if

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,400
things like does it support OAuth does

00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:44,700
it work with Jago 1.5 or later with

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,890
Python 3 etc so I think it's a really

00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,870
great resource and you can prove it at

00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,370
your leisure it also has links to the

00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,380
repose which again I think are really

00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,880
useful for getting a feel of how how

00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:58,650
frequently the code is maintained how

00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:00,900
many people are using it so this is kind

00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,940
of the big one for me was fitting listen

00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,700
to the framework is honestly I had no

00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:07,140
clue that I was doing at first and i

00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:10,500
didn't like i said didn't find anything

00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:12,600
very clear so um hidden pictures my son

00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,690
i decided to make because my other app

00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,910
was like such an intense expression of

00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:20,250
how confused i was when i first did this

00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:22,380
i decided to make a really simple a

00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,669
little kind of baby app for this so it's

00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,400
called fairy tale reviews because my son

00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:28,590
loves fairy tales super simple data

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,900
model you just leave a review of a fairy

00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:34,650
tale you can sign in or sign up so

00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:36,150
that's the registration piece there we

00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,520
go my doing it was slow can i record

00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,870
this video I don't like coding you know

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,690
even my videos sometimes

00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:44,370
are weird so you can sign in with that

00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,420
you can login at the login form so

00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,980
that's basically what gen your

00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,440
registration me that's does that and

00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:52,920
registering the user so once you login

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,350
you can see a form I talk faster than my

00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,960
video you can see a forum where you can

00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:01,230
actually write a review up at the top so

00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,210
you click on write overview or you can

00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:05,220
sign a piss and you click right of you

00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:07,110
and there's the form so that's basically

00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,910
what it is and then you do the review

00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,040
and it shows up on the next page so it's

00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,810
a very very simple little app but any

00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,280
sort of i think beginner Django user

00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,700
could could figure out what's going on

00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,380
in this and it does work with the sequel

00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,360
I'd database there's none of the

00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,200
postgres hassle and there we go of my

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,270
review of twelve dancing princesses

00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,790
which is a great fairy tale check it out

00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:30,150
if you have not if you've not already so

00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:31,740
this is the the file structure part so

00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,940
I've left to add to the dungaree nets in

00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,650
the migration files and when i worked

00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,240
with you know high level this is these

00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:40,200
are the files that you've got you've got

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,390
to manage py you've got your database

00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,860
you've got your project in this case in

00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:46,050
the repo it's called Jango calmness

00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,390
lights and brackets parentheses Rather's

00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:51,150
jeguk on and it gives you these files

00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:52,980
and then there's the app folder which

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,870
you create and these are the default

00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:57,000
files so i wanted to talk a little bit

00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,410
about what you need to add because this

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,050
really screws me up with someone who's

00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:03,840
first learning django you have to

00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:05,220
obviously add a forms file and in this

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,050
app you have done that anyway for the

00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,560
review writing we need to add it in

00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:13,980
order to create your user and you have a

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,290
templates folder where you have

00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:18,840
hopefully a base HTML file your next end

00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:21,810
with your templates you have your folder

00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:24,270
of templates for your app so those are

00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:25,980
the all of the ones i'm going to show

00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,630
you all right i'll do the two that i

00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,370
showed you already the form and then the

00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:31,650
page that followed the reviews on it and

00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:33,090
then finally a folder called

00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:35,970
registrations that's been hold all your

00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:37,710
registration templates this is one thing

00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:39,900
i wish i had at the beginning because i

00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:43,050
didn't know that you only had to alter a

00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:47,310
couple of these files and folders and

00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:49,590
those are the ones so the first step 5

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:51,990
steps doing this if installed jenga

00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,670
registration redux easy right also

00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,880
update

00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:59,000
it's unreal stickler for that and then

00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:02,000
you create a form and user with the user

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,110
model inform step py so you need to

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
determine which fields you need this

00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,590
goes back to requirements username and

00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,820
password are required and that's pretty

00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:10,160
clear in the documentation which is

00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:12,610
pretty good around this other field two

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,870
built-in it's like first and last name

00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,760
so you could add those if you wanted to

00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,170
you don't have to and of course you can

00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,970
also extend the user model but I'm not

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:21,650
going to cover that here so this is

00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,900
basically all you have to do it's just a

00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,610
few lines you want to import the user

00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,770
model and then you create this user

00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,990
forum and the fields are the three that

00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:32,930
I wanted my form that's all you have to

00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:34,760
do they're pretty straightforward you

00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:38,360
have to install the registration a pin

00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:40,610
setting and stop py so here it is this

00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,260
is how the first tutorial i found told

00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,870
me to do it and I highlighting here

00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,250
because it layered cause me problems so

00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:49,430
anyway you add that you have to make

00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:51,800
sure Jengo contribute sites is there and

00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:53,450
then you should be good the other thing

00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,130
I wanted to mention i'm not going to

00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:56,780
talk about it a lot but they're a bunch

00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,240
of variables so you can set to control

00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:01,340
the user experience using jenga

00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,020
registration redux these are actually

00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,720
pretty well explained in the docs and I

00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,860
put some the ones I use here so if you

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,580
want to check out the repo they're all

00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:12,230
their next getting the registration

00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,120
templates so when you think about it

00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:15,770
there's a ton of different views you'll

00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,720
see when you go to registration or

00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:20,090
resetting your password or being

00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,890
authorized or whatever I started writing

00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:24,500
all these myself and I discovered a nice

00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:26,960
person has done it for us so you can

00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,610
clone this repo these are all the

00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,430
foreign there's a lot of different HTML

00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,080
files in here so you can just clone this

00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,450
and then customize it yourself and it's

00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,130
so much easier than then trying to write

00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:40,960
them all yourself and you can spend time

00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:45,260
having fun with CSS and such and then

00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:47,090
you add to your URLs py not the one in

00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,530
your app so this really confused me I

00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:50,960
thought it had to be in the app it is

00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:53,330
not in fact in the app if you look at

00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,190
the other thing I made in my repo it's

00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,300
really embarrassing I've got like why

00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:58,220
the lines one

00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,110
of of trying to import every single one

00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,360
of these views like every single pattern

00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:06,230
rather you don't have to do that you

00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,480
just have this one line in URLs fpy and

00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:11,570
that's it that's all you have to do I

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,660
said a lot of time doing that and I

00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:17,150
didn't have to but there are two

00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,800
problems that really two issues that

00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,390
really caused me trouble took a ton of

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,970
time to figure out and I wanted to

00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:25,970
mention those just in case it saves you

00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:28,100
time so the first problem I had and this

00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:31,580
was honestly the most irritating thing

00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:33,620
ever was I couldn't get the custom

00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:36,080
templates to work so I download the repo

00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:37,910
I spent all this time on the CSS and all

00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,230
this stuff in the HTML I put in

00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:41,630
bootstrap I did all kinds of amazing

00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:44,000
things and then I I actually tried to

00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,920
use it and it didn't work so there I had

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,960
the example of typing this as a template

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,760
to see if it was my custom template and

00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,340
then when I actually went to it on my

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,400
localhost I got this for the password

00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:57,680
reset which is painful and sad it looks

00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:00,830
nice but it's not what I wanted so how

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,750
to fix this well the import order

00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:05,630
installed apps and settings stop py was

00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:08,290
my problem I did not realize this for

00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:10,850
quite some time it was again extremely

00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:13,340
upsetting but anyway I had the problem

00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:16,460
was I didn't put the registration app

00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:19,040
before contribut that was the problem

00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,660
because contributed then it will go

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,660
through that first if its first in the

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:26,240
list so that was very unfortunate and

00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,830
took forever but now you know so you

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,690
have to worry about that also the way I

00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,510
organized this I should mention if you

00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:34,910
were doing a bigger project you might

00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:36,920
not want to put all the registration

00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:39,590
templates in one app but in this case I

00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:43,610
did so I had to import my app before the

00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:47,050
right decision so then it works so that

00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,050
was you know a couple days in my life

00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:52,520
the next problem I had was testing

00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:54,800
emails in dev so I wanted to set it up

00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,390
you know I wanted to to put it out put

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,890
it out there on the internet I wanted to

00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,780
use the record to deploy it i knew i

00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:02,090
could use sendgrid plugin and I think

00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,410
that College of all that was fine but

00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,760
the problem was I wanted to test this

00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,410
and Devon make sure it kind of at least

00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,150
sort of work first before I went through

00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:12,020
all that trouble so

00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:15,900
to do that what what I started with was

00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:18,600
the video going here so i started i use

00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:20,970
my form and filled in all of these these

00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,950
fields the thing about submitting this

00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:25,800
form i'll say as this is going is it

00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:27,390
does actually create a user even if you

00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,890
get the air i'm about to get it just

00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,570
doesn't make them active and it doesn't

00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,010
send an email because it's not set up to

00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,410
send an email you're telling Jago send

00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:38,460
an email and it can't so you get this

00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:40,230
error the connection refused error I've

00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:43,200
seen this so many times brings back

00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:46,050
memories the way to solve this is

00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,820
actually very simple but it does involve

00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,320
adding another line of code in another

00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,970
file which again is what I think is

00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,910
really hard about Django when you don't

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:55,380
know it because it's just like so many

00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,870
different things you need to add in all

00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:00,090
these different places in retrospect

00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,580
pretty straightforward but that's how it

00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:06,600
is in your learning so you need to go in

00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:08,940
your settings py and you need to add one

00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:12,150
line of code with a variable called

00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,590
email back end and this is important

00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,780
both for actually sending emails and

00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:17,730
projected console this case is console

00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,980
in there which is important for the

00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:22,680
printing to the console part if you do

00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,510
actually implement like an email server

00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,860
if you do like to put Roku you sink

00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,840
right and all that stuff you do have to

00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:30,360
change the conscious console to smtp

00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,160
which i learned only after harassing

00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,580
sendgrid for a full day about why their

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,500
stuff didn't work so then that works you

00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:40,350
get that template and then it will print

00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,990
it all out in your console the way i did

00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,490
it i set the site ID to localhost and in

00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,830
the repo their instructions for that I

00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:49,320
didn't want to cover that here but I

00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:53,190
just got set it to localhost colon 8080

00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:55,770
Royce i guess and and then it works so

00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:57,420
this will just demonstrate it this again

00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:00,450
why I don't like code because the videos

00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:02,310
breathing hard all right and then yeah

00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:04,170
and now the account is activated so

00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:06,240
that's a great way to test it before you

00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,950
you push it out and if you have problems

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,160
at that point obviously you can you can

00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:14,300
see them before you put a production so

00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:16,740
a bunch of resources for this talk

00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:19,649
definitely if you want to check out my

00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:22,379
the repos on github this last one I did

00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:24,089
the very tail one is very simple it's

00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,470
not complex at all i think it's pretty

00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,869
straightforward for explaining it and

00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:29,939
the code is commented if you want to

00:15:27,869 --> 00:15:31,559
show someone what not to do or if you

00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:33,329
want to compare your your app to

00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:34,350
somebody else who didn't know what they

00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:36,600
were doing and see if there any

00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:39,420
similarities i highly recommend checking

00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,279
out the other repo i have it does work

00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,990
that it does have a lot of extra code so

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,699
it does show where the confusions points

00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:46,679
were would say importing a bunch of URLs

00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:48,480
excuse me adding a bunch of URL patterns

00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:52,019
that i really don't need and stuff like

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,209
that I used Jenga 1.9 and Django reef

00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:56,759
registration redirects 1.4 once again

00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:59,100
you do need to use Jenga 1.8 or higher

00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:01,079
with one point force that's something to

00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:04,529
keep in mind if this is something you

00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:08,100
want to use or teach so that's about it

00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:18,420
this is me thank you so much for listen

00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:21,089
and a few any questions happy here thank

00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:28,050
you so much Eleanor looks like we've got

00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:29,850
a question up here hey thank you for the

00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,529
talk I was actually struggling with

00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:34,079
these registration like just last week

00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:37,110
and I had to deal with registration

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:40,170
redux and then um I was curious if you

00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:43,139
also looked into Django all off cuz like

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:44,610
I found that one slightly less confusing

00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:47,339
but I don't know like if there was any

00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:50,339
real difference other than that one also

00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:52,800
like supports like social sites like

00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:54,360
logins yeah that's actually why I didn't

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,160
use it because I thought that would add

00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,079
a layer of complexity and I didn't

00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,730
really need that so I thought out forget

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,589
it i'll just go with registration redux

00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,589
maybe i should have gone fall off

00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:18,439
fall off like oh yeah packages calm for

00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:20,750
somebody's super noona Django the is the

00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:22,880
registration redux actually making a

00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,069
user itself or is it using I'm assuming

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,689
it's using the gen goes user ok just I

00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:28,910
can turn yeah that's what you're doing

00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:30,500
that form step is you're you're you're

00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,820
importing a user and then you're making

00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,400
the form with those fields that you want

00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,990
so yeah it's totally leveraging that and

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,840
like I said when you first when they

00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:41,120
first sign up it creates it it creates

00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,190
that user in the database and it just

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,110
doesn't activate it so that the whole

00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:48,730
like link clicking is activating the

00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,730
user thank you

00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,110
