come on

00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:19,830
my name is Andrew Sauber I'm sure that

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,720
if we all woke up tomorrow and our bank

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,090
account was at a zero balance we'd be

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,410
surprised to say the least if you use

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,810
online banking this is a very real

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,610
possibility banks retailers and

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,350
healthcare use the same cookie back

00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,840
sessions that are web applications use

00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,970
to authenticate user requests today I'd

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,080
like to present session armor a protocol

00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,940
that I'm developing as part of my

00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,890
graduate studies that aims to protect

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,739
against session hijacking and provide

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,610
robust replay prevention so first let's

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:46,560
review the vulnerabilities of

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,420
cookie-based sessions one thing to note

00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,890
is that sessions are bearer tokens which

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,930
means they're static for the duration of

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,360
a session and they bear the burden of

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,890
authenticating all requests there's a

00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,140
number of opportunities to steal this

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,329
token first if the client connection

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,680
isn't encrypted when during

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,649
authentication then all bets are off

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,140
this is why our login endpoints at least

00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:08,670
use HTTPS if there's a cross-site

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,920
scripting vulnerability on our site and

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,080
we haven't set the HTTP only flag then

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,789
any injected JavaScript or third-party

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,670
JavaScript library could ship off

00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:19,200
session cookies to an attacker and also

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,080
packet sniffing during a session if

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,820
traffic is unencrypted also provides an

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,790
opportunity for the session token to be

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,229
stolen this is called side jacking and

00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:31,350
lastly something that I haven't seen

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,939
really mentioned before is rogue browser

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,520
extensions so you download a screenshot

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,400
browser extension it could be in the

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,840
background if it's given permission

00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,720
shipping all of your session tokens off

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,250
to an attacker so I was curious as to

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,689
how many sites actually use these

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,630
protections so I developed a browser

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:51,030
extension called session jack that

00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:53,340
deactivates a cookie the cookies for

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,630
each day for a given domain one at a

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,640
time based on the protections that are

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,860
being used and if I was still logged in

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,259
it meant that the protection wasn't

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,869
being used and what I found was that

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,070
about thirty percent of sites their

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:07,140
session tokens are potentially

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,149
vulnerable to cross-site scripting fifty

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,320
percent of sites their session tokens

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,720
are potentially vulnerable to side

00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,410
jekking and ninety-nine percent of sites

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,110
use cookies for their session tokens I

00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:20,609
think that we can do better than cookies

00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:23,639
this is why I'm developing the session

00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:24,900
normal armor protocol the specification

00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:26,760
is still in flux

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,760
so I'm not going to go through it in

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,920
complete detail first of all the server

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,750
creates an opaque token which includes

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,549
the real session ID so this is a layer

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,829
on top of our existing session tokens

00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:42,329
it's symmetrically encrypted and sent to

00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:43,560
the client including an HTML key that

00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:45,750
the client uses to authenticate

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,370
subsequent requests H Mac is a way to

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,709
prove ownership of a key without

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,129
revealing the key itself and can also

00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:55,109
assume associated data in the process

00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:57,569
your clients will use H Mac to

00:02:55,109 --> 00:03:00,900
authenticate their requests to the

00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:03,239
server once you have an H Mac you can

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,400
implement two types of replay prevention

00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,560
if there's a time stamp in the H Mac

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,920
when the server verifies the H Mac it

00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,319
can reject stale requests so this is

00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,730
time-based replay prevention you can

00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:19,500
also have counter based replay

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:21,269
prevention which incurs some additional

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,269
server side storage because the server

00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:26,730
has to maintain the current count in an

00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:29,790
end I'd recommend in a bit vector so

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:31,980
that you can have some out of order you

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,260
can you won't reject requests even if

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,209
they're out of order and this is

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:39,540
absolute replay prevention but requires

00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:41,250
you to have an additional cash of

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,209
basically the counter that each of your

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,129
clients are using I'd recommend

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:47,849
something like Redis or whatever

00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:49,799
underlies here Django cash in order to

00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:53,819
implement that so some of you may know

00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:55,440
that hmh is nothing new having this kind

00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:57,150
of opaque token is nothing new but I

00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,069
believe that my protocol has a few

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,810
advantages first of all there's a setup

00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:02,819
phase to choose the H Mac algorithm in

00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:06,299
case there's a vulnerability found for

00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:11,669
example sha-1 is not allowed it's only

00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:13,229
shot 256 and above you can configure the

00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:15,479
headers that are authenticated like for

00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:18,539
example if you have some cache control

00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:20,370
headers that the server your your

00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:22,919
intermediate proxy might not be able to

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,710
might not have the HM a key in order to

00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,289
authenticate to your back-end there's

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,610
optional custom header authentication

00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:32,370
counter based replay prevention is

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,659
optional and it leverages an existing

00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,520
session infrastructure rather than

00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:37,260
replaces it so it's a layer on top of

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,639
your existence existing session tokens

00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,740
once the server

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,990
authenticate the request it decrypts the

00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:46,169
opaque token and then just passes your

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,430
session cookie down to django so you

00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:50,249
don't have to modify your application

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,960
code if you're using this I have a very

00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:53,789
early proof of concept implementation as

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,560
a django middleware and as a google

00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:57,689
chrome extension up on my github if you

00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,729
click repositories and you can reach me

00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:07,169
on twitter i accept dm's at WK 3 a-s

00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:08,849
thank you I'm new to this sorry my name

00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:10,409
is Justin Crassus I'm the director of

00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:12,419
technology at narrative content group

00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:13,889
with the tech department of narrative

00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:20,490
content group please stand up where are

00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:22,680
you it's two people we have a family of

00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,139
content sites such as imminent calm

00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:28,229
mother nature news network something

00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:30,389
like that and we have treehugger.com as

00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:36,589
well hopefully nobody at my job will see

00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:39,930
this video but anyway we in front of our

00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:44,339
content Django based content servers we

00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:45,990
we run PageSpeed over engine X which is

00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:48,000
fun and so you have to upgrade it and

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:51,539
then it's terrible because you have to

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,270
compile it we have about 20 servers give

00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:56,399
or take across all the sites and

00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:58,800
recently there was a security update for

00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,430
PageSpeed he was back in February at

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,199
least that's when I caught wind of it I

00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:06,719
was not going to log into 20 servers I'm

00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:10,649
Way too lazy for that we use ansible

00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:13,349
heavily to deploy our application so we

00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:15,029
wrote an ansible module for it that is

00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:17,580
the read meet for it which is probably

00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:18,810
the best documentation for it now the

00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,129
actual role is only about a hundred

00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,080
lines of code how many people use

00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:24,300
ansible I might be talking to ansible

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,210
and do those some people also use page

00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,680
feed all right so nobody's going to use

00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,479
this role that's fantastic but maybe

00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,050
somebody watching the video this will

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,759
help one person I saw so anyway the

00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,599
problem with the engine X PageSpeed if

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,719
your underwear is that you have to

00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:42,599
compile it which is yeah hopefully in

00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:45,539
the future they'll have dynamic modules

00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:48,209
like Apache does so anyway we're able to

00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:49,620
so the agent X role does some cool stuff

00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:50,879
if you're interested in ansible at all

00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,990
there's some cool features with this

00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,600
role which is

00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,280
we have about 25 rolls I chose this one

00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,160
to talk about not the Django one which

00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,900
is a complete mess this one has some

00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:06,210
cool features which I'm going to try to

00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:07,740
review so again when you're compiling in

00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:11,460
genetics you have to give it a bunch of

00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:13,500
build options which you can specify with

00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:16,620
this animal dictionary that the cursor

00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,810
is kind of near right now these are all

00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,540
configurable you can extend it you can

00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:24,420
change it to whatever you need to do and

00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:27,300
you'll be able to install engine X just

00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:29,160
by specifying the version you want and

00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,260
the engine text version so it'll compile

00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,670
in genetics and the PageSpeed module and

00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:36,300
this other thing called piece all which

00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:37,800
you need to get page beat the work what

00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,720
it does is actually going to build out

00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,120
using the version numbers it's going to

00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,350
look to see if you have it already

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,080
downloaded and then if you have it

00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:47,190
downloaded it will try to install it so

00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,900
with ansible roles i'm not sure if

00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:51,090
you'll know item potency is a very

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,440
important thing if you run a role twice

00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,790
it shouldn't really do anything the

00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,950
second time everything's already

00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:58,110
configured it shouldn't be redownloading

00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:00,510
it should be resetting configuration

00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,980
files or restarting servers if it hasn't

00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:05,760
actually done anything this role

00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:07,740
thankfully is idempotent so we have a

00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:14,190
lot of checks and stuff i'm going to try

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:16,440
to navigate task file name hopefully

00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:20,130
it'll just yes so this is actual ansible

00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,420
roll itself you can tell it's I don't

00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:23,730
know this could look Greek to people

00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,620
that don't you I'm actually Greek so

00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:28,590
that's a little bit better this could

00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:31,320
look a little weird to people that but

00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:33,180
anyway it's basically the each I guess a

00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:36,540
little tick mark on the left indicates a

00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,860
step in the in the build process so you

00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:42,450
can see me download in genetics me

00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:45,180
unpack it we can figure it we do source

00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:46,950
stuff we set variables and then we

00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,690
finally create the directory that you

00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:50,870
can actually put your engine X site

00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:53,100
configuration and so that's really cool

00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:55,770
one cool feature that I'm going to do

00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,230
before I get out of here is what's known

00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:00,510
as the custom jinja filter plugin so

00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:04,020
ansible uses jinja for as its templating

00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:05,699
engine I wrote a custom filter that

00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,839
turns those build that build

00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:09,149
dictionary that I pointed out to you

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,169
before the build options dictionary into

00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:14,730
the actual command line that the

00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:16,199
compilation step is going to take so

00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:22,829
that's how we make it extensible and

00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:26,069
easy to use and I'm done that's it this

00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:28,499
is about anti-social authentication so

00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:30,299
I'm Dan Davis I'm from the National

00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:32,910
Library of Medicine there are a number

00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:36,209
of us here and we're switching from

00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:46,850
Django to django from a number of other

00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:46,850
languages especially cold fusion so oops

00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:59,050
what's the problem I want to tell you

00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:01,780
how we integrate Django with NIH log in

00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:03,730
our corporate identity provider most of

00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,890
the auth tutorials we see online are

00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:08,170
about user registration on the web but

00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:10,660
most of the apps we implement only allow

00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,250
logins for corporate users even if

00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:15,580
they're public side is available on the

00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:19,630
web now so we want to implement single

00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:21,430
sign on with this badge and we want to

00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:24,310
do it in it with common code that can be

00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:27,880
used by multiple internal apps so why is

00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:30,010
this hard I mean we may think that you

00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,020
know we can use well remote user

00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:34,660
middleware with some sort of Apache

00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:38,500
module we may think that oh we'll just

00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:40,660
use the ldap authentication well we're

00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,010
supposed to use NIH login because you

00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,490
know we don't want our applications

00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:49,240
handling passwords even if they are SSL

00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:50,440
and NIH login is antisocial off not only

00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,510
in the sense that we don't want to

00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,600
authenticate Google even though it does

00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:57,970
technically support that but because

00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,400
it's based on CI CA siteminder which

00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:02,740
means it is also based on sam'l that

00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,480
would mean every application needs a

00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,360
certificate and key tied to that

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:11,350
application getting this certificate and

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:14,650
key can take like a month for totally

00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:16,300
non technical reasons finally we also

00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,800
want to see the same auth in our

00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,960
development environment so that our

00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:23,710
selenium integration tests can handle

00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:26,380
pages that require authentication so our

00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:29,350
systems guys will want us to do this by

00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:31,540
installing CA siteminder and that makes

00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:34,270
controlling particular paths outside of

00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:37,870
/ admin something we have to do by

00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:40,810
committee and our application may have

00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:43,420
rest paths and me we may want only to

00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:47,650
protect updates to our rest ablett

00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:49,780
endpoints fortunately our tooling team

00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:52,930
has already implemented a cast server

00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:56,320
and they protect the log in on that

00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:58,630
server with CA siteminder causing casts

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,150
to be what we need to integrate to and

00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:03,720
cass is friendly to developers you don't

00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:05,950
need a certificate for each aab it

00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,030
authenticates the Earl it's not quite as

00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,190
secure though

00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:14,730
it's really authenticating just the Earl

00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:20,680
but that does mean that localhost 8080

00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:23,140
local host is ok so our system guys are

00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,570
used to this and they would still like

00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:30,700
us to use it Apache module this time mod

00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:32,410
off gas we don't want to go this way we

00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,720
still want to customize what urls are

00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:36,340
protected ourselves and we still want to

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,340
see the same thing in the development

00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:42,190
environment as in production so we found

00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:45,130
that Django Cass ng the ng stands for

00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,840
next-generation supports all this it can

00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:49,330
integrate with the central

00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,940
authentication service it supports

00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:55,060
protecting an earl range such as / admin

00:12:51,940 --> 00:13:04,120
through settings it supports decorators

00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:07,870
such as login required and we've also

00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:10,690
enhanced Django casts ng bite adds an

00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:13,360
extra security we want some functions to

00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:14,980
work only within our some subnet we want

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,320
to deploy your app so that the admin

00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:20,910
side and the public side can be deployed

00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:23,680
together on the same application servers

00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:25,660
this is not what we've done with cold

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:30,070
fusion and there was some pushback on

00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:31,570
this but we want to make sure that admin

00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:34,240
users are only coming from our own

00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:37,180
subnet so that includes a decorator a

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,120
middleware and a context processor and

00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:44,140
the context processor help helps us to

00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:47,050
have our admin navigation in in our web

00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:50,940
apps so we can show that link only to

00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,940
users who should be allowed to use it

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,230
thank you I'm going to hang out up there

00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:02,010
on floor G if there are any questions

00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:02,010
thanks thank you

00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:08,490
I want to talk to you about Jago girls

00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:13,440
and in particular something that we do

00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:17,190
every week we publish a story from a

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:21,209
woman who uses python and django so if

00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:24,930
you are a woman who uses Python and or

00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:27,690
Django at well you know what I mean or

00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:30,740
if you know a woman who does that so I'm

00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:35,300
hoping that covers everyone in the room

00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:37,709
if you are or no this talk is for you I

00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:42,420
want to hear your story I want you to

00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:44,490
email me at story at django girls org so

00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,040
what is your django story your ginger

00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:49,350
story is an interview that's published

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:53,430
weekly to our official Jago girls blog

00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:55,589
its blog django girls org we try to

00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:57,149
publish a new story every week I'm the

00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:59,670
one who publishes them it's really

00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:01,350
exciting all experience levels are

00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:02,970
welcome it doesn't matter if you're new

00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,709
to python or you've been doing it for

00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:08,010
years we still want to hear your story

00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:09,899
and it is a great way to share what

00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:13,680
you're working on or care about with the

00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:15,569
community so Anna Schneider talked about

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,339
what time here I interviewed her a

00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:19,649
couple months ago and now she's a jenga

00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:20,970
con so it's great if you're trying to

00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:22,430
like build your brand or you want to

00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:24,510
share your story or what you care about

00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:28,230
there are lots of opportunities to do

00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:29,699
that so I just want to go ahead and put

00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,620
out these are the questions that you

00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:34,199
would be asked all the questions are

00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:36,240
optional there are the questions that we

00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,589
came up with and that we think work but

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,180
you don't have to answer every one of

00:15:37,589 --> 00:15:41,639
them if you don't find it relevant or if

00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:44,339
you don't like it how did your story

00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:46,040
with codes start tell us about that what

00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:48,269
did you do before becoming a programmer

00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,670
what do you love the most about coding

00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:52,740
why do you love Django what cool

00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:56,459
projects are you working on so pretty

00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:59,399
pretty easy this slide is not in the

00:15:56,459 --> 00:16:01,500
right place but this is an example of a

00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:03,839
recent story we had we we share an image

00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,490
if you're cool with that I love this

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,240
story you should check it out and a

00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:11,160
story here are the other questions what

00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,300
in your life are you most proud of you

00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,430
can say your kids you could say your

00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,730
family you could say your partner you

00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:17,800
could say something you built

00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:20,589
what are you curious about what do you

00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,570
like doing in your free time one of my

00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:25,420
favorite parts about this interview

00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:28,180
series is this question what advice do

00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:30,490
you have for newbies I care a lot about

00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:32,199
code newbies I care a lot about folks

00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,149
who are new to programming and if you

00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:36,610
read our blogs in these interviews this

00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:38,320
is where some of the best material comes

00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:42,220
from it's usually what I use for our

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,440
tweets so love to hear that and if it

00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,940
applies to you if you attended a django

00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,500
girls event what did you get out of it

00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:50,290
how did it change your life and that's

00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:53,949
you can come at that angle either as an

00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:56,260
attendee a participant or as a coach so

00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:58,240
it doesn't matter so I hope I have

00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:59,620
convinced you or made you think of

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,779
somebody who you could talk to about

00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:04,480
sharing their story please email me

00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:06,819
story at django girls org we'd love to

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:13,299
feature you get you queued up to be

00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:16,209
published thanks so much I'm going to

00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:18,730
give a content warning at the start I'm

00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:21,610
going to mention sexual assault but just

00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:24,970
kind of in the reporting of it so last

00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:27,100
year Kelsey gilmar Ennis gave a talk I

00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:29,380
think it was called at django con i

00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,059
think it was called making django really

00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,460
really ridiculously secure or something

00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:36,160
like that and she mentioned what it was

00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:41,140
about a project called Callisto who here

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:43,330
knows what Callisto is okay good so for

00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:47,740
those of you who don't Callisto is a

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:49,510
tool right now that's used for collet

00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:52,270
for reporting sexual assault on college

00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:56,610
campuses it's designed to be kind of a

00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:59,919
more empowering reporting experience and

00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:02,590
it's trauma-informed and it's also

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:05,980
designed to kind of facilitate the

00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:08,220
identification of repeat assailants and

00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:12,540
so though it's based on this information

00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:14,799
escrow concept so you can report

00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:19,000
something happens to you you can report

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:21,280
the details of what happened to you like

00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
when it's still fresh in your mind but

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,720
then decide on your own time when and if

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,190
you're going to do anything with that

00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,450
report so it belongs to you it's

00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,410
encrypted it's stored in this third

00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,150
party place

00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:34,330
where no one really other than you has

00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:36,040
any legal authority to access it even if

00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:38,130
their sub painted by a court it's all

00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:42,070
encrypted and you can only decrypt it so

00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:43,540
they can't even get it that way and then

00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,610
you can decide if you want to report

00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,080
that to an authority but the really

00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:51,460
great thing is it has a matching feature

00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:53,920
where you can identify your assailant

00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:56,560
right now it's via facebook URL since

00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:59,290
almost everyone has facebook and then

00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:01,300
and say if anyone else reports the same

00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:04,420
assailant then audit you know

00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:07,090
automatically report so both of your

00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:10,140
reports at that moment will get reported

00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:12,760
to the proper authorities wherever it is

00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:15,100
so it's used on college campuses but

00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:18,280
it's kind of and it's it's a it's a

00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:21,850
general you know the kind of a system

00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:23,590
and the core reporting machinery could

00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:26,290
be used in a variety of situations it

00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:29,290
could be used in the workplace or in the

00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:31,390
military or any kind of place where that

00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:34,150
we're kind of reporting confidential

00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:35,950
information about something that's

00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:38,190
happened to you where that would be

00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:40,330
important like this could be used and so

00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:42,040
the reason I'm talking about this is I'm

00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,750
there's going to be a sprint I'm going

00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:47,500
to organize the sprint on Thursday and

00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:49,590
Friday to make a close till recently

00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,670
open sourced the kind of underlying

00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:54,220
escrow code and the encryption of

00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:58,870
reports and all that and we're going to

00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:00,700
work on making a generic django app that

00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:04,300
kind of provides an example of how you

00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:06,130
could implement that stuff in kind of a

00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:09,730
generic way hopefully that other other

00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:12,400
places could then use in their own kind

00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:14,320
of organizations so if you're interested

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,790
in working on that then find me tomorrow

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:20,500
morning there's a channel in this and

00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:23,710
the Django con slack called sprint

00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:25,740
Callisto so you can find us in there and

00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:29,560
once we figure out where we are tomorrow

00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:31,120
and I we could use basically I can't

00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,190
imagine the skill that we couldn't use

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,990
like where there's going to be

00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:38,740
documentation writing front and back-end

00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:40,450
development design work if anyone has

00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:42,520
like any kind of experience with like

00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,909
trauma-informed design like that would

00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,019
be

00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:48,549
super useful but really I think whatever

00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:50,229
you want to however you want to help I'm

00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:54,999
sure we can find a way for that work so

00:20:50,229 --> 00:20:57,389
thank you thank you gether ID so who

00:20:54,999 --> 00:21:04,059
here has heard of Jango make humph I

00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:08,799
work with you nobody's heard of this it

00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:14,590
is as a library it makes conferences no

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:15,729
wait it generates configuration files so

00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:18,519
why would you want to generate a

00:21:15,729 --> 00:21:20,440
configuration file some of you guys

00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:22,989
probably use ansible and chef you have

00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,669
this whole ecosystem made there and it's

00:21:22,989 --> 00:21:26,789
always right the first time I'm sure

00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:29,080
anybody who's used chef you get it right

00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:30,879
but I've been using a lot of

00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,499
platform-as-a-service stuff it's really

00:21:30,879 --> 00:21:34,690
simple and I need to get like one

00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:42,309
setting into my application who uses

00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:43,779
Heroku elastic Beanstalk ok I use

00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:45,489
elastic Beanstalk but I think all this

00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:47,229
stuff would work for Heroku too and if

00:21:45,489 --> 00:21:49,720
anybody wants to help me make it work

00:21:47,229 --> 00:21:52,960
for Heroku I'll cover that in the last

00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:55,629
slide but basically I wanted to use my

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,239
django settings file that i already have

00:21:55,629 --> 00:22:00,269
to just generate other files like a

00:21:58,239 --> 00:22:02,200
docker file or something like that

00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:04,720
rather than having some whole other

00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,179
ecosystem so I made this really

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,190
complicated system that uses Django

00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:10,779
templates which we already know and love

00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:16,179
and Django settings which we already

00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:18,519
know and love to create other files so

00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:21,429
i'm using like pie Danny's configuration

00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:24,999
I use different settings files based on

00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:26,950
the tier i'm using and i just include a

00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:28,779
couple of extra settings in these files

00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:33,159
or use settings I've already got to make

00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:35,049
my templates work so you might end up

00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:37,239
including AWS bucket names for

00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:39,489
deployment or roll names or resource

00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:41,950
locations and you might put these things

00:22:39,489 --> 00:22:48,210
in any files cron files docker files

00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:51,489
whatever this is an example of

00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:54,429
generating as a template you would use

00:22:51,489 --> 00:22:56,409
to generate from your settings

00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:57,850
and you can see it's taking like your

00:22:56,409 --> 00:23:00,759
credentials location which is going to

00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:03,190
be a link to AWS and like an elastic

00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:05,049
beanstalk role-name in this case that

00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:06,940
don't use the bottom of this I'd shorten

00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:10,720
it a lot this isn't actually how AWS

00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:12,220
works but but it fits on one slide down

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,210
anyway but you just got a couple of

00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:17,259
things that are coming from your

00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:19,570
settings and you know you could use that

00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:21,309
to deploy different credentials based on

00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:23,169
the terrier and if hopefully you're not

00:23:21,309 --> 00:23:26,649
using the same credentials and proddin

00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:28,720
who knows I also made a little helper to

00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:31,179
get settings from the environment into

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,999
the template and it ends up working like

00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:36,639
a foot or so you have to load may come

00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:38,950
to get in Viron but you can then like

00:23:36,639 --> 00:23:40,720
this is a Mikey built this he's in the

00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,580
audience and this uses Jenkins

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,580
environment variables to put a little

00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:49,929
footer in in his side so he knows which

00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:53,619
like did Mike did my code deploy is this

00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:55,799
the release i thought it was and that's

00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:58,690
just getting input environment variables

00:23:55,799 --> 00:24:00,369
and to set it up use a map there's two

00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,990
ways to do it but this is sure that you

00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:03,610
can just make a map and you're saying i

00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:06,159
want to make a file called docker file

00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:08,289
and i want to make it from this template

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,899
and it will have access to your settings

00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:12,429
in your environment and that's just

00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:15,610
going to generate a docker file in the

00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:17,799
current directory the other way to do it

00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:19,950
is with elastic Beanstalk modules and I

00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:23,950
can imagine having Heroku modules also

00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:25,809
this in you know how I've they're not

00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:28,720
published because they're all secret top

00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:30,249
secret and I made them at my job but you

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,019
can have modules for like different

00:24:30,249 --> 00:24:33,340
things New Relic or HipChat or if you

00:24:32,019 --> 00:24:34,899
use SAS and you need certain

00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:38,320
dependencies I just have little modules

00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:39,879
that drop in and this i is less you put

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,920
them kind of an order in case one is

00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:44,050
needed before another one

00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:48,180
and you just run it with the management

00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:48,180
command so I do this in my Jenkins build

00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:54,010
using the curt the settings you want to

00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:58,560
use run mate conf generates files its

00:24:54,010 --> 00:25:05,620
magic and then said to pull requests

00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:07,420
thank you my name is Dan deeds I'm one

00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,920
of the partners at both effect a django

00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:11,920
web development agency in Greenville

00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:14,230
South Carolina last year I gave a

00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:17,500
lightning talk on fabric bulb which is a

00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:19,810
django project we support that allows

00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,220
you to run fabric deployments right from

00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,830
your browser so you could be a project

00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:27,310
manager click a button and it goes so

00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:31,600
it's really cool and so that's up there

00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:34,180
for SEO reasons we just added channels

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,650
to that project so jared has a pending

00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:38,290
poetry classy shakin his head right now

00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:40,930
I had no idea what is a mug shot in

00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:42,040
there so anyway we're going to get that

00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:43,510
pushed out so if you want to see

00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,070
challenge run in a real project there

00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:46,780
you go what I'm going to talk about

00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:50,740
today though is things that I share with

00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:52,870
my students at the iron yard I'm a an

00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:55,450
instructor for the iron yard we help

00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:58,000
people move into programming careers

00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:59,380
that are fulfilling so non-programmers

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,610
we turn them into programmers it's

00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:06,610
really awesome so there's research that

00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:10,600
suggests teaching the mechanism of how

00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:13,120
the brain grows when it's challenged

00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,950
increases performance so you learn

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,900
better if I tell you a little bit about

00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:19,170
how your brain works one thing we need

00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:21,040
to know is learning is kind of like

00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:23,710
trekking across the Appalachian Trail

00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:26,230
not climbing Mount Everest so we're

00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:28,000
talking about learning complex skills

00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:29,530
like programming you're going to do this

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,650
over a lifetime it's going to take a

00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:34,420
long time there are two things I want to

00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:36,300
talk about real quick before we dive in

00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:40,870
cut the comfort zone and a panic zone

00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:42,760
kind of look like this where you

00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:44,860
basically have the comfort zone no

00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,120
learnings happening we have the learning

00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,170
zone where you're pushing yourself to

00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,730
learn something new and then you have

00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:52,390
the panic zone where you're freaking out

00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:54,730
okay what we want to try to do is get as

00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,260
close to the panic zone as possible

00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:57,900
while

00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:00,510
in that learning zone to maximize what's

00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,640
happening now the reason for that is fo

00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:05,670
learning is longer lasting and more

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,900
versatile learning is built on the

00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:08,430
shoulders of habits at things that you

00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:11,130
do on a regular basis is how you're

00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:13,800
going to learn be aware of cognitive

00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:17,190
bias so we oftentimes think we know

00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:19,950
stuff when we don't so test yourself be

00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:21,420
aware of falsely perceived fluency you

00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:22,770
could read something 10 times and that

00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:25,320
doesn't mean you actually know something

00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:28,820
right so just rereading things a bunch

00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:31,800
of times maybe not be so helpful

00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:33,930
retrieval interrupts forgetting and

00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,550
strengthens retrieval pathways so the

00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:37,770
way your brain works is you're

00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:40,560
connecting these neurons in your brain

00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:42,510
together through these pathways and as

00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,010
you try to retrieve information from

00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:45,450
your brain whether or not you get the

00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,160
right answer it turns out that actually

00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:48,630
helps your learning now if you come up

00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,720
with the wrong answer hopefully you've

00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:53,160
got the right answer close at hand you

00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,380
don't want to just have the wrong answer

00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:58,850
that doesn't help but just the act of

00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:01,260
trying to retrieve helps you learn make

00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:03,750
retrieval harder with spaced repetition

00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:06,750
and interleaving interleaving is this

00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:08,220
idea of having multiple topics so I

00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:11,280
would suggest if you're trying to learn

00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:13,860
a little bit of advanced CSS you go

00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,870
ahead and sprinkle in some sequel query

00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:18,360
stuff so you're going to interleave

00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:19,860
topics which helps you forget the CSS

00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,630
that you were just working on and then

00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,970
you come back and you retrieve that

00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:26,760
information and that will actually

00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:28,970
increase your learning try to solve

00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:33,480
problems before you're taught how

00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:36,030
learning styles are overrated always aim

00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,740
to extract principles and rules so you

00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:39,390
want to pull concepts out of things that

00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:42,900
you're learning so that you can apply

00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:46,140
them in a different context elaborate on

00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:48,210
newly gained knowledge so as you're

00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,880
bringing in new knowledge you want to

00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:53,160
kind of beef it up a little bit this is

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,220
a lot to read so i will post these

00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:58,440
slides will will have them write a blog

00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,480
post on bolt effect calm get those out

00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,860
to you so if you want to read all that

00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,630
build a mind palace sounds completely

00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,060
weird but totally works there's people

00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:08,100
that have memorized thousands of digits

00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,640
of pi there's no limit to what your

00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,590
brain

00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,920
actually store we haven't at least found

00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:16,050
what that limit is so you need to kind

00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,450
of work to store things in there in

00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:21,300
creative ways it turns out that

00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:23,370
intellectual ability isn't fixed it's

00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:25,320
not like you're born with some amount of

00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:27,900
information that you can store and

00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:31,290
that's it so mindset and learning

00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:35,070
actually changes your brain and let you

00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:37,080
soak some stuff in stay calm so if you

00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:38,550
get into that panic zone so you try and

00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,480
bite off a little bit more than you can

00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:44,850
chew it actually causes your brain to

00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,140
lose some of the plasticity there and so

00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:48,510
you want to even if you're doing some

00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,620
challenging learning stay calm in review

00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:52,940
here's all the things that we just

00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:57,140
learned about learning nice huh and

00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:57,140
that's it the thanks thank you very much

00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:02,220
ok cool it looks like a bit my secret

00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,540
key i'm going to talk really fast so

00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,520
let's say you have an idea for the best

00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,780
thing ever you do Django I'm n PI star

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,620
project best thing ever because of

00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,360
course you're going to build the best

00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,650
thing ever in Django you do get in it

00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,520
because you are responsible developer

00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:14,100
you want to put this in source control

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:17,910
get add dot get commit m initial commit

00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:19,620
get push origin master this is not

00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:20,910
something you should do because what

00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,680
have you just done you've just committed

00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:24,360
your secret key to a probably open

00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:27,300
repository because you're probably using

00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:29,400
github like most of the room so you have

00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,810
made a huge mistake wait have I made a

00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,310
huge mistake what are we this what is

00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:34,550
the secret he actually get used for the

00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:36,990
answers yes you have made a huge mistake

00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:38,940
there should be no doubt about this here

00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:41,250
is what here is a list of what the

00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:43,980
secret key is used for sign cookies

00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:45,720
secure sessions password reset tokens

00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,800
shout out to Russell who put this one

00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,210
out to me yesterday and then I went and

00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,820
looked in the source code and yes the

00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:52,800
password reset tokens are generated from

00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,660
the secret key so that means if your

00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,430
secret key is public someone can

00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:59,850
impersonate your users and potentially

00:30:56,430 --> 00:31:01,980
change their passwords this is bad what

00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:04,470
do you do i'm about to show a big block

00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,550
of code it's for one reason the slides

00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,660
will be posted there's a link at the end

00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:09,420
so you don't need to understand this

00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:11,220
just just kind of a point of view you

00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:12,840
should be putting secret things in

00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,460
environment variables those environment

00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,600
burials can actually live in the

00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,010
environment or they can live in a

00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,540
separate file that you import but they

00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:20,160
should not live in source control this

00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:22,230
big ol block of code is that you can do

00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,770
this and this is how you should be

00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:25,800
accessing

00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:27,210
secret keys if you have a stat a static

00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,700
secret key in production please use

00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:30,780
environment variables okay so you've

00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,950
made this huge mistake how do you get a

00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,450
new key so you can put in an environment

00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:37,350
variable and not have your users be

00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:39,990
hacked to really easy ways one is use

00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:42,510
this web tool if you it will generate a

00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:44,220
50 character Django secret key if you

00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:45,480
are super paranoid and don't want your

00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:48,330
secret key to ever even touch the

00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,400
internet you can do this this will prove

00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:51,750
a kind of alpha- eric ish but it's

00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,030
included in the standard library in

00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:55,860
Django very easy to use you might be

00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:57,630
asking yourself okay well if i change my

00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,980
secret key what about my users well

00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:00,210
anything bad happen to them if I rotate

00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,950
my secret key the worst that will happen

00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,120
is that they will have to login again

00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:04,740
because the session cookies will no

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,170
longer be valid however them having to

00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,550
log again in again is way better than

00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:09,650
their account getting hacked and them

00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,850
calling you in the middle of the night

00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:13,770
there's an optional step which is you

00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:15,180
could not have a permanent key if you

00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:16,110
have an auth mechanism like some of the

00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,240
ones that have been discussed earlier

00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:20,010
that doesn't rely on session Keys and

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,090
session cookies then you don't need to

00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:24,210
have a permanent secret key and it

00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:25,890
doesn't matter if you store it so think

00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:27,740
about this but really investigate

00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:32,330
whether this is going to work for you

00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:35,160
that is it so I am giving a talk at

00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:38,910
one-thirty about more Django security

00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:41,430
issues at 115 in here I'm going to try

00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:42,690
to run a very large game of cat on your

00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:44,520
head it is a game that you can play

00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:46,290
sitting down in a conference center and

00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,210
is better with large groups of people so

00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:49,380
115 come back here and play some cat on

00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:51,840
your head that's the link to these

00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:53,370
slides if you want my block of how to

00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,660
get environment variables and I'm giving

00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:59,880
a talk at one-thirty I already said that

00:32:54,660 --> 00:33:02,100
and I'm done thank you I am hi subra MKV

00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,200
and that's what I am from a tapar Kayla

00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,760
and I've flown like what 23 hours in the

00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,100
flight to get to that Justice conference

00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:11,210
so I'll be here for just this week so

00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,210
thank you so much for having me

00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:17,799
yes I was telling everyone the sun sets

00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:21,370
at like 830 p.m. over here what's up

00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:23,169
with that cool so I'm here to talk about

00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:26,740
bike on India which is happening on sep

00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:28,299
tember 24 125 last year we had it in

00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:30,130
bangalore which is like the tech capital

00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:31,780
of india some people refer to it but

00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:33,730
this year we have shifted it towards the

00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:35,830
north which is the actual capital of

00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:37,419
india new delhi and just to give you a

00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:41,530
few stats the number of attendants for

00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:42,640
icon in the last year was 1137 those

00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:45,549
many people actually add in the

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:49,570
conference and the ticket price for the

00:33:45,549 --> 00:33:51,190
conference as $25 which gives you like

00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:53,590
two days of conference three times food

00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:55,600
and like to meet like thousand people in

00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:57,490
like two days which if you think it's

00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,669
cheap people still bicker about it over

00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:02,679
india when we acted try to decide price

00:33:59,669 --> 00:34:04,690
so yeah there you go that's how we name

00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:07,390
our tickets like late poison and regular

00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:08,830
poison and stuff just share a few photos

00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:10,210
and stuff which he have done I was

00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:12,490
actually the registration lead last year

00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:15,119
so that's our registration booth I am
