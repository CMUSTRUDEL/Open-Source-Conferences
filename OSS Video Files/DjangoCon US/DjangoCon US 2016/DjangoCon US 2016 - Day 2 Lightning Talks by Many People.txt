	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
come on

00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:22,910
so hi I'm Lucy and I'm already missing

00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:26,450
things okay every time is doing that so

00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:28,160
yeah so hi everyone able to see and for

00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:30,140
the people do didn't saw me at the booth

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,210
today or yesterday i'm working for

00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:35,989
django girls so I'm they are awesomeness

00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:39,860
ambassador so junk overs is a foundation

00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:41,510
that helps organize a workshop around

00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,750
the world so it's free one-day workshop

00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:48,560
for women we studied two years ago and

00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:51,110
now we have a person Utley 6,000 people

00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,340
that went through a workshop so I've

00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,140
attended the first gen boogers in

00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,330
building whether what I was a total

00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,790
beginners are programming and since then

00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:01,490
I've organized to workshop in Paris and

00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,079
coach at seven events in Europe so I

00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:05,449
wanted to share with you what I've

00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,100
learned about teaching so teaching is

00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:08,900
happening all the time and not only

00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,619
during beginner's workshop it could be a

00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:15,079
friend asking for help or colleague at

00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:17,180
works so sadly there is no magic recipe

00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:18,800
to make you a great teacher that there

00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,590
is a thing a list of things that you

00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,479
should absolutely not you for example

00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,159
you may want to grab the keyboard from

00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:27,340
the hand of someone that you to show

00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:30,110
them quick here what you want them to do

00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,940
you shouldn't do that really dumb don't

00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,380
do it because it's true though you're

00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,030
taking the keyboard from the hand of

00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,770
someone who is currently using it and

00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,320
imagine if it's a laptop you currently

00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:41,750
taking away the laptop so don't do that

00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,340
because also it's humiliating you're

00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,869
literally saying to this person that

00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,930
they won't be able to fix that problem

00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:50,240
and that's wrong so what should you do

00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:52,369
if you can't see the screen as the

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,260
person if they can turn the screen or

00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:56,570
move a little bit if you need more

00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:59,390
detail on a to be able to have them

00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:01,490
develop a code as them or explain them

00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,830
how to do it for example you can say can

00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:06,650
you show me the log or can you type git

00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:09,470
status press enter so the main idea is

00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:11,569
also to teach them tricks so they will

00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,340
be able to debug the code when you're

00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:14,750
not there and it's really important

00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,170
because it will also add them build

00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:20,030
confidence that yes they can fix stuff

00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:22,279
the single things you all may want to do

00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,019
is send something not nice about the

00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:25,310
operating system the software or

00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:27,180
programming language the people are

00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,950
using so let me

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,159
be clear on that someone asks for your

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,989
help not your opinion so the last time I

00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,480
attending a programming workshop someone

00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:39,060
said to me cool someone on Linux that's

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,769
one less problem the thing is that was

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,109
absolutely not true because I spent more

00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:45,299
than an hour to debug and nasty bugs you

00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:47,489
make things works and secondly that's

00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:49,950
also a meeting again for the people that

00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:51,719
were there not using Linux and were

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,510
studied to think what is wrong with my

00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:56,879
eyes so people come into programming

00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,980
workshop or looking for help end up

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,930
about the skills knowledge or even

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:04,680
legitimate e to ask you a question or be

00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:06,540
on a workshop programming so your job is

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,400
like I said to help them build

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,530
confidence and also make sure they have

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,439
a great time learning so no nasty

00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:16,079
comments or judging and by the way don't

00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,840
even start about trolling with other

00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:20,609
attendees or learners because you're not

00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,409
here to prove you the biggest geek in

00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:24,989
this part of town you're here again to

00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:27,510
help people learn something so to resume

00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:30,299
not taking the keyboard not judging not

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:33,510
rolling that's maybe a lot of notes so

00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:36,000
what can you do you can help them by

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,769
building a friendly environment so to do

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,900
that we must respect the person you're

00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:43,260
teaching to you so don't do sexist

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,120
racist or a blessing ablaze jokes no

00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,870
it's easy my grandma could do it or

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,579
other suitable ISM try to also create a

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,250
relation where they can feel they can

00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:55,049
ask question if you do that tell them

00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,489
that no they won't bother you with all

00:03:55,049 --> 00:04:00,090
the question because you're here to help

00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:01,769
them also try to answer the question

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,560
positively you can say something like

00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:06,599
it's a good question I'm not sure so

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,069
let's check on the internet and also

00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:09,840
don't ever act surprised by the question

00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:12,900
because they need to know that you want

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:17,070
to judge them also try to be in their

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:19,500
shoes whoops let's start again so try to

00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,449
be in their shoes do not use jargon or

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,430
don't say things like it's simple you

00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:25,080
just have to do this because it's

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,370
probably simple for you but it may not

00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,919
be the case for the person you're

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:31,050
teaching to you and finally building a

00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:33,060
friendly environment also to need mean

00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,400
checking if the person needs a break or

00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,870
it's getting frustrating most of the

00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,400
people are taught during opinion of

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,620
workshops and she spend the whole day

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,900
infinite luncheon

00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,960
of the computer so doing state to invite

00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,760
them to take breaks so be patient

00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,860
encouraging and remember that new

00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,510
learners can be slow which can be really

00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,210
frustrating for you try to remember

00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:55,370
they're going through a lot so be ready

00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,080
to repeat in expel things mythical time

00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:59,120
and also tell them it's okay if they

00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,070
don't know everything so be friendly

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,500
celebrate small and big victories and

00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,870
don't ever show your frustration keep in

00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,669
mind that you're here to empower them so

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,590
if you want to know more about how to

00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:11,750
teach programming to someone you can

00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:14,660
check our guide coach the jungle juice

00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:17,900
org and I strongly invite you to go to

00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:24,169
Nicole gem stocks tomorrow at 220 thanks

00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:28,880
for your attention I will be talking

00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:33,169
about using es6 scss in Django another

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:37,400
way so I start we have five minutes

00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:40,490
begin great might be even faster so I

00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,919
think some of you already know about

00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:46,900
jungle compressor it's jungle

00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:50,750
application which provides you very nice

00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:55,550
asset management and static handling

00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:58,610
stuff so i am using it for a long time

00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:01,940
and and there is a way to use es6 and

00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:05,690
SCSS and it but you need to write some

00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:08,090
mapping between some stuff and note

00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,580
commands so it's not very convenient and

00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:12,229
I have made my little addition to jungle

00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,080
compressor which called Jungle

00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:18,650
compressor toolkit and let me just show

00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:21,320
you the results first so here I created

00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:24,410
just entering the last presentation one

00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:30,560
junga project and we have to jungle

00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:34,550
occasions base and up so first in inside

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:38,660
base I have some basic stuff for es6 4s

00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:41,510
CSS and inside another application we

00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,820
want to use it we want to import from GS

00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:47,479
from es6 from some another junk

00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:50,479
application and same for scss we want to

00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:51,740
have cross imports between junga

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,380
applications

00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:58,639
because I prefer to keep static inside

00:06:54,380 --> 00:07:02,210
jungles not in one separate folder so

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:05,060
now about installation yeah you need to

00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:11,030
install it the Python package and then

00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:14,599
to configure it bit small screen so here

00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:17,330
I just install my compressor toolkit the

00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:22,789
that's jungle compressor and that's mine

00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:27,169
so you use this mapping for scss and for

00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:32,659
es6 and inside junga template using

00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:36,080
compressor you include just your final

00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:39,620
application I CSS and JavaScript inside

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:43,250
which you reuse some another es6 from

00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:48,349
another plication so that's the insides

00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:55,880
and now how does it work does it work at

00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:58,550
all yay it works the link is red and yes

00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:02,060
six is transpired compile merged

00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:07,759
minified and executed and that's the

00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:12,259
great success that's it I suggest you to

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:14,630
use it great thanks so yeah my name is

00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:17,840
Tobias McNulty I am the CEO at cactus

00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:20,630
group we are a 30-person Django

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,139
consultancy based in North Carolina we

00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:25,639
have been using Django since 2007 and

00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:27,650
it's it's been a really huge part of our

00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:29,449
success number of our staff have

00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:32,599
contributed back to django over the

00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:34,789
years and this is my pitch to all of you

00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,250
to get involved and contribute and to

00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:41,079
show you why i think that's important i

00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,079
just want to start with a recent example

00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:50,680
so raise your hands and keep them up how

00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:53,889
many of you have used a model file field

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:57,370
before okay so a lot of people and now

00:08:53,889 --> 00:09:00,070
if you keep them up if you have how many

00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,440
of you have used that to store a file

00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:05,139
field in a remote storage like s3

00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:09,130
previously so also a lot of people and

00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:11,589
how many of you had to use the shark did

00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:13,180
not have to use the Django documentation

00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:14,800
to do that so how many of you were able

00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,740
to do that without using the Django docs

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,060
so okay so document like maybe two or

00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:22,029
three people still had their hands up so

00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,829
documentation very important a few

00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:27,100
months back I was working to move

00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:29,800
content from a text field into a file

00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,839
field for project after reading through

00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,839
the Django docs like any number of times

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,329
i stumbled on this stack overflow post

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,949
here you know the post kind of shows a

00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:41,860
timeline of a conversation about file

00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:43,589
field on the first one says what is the

00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,550
purpose of this file fueled open method

00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:47,889
somebody else seven months later

00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:49,329
responds that you know the docs are a

00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:50,980
little bit misleading on that about a

00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:52,959
year later somebody commented Oh

00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,449
somebody should really raise an issue on

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,160
this and then here I am two and a half

00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:58,600
years later struggling through this

00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,540
trying to figure out what is the purpose

00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,490
of this file field open method and the

00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,350
doctor n changed and no issue was ever

00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:08,649
raised throughout the timeline on this

00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:10,720
point so for those of you who may not be

00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:13,480
aware on Jango has an excellent issue

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,300
tracker at code Django project com if

00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,100
you discover an issue in Django even if

00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,500
you don't have time to dig into it then

00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,639
you know take a few minutes to first you

00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,800
know search for the issue and make sure

00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:25,329
that it doesn't already exist and then

00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,990
if it doesn't you know file a simple

00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:32,019
report on that so I did my due diligence

00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,850
and submitted that issue a few weeks

00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:35,740
later we had one of our quarterly ship

00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,260
at days at cactus and I spent a few

00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:40,660
hours you know working on this and

00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:44,170
within that time was able to get a PR

00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,819
submitted to django master and then you

00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,380
know with some back and forth and code

00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:48,699
review about you know three weeks later

00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,529
it's not something that you can kind of

00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:52,750
expect to get in immediately but within

00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:53,950
three weeks this really tiny changed the

00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,430
documentation that i had

00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:58,750
was merged into Chanku court and you

00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,760
know I think this is a really minor

00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,950
change if this is helpful to at least

00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,960
one other person in the future I will

00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:07,360
feel like that investment of my time was

00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,650
worthwhile and you know I also think

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,140
it's court to note that this is really

00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:12,880
just one tiny tiny change in the history

00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:15,870
of literally thousands of patches that

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:19,870
have helped make Django what it is today

00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:21,310
so speaking of thousands of patches you

00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,260
know why do all of these people

00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:27,550
volunteer their time and energy to

00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:28,960
contribute to Jenga core for those new

00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:32,920
to django it's a great opportunity to

00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:35,140
learn and dig into how ginga works you

00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,850
also get free expert code reviews from

00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,560
some of the most knowledgeable people in

00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:41,140
the community many of whom are here at

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,730
the conference this week you get to feel

00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,290
good you know not only about creating

00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:46,840
something but also you know about being

00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:48,700
part of this community and you know

00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,290
lastly of course contributions to open

00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,000
source projects you know however small

00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:56,830
can help improve your credentials when

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,270
applying to jobs if you know I've peaked

00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:00,190
your curiosity and you're wondering

00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:02,800
where to start genco has really good

00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:04,840
docs on contributing but you know those

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,850
docs like everything else could always

00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,590
be improved as well so you know as you

00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,270
get started you know trying to set up

00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:12,370
the unit test suite for the first time

00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:14,290
for example use that as kind of a case

00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,580
study to think through what's working

00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,140
and what's not working maybe you

00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:20,950
discover a platform issue that's

00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:23,020
specific to your OS on the subject of

00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:24,370
documentation I was talking to a 10-gram

00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,930
yesterday the Django fellow and he

00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,700
mentioned that his entire first year of

00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:30,220
Django contributions with nothing was

00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,290
nothing but documentation fixes I think

00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:35,200
that's incredible and you know no matter

00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:37,870
sort of how good Django's docs are they

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,760
can always be improved and you know

00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,320
there's two IRC channels I think the

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,580
Django sprint one will be the one that

00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,720
we're using this week there are also you

00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:50,430
know there's a issue track i mentioned

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,430
earlier there a hard

00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:56,200
do I get extra time this week there are

00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,940
two types of Jango's prints Tim Graham

00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,460
is running and running an informal one

00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,560
in the mba lounge upstairs it's a little

00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,970
study alcove just to the left as you

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,350
come and it took me a while to find it

00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:07,450
and then Thursday and Friday will be the

00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:11,830
sprints so thanks very much and hope to

00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:15,160
see you around the conference alright so

00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:17,950
hi I'm Kenneth love my day job is

00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,720
teaching python and django i get to do

00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:21,760
it all through video & online which is

00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,280
kind of cool means i don't get a lot of

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,590
feedback right away but it's still neat

00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:29,020
so for the past couple years I've been

00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:30,300
doing this and I've had hundreds

00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,560
thousands of students around the world

00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:36,010
I've picked up a couple of things that I

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,630
think are handy for teaching so I'm

00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:40,900
going to share this I overlapped with

00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:42,970
Lucy we should have collaborated first

00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,250
of all though I'm not an expert I very

00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:47,800
well might be wrong so if I am tell me

00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:50,610
so that I'll get better but if i'm not

00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:54,150
wrong cool i lucked into something good

00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:56,350
alright so as a teacher as a developer

00:13:54,150 --> 00:14:00,160
trying to teach one of the problems is

00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:02,110
that you know too much so you've solved

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,180
problems you've encountered all these

00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:06,730
errors bugs you've read documentation

00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:10,840
you've gotten onto IRC which is really

00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:12,550
hard for people now you've gotten over

00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,530
your imposter syndrome at least slightly

00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,700
right I mean I still get nervous about

00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,710
teaching I've been doing it for two

00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:20,170
years I put out 30 courses in two years

00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:22,210
and I'm still very nervous about

00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:25,230
teaching people I'm a bit nervous right

00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:27,130
now even and I know most of you

00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,750
beginners don't have any of those

00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,580
advantages though they're full of these

00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,050
unknown unknowns they don't know what

00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,910
they don't know they don't know how to

00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,950
find out what they don't know they don't

00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,940
know any of this stuff that's why

00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:41,280
they're beginners that's why they're

00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:43,480
coming to you to teach them stuff and as

00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,830
part of the holes in a Python thing

00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,430
remember how in the face of uncertainty

00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:50,890
you resist the urge to guess so you have

00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:53,380
to kind of resist that you have to try

00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:55,450
to guess what they don't know but find

00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,620
out if you can anyway let's go back to

00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,750
the beginner mindset this is what you

00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:01,810
need to get you've got to bring yourself

00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:03,820
back to where they are so where were you

00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:07,900
ten years ago five years

00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:11,170
go six months ago if you only have the

00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:14,020
model objects that all query and a for

00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:16,240
loop how would you then filter down the

00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:18,880
records that have a certain PK or a

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,110
certain user name right because lots

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,820
times i only have those two tools they

00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,040
know they have those two they know both

00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,560
of those but they can't figure out the

00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,990
other stuff or they haven't been told so

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,150
when you're teaching try to answer three

00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:33,970
questions tell them what you're going to

00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:35,740
do what that problem solves then tell

00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,880
them why they need to do that or when

00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,260
they're going to need to do that when

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,060
that problem is going to come up and

00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:42,970
then of course teach them how to

00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:45,100
actually solve the thing so you show

00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:48,180
them that they have lambdas when would

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:50,830
they use lambdas why would these lambdas

00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:53,290
alright so then things to avoid when

00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:55,720
you're explaining try to avoid using the

00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:57,400
word easy because things aren't easy to

00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,020
beginners try to avoid simple because

00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,380
things aren't simple none of our stuff

00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:04,210
is simple just and only as Lucy said

00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:07,840
you're not going to just do this thing

00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:10,210
it's not only this problem and all you

00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:13,740
have to do is a hard one to get rid of

00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:16,630
but it's there try not to have that

00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:19,420
another point to bring up moms aren't

00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:22,000
dumb so don't use mom's grandmas dad's

00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:25,090
uncle's grandpas whatever as examples

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:32,440
all these people are very capable just

00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:35,200
don't come on didn't Spotify I get in

00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,450
trouble for that anyway things to add

00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,460
instead of things to avoid try to use

00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:42,040
diverse and inclusive examples as

00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:43,120
Cerrone mentioned yesterday you want to

00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,220
have as big of an audience as possible

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,650
you want to get as many people in mix

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:50,440
engenders air towards feminine and

00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:52,960
non-binary sides on that we have more

00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,030
than enough male examples already if

00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,590
you're using visual aids represent as

00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:59,710
many different types of people as you

00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:01,180
possibly can genders races abilities

00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:04,120
have somebody who floats it doesn't

00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:06,970
matter just bring in stuff and remember

00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:09,640
that in the wide world not everyone fits

00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:12,130
into a first name and last name not all

00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,709
dates show up as a month day year not

00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:18,130
all not all numbers have commas in them

00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:19,990
they have decimals instead I want to

00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,730
share a thing that i got for part of the

00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,880
gender i got an email from a student

00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:26,890
about six months ago they emailed me to

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,300
thank me for using explicitly the word

00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:32,920
they as a pronoun choice and of course

00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:35,170
they self described themselves as brown

00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:38,260
autistic and non-binary or genderqueer

00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:40,990
and they felt like they didn't exist in

00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:45,160
the tech world so it's pretty amazing

00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:47,440
what one word can mean to someone so

00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,450
learnings hard recognize the

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,300
achievements that people have encouraged

00:17:49,450 --> 00:18:02,250
self-care introduced communities like

00:17:52,300 --> 00:18:04,780
cojo here and thank you ok thank you so

00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:08,740
this has my twitter handle if you want

00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:12,480
to follow me or not so a couple things

00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:17,470
that you kind of need to like basically

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:19,690
all long years we use message-oriented

00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:24,570
middleware specifically RabbitMQ for a

00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:24,570
lot of our asynchronous tasks and

00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:31,840
scheduled jobs and this will communicate

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:36,010
with celery cues and exchanges that we

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,980
have set up and also just general basic

00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:41,970
familiarity with pdb

00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:45,450
I would love to go into more detail on

00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:47,520
those times but okay so so he has this

00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:53,220
really cool feature that i stumbled upon

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:55,650
and it's called rdb and it basically is

00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:58,200
very similar to how you would use PDP's

00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:59,520
set trace inside your code used sprinkle

00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,630
it in where you think you're having a

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:08,309
problem and it will give you access to

00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:09,780
the code at runtime so it's it's it was

00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:14,250
surprising to me how easy this was

00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:15,630
actually to put in place given all of

00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,720
the different components that have to

00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:20,669
work together for this to kind of

00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:23,520
solidify so I was going to do a quick

00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:26,100
demo basically the steps are that i'm

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,590
going to start up a rabbit broker i'm

00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,419
going to start up a celery worker that

00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:33,299
has the implementation of the task that

00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:34,830
i want a debug and then i'm going to

00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:37,500
apply an async function that

00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:39,929
communicates with the celery worker to

00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,510
basically start the job and then i'm

00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:51,860
going to attach to the rdb session over

00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:51,860
telnet and profit from that so

00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:59,280
first is rabbit so that's very simple

00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:03,180
just RabbitMQ server next is my celery

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,640
liquor I've already got this whole setup

00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:11,910
to work on a test celery q and I'm just

00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:14,400
logging implemented so that's running

00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:21,680
and next I'm going to use Django the

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:27,030
shell plus and import my task and run it

00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:31,470
so you can see I'm doing just passing a

00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:35,310
message Django con us 316 and I will now

00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:36,780
show you the code it's a very simple

00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,570
task that just print out the message

00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:47,730
that it's given and you can see that I

00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:51,690
have the set choice already in there so

00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:56,510
you'll see back in my my worker it's now

00:20:51,690 --> 00:21:01,640
waiting for a connection from my talent

00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:06,510
so it has the port which is no 6 9 05

00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:08,700
and there I am I'm in pdb and you have I

00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:11,100
make that bigger you have basically all

00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:14,040
of the things that you would normally

00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:16,680
have from PDP you would have you know

00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,630
list help step next that sort of thing

00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,700
so I'm just going to continue here and

00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:28,200
you can see that it will then print out

00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:34,550
my message in the log for hello Django

00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:34,550
con thank you

00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:41,670
so I'm here to say my name is all

00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:42,720
probably know that and I for the last

00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:44,640
couple of months I've been working with

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,410
the tsf Code of Conduct committee and

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,900
today we are now seeing quite an

00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,700
exciting thing for us we pull hallett

00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,170
one of our other members are elated at

00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:55,830
your fight and which was like an hour

00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:57,150
ago so we are synchronizing say and so

00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:59,580
we've been working for a couple of weeks

00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:01,410
now and so I'm going to tell you about

00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:04,560
what we've been working on and what we

00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:06,060
do so let's start with what we do so the

00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,400
tears of Code of Conduct committee is

00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,780
job it's just a group of people whose

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,820
job is to make sure that django

00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:14,130
community provides a harassment for

00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:16,260
experience for everyone involved we deal

00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:18,600
with and keep record of code of conduct

00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:21,420
violations as well as provide support

00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:23,750
for conference organizers for moderators

00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:27,090
of tango online spaces like reddit or

00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:29,550
meaningless and to help them keep their

00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:32,460
members safe so we're currently seven

00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:34,020
people scattered across the world we've

00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:38,130
got members in australia and europe

00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:41,160
africa and states and it makes arranging

00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:45,000
meetings very fun we had night one at

00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:47,850
8am today so today I'd like to tell you

00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,060
a little bit about the thing we've been

00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:54,020
working on for DES couple of weeks which

00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:56,550
is making our internal degradation

00:22:54,020 --> 00:23:00,030
existing at all and then make it public

00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:01,200
today so starting from so this

00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:04,140
documentation is going to contain

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,820
everything from how exactly we are doing

00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:09,030
with the issues that are reported to us

00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:11,610
through establishing on like the on-call

00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:13,710
rotation duty we've got now to make sure

00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:16,830
we don't forget about our own well-being

00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:18,420
and burnout so everything is in there so

00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:21,360
you can now go and check it out and

00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:24,000
github it's open source we were creating

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,440
Creative Commons license and I will tell

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,060
you now very briefly while you can find

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,090
inside but i really encourage you to

00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:31,290
check it out and read it on your own so

00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,730
the first structure you can learn about

00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:34,860
the structure of the membership of the

00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:37,470
community hotel you who are the members

00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:39,630
when they joined and when they're terram

00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:41,340
at the community ends you can also find

00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:42,960
out how members are added and removed

00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,900
from the community so it's all

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,920
transparent now then we also dive

00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,870
straight into the most important chapter

00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,580
of the whole thing which is how we

00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:54,010
handle code of conduct evaluations and

00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:55,930
you can learn about our uncle duty

00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:58,360
animesh and go for the entire process

00:23:55,930 --> 00:24:00,340
since the report is made until it's

00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,530
considered closed as well as learning

00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:05,830
about a shepherding and how we make

00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:07,690
decisions then the equally important

00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:10,150
section is dedicated to the way we keep

00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:12,220
records who has access and for how long

00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:15,300
and how is your information and where we

00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:18,490
saw it it's all in there and public and

00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:20,260
one of the most valuable services we

00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:22,300
provide to the community is a central

00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:24,550
record of all code of conduct violations

00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:27,250
that took place in different often very

00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:29,920
disconnected parts of our community so

00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:31,860
we are now quite we've done this for a

00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:34,120
while but now we're quite officially

00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,500
offering a way for community organizers

00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,960
to reach out to us before the event

00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:40,120
takes place place and to make sure that

00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,370
none of the attendees is blacklisted

00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,080
with us and we also extend this

00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:46,740
invitation to use the service other

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,420
python communities not just dangle and

00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:51,640
last but not least you can find about

00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:53,530
how we handle transparency and see

00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,480
statistics of reports and actions taken

00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:57,580
as well as a number of blacklisted and

00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,790
flak people and we are still trying to

00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:03,130
expand on this section in the future but

00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:05,980
so we hope this is just a small step

00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:07,660
toward something bigger so what's the

00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:09,490
goal we hope that making this

00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:11,620
documentation public is going to help us

00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:13,480
raise awareness about the work we are

00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:15,630
doing as well as mystified the process

00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,620
of what happens when your body's might

00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:19,840
realize that code of conduct can be

00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:22,240
scary for some and we'd like to show you

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,400
exactly how we go with issues arising so

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,210
the decision to report something is a

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,200
straightforward and obvious as possible

00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:30,910
we also hope that making this

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,800
transparent we're going to help other

00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:34,930
communities outside of jungle world to

00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,670
make your processes better because code

00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:39,550
of conduct is own is very important but

00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:41,440
but only one is enforced and just having

00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:42,900
published on the website is not enough

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,250
and it took us quite a while to figure

00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,150
how this whole thing works so we hope

00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:48,610
that we're going to help other

00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:51,070
communities make this happen and that's

00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:53,350
bad unless we are looking to improve our

00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:54,880
processes with your feedback and I

00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:58,780
encourage you to take a look at our

00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,429
issues on our pull requests and and we

00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:03,429
re excited to see your

00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:04,899
but on it and last I like to thank

00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:07,779
everyone having the DSF Code of Conduct

00:26:04,899 --> 00:26:11,369
committee as well as many members of the

00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:11,369
community who had to make this happen

00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:18,249
all right hello i'm rachael i'm here to

00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:20,860
talk about inspiring women to fall in

00:26:18,249 --> 00:26:22,119
line with programming I talk fast and

00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,799
being up here I'm little bit nervous all

00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:25,600
talking faster but that's okay because

00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:29,710
most of you are native English speakers

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:33,519

it's a job that's what I'm focused on it

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,009
they're called knocker uppers and what

00:26:58,509 --> 00:27:02,769
they do is they one of them blow

00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:05,049
something like a stone or to knock the

00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:07,059
window to wake people up before we had

00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:09,220
alarm clocks and the other one would

00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:11,379
knock on with a pole I kind of got

00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:13,269
inspired by seeing another talk by Sally

00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:16,690
Williams and she was explained that jobs

00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:20,529
change and jobs are changing now too so

00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:22,419
let me talk about this so this is

00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:24,610
something we kind of can relate to a

00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:27,149
jobs are changing this is factory but

00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:29,169
also like in banking traders it's all

00:27:27,149 --> 00:27:32,679
starting to change its called fourth

00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:35,169
Industrial Revolution and so let's take

00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:38,740
a look here the WEF in january of this

00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:40,720
year um but I report in five years not

00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,399
like 20 years from now it's five years

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,679
seven million jobs will disappear and

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:47,230
only two million will be replaced and

00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:50,169
this number it's because smart

00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:51,850
technology robots etc but this number

00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:56,080
will disproportionately affect women

00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:58,509
because for example if this continues

00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,429
for jobs that men will lose only one we

00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:01,809
are a place but for women 20 jobs that

00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:03,850
will be lost only one will be replaced

00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:06,730
so that's why it's really important to

00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:10,269
get more women not just in the schools

00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:12,940
and start education but now ok because

00:28:10,269 --> 00:28:13,900
and it's not just programming its CS

00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,760
plus X I'm

00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:19,780
sure some of you have heard this but

00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:22,420
it's you know cs+ fashion cs+ education

00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:25,720
cs+ medicine it's not a separate field

00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:28,270
they're all going to be combined okay so

00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,980
and how can we do that I'm sure you guys

00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:32,800
have heard this jingle girls a lot

00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:36,580
recently and that's kind of Greg come

00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:39,250
from jingles chapter and soul and jingle

00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:40,600
girls is a one day workshop to inspire

00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,590
room to fall in love with programming so

00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,850
what I want to talk today is about

00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:50,650
what's next this is our workshop and so

00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:52,960
last year was the first what our goal is

00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:54,730
and what I hope to achieve is not just

00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,680
inspiring women but supporting them on

00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:58,840
their next step so after they're

00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:01,810
inspired what do they do in Seoul we

00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:04,630
have a curriculum first workshop and

00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:06,130
then coat camps and we have two month

00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:09,160
code camp to go back to the basics and

00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:11,650
learn python and django HTML CSS and

00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:13,960
then we do two month bass pro camp it's

00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:16,330
all free and with positive support that

00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,560
will focus on making your own projects

00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:19,000
so you've learned it now do something

00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:22,480
with it and that's the best way to learn

00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,250
it all right and here we have if you go

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,040
to our website jingle girl's soul org

00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:29,800
you can see a bunch about 15 projects

00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:33,280
came out of that websites online and we

00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:35,890
even had one android app we also did a

00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:40,060
lot of community event workshops regular

00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:42,100
study meetups on the weekend so I want

00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:43,360
to encourage other cities and other

00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,300
general grows communities or you can

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:49,330
start your own to continue education

00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:51,400
after the workshop alright and we learn

00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:53,680
by doing and master by teaching we're

00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,360
working on nonprofit website I'd like

00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,010

girls code camp there's a light

00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:26,260
leadership non-profit project for our

00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,970
school in Peru we're making and

00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:30,150
so we're trying to develop a curriculum

00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:33,160
for supporting women after the workshop

00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:34,900
so I hope I inspired you to help us

00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:40,330
inspire women to fall nova program thank

00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:41,350
you so I wanted to start off today and I

00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:43,480
have some notes but I'm going to try to

00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:45,310
not look at or follow them very much who

00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,990
in the room is used docker before you

00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:50,110
see a show of hands so I see some hands

00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:53,710
not up that's good some of you will not

00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:56,200
know that I don't know what I'm doing so

00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:57,850
I just want to also disclaim none of the

00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:01,330
code i'm using today's mine cuz then it

00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:04,270
really wouldn't work like really

00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:05,560
wouldn't work and so if you haven't used

00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,910
this I'm not going to teach you anything

00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,680
today you're just gonna see me use

00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:10,780
docker but what I'm really hoping is it

00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:13,810
inspires you to try using it because

00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:16,630
it's an amazing tool and I love using it

00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:18,850
daily and I tried it till everyone who

00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:23,950
hasn't used it before that they should

00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:27,040
get out there and try using it so this

00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:31,630
is me add Joe Cronin and I worked for

00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:33,100
cash store in Portland Maine so first

00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:38,200
off does installing dependencies ever

00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:40,420
make you feel like this I know I've been

00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,960
in a few situations this was my first

00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:45,730
Django shop working a calf star and i

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,710
think i spent about a month installing

00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:49,390
things and figuring out like oh i'm

00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:51,190
missing another system requirement i'm

00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:53,830
missing another system requirement and

00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:56,650
it was just really kind of a pain to get

00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:58,750
up and running so fear dependency hell

00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:00,700
no more because with docker all things

00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,770
are possible you don't need to install

00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,660
anything so regardless of a lot of

00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:07,120
operating system you're on it's now

00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:10,210
supported on mac OS x it's supported in

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,980
windows supported linux so really no

00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:14,140
matter what you're running it's a great

00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:17,440
tool to have and it's time for our first

00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:20,440
demo so let's see if i can fall flat on

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,700
my face really quick what I'm going to

00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,180
do is I'm actually going to start a

00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:28,990
brand new project so we're gonna do

00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:30,640
Django admin start project and can you

00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:34,720
see that on the big screen everybody is

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,700
that okay new project all right so we're

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,540
going to go in the new project I'm going

00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,360
to create a requirement

00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:49,100
the textile i'm going to put django in

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:51,860
it and save that and then i'm going to

00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:55,040
create a docker file and I'm going to

00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:57,980
use the official docker image so all I

00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:01,130
have to do is say this containers from

00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:03,070
Django on build and that's the on build

00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:07,250
version of the Django docker container

00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:09,740
from there I can just say dr. build I'm

00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:11,450
going to tag it and call it dr. demo and

00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,950
so what this is going to do is it's

00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:14,570
going to run through their doctor

00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:17,000
container that they've provided run the

00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:19,910
steps that they have and it by default

00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,260
just runs manage pie so basically it's

00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:24,050
going to do everything for me I didn't

00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:25,730
have to write any code and this project

00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:31,990
is going to hopefully run without a

00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:38,060
problem so now I'm going to run my

00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:39,500
docker demo and of course it fails

00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:43,370
because I still have something running

00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:45,230
so one second get rid of those all right

00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:47,750
so my doctor demos up and running as you

00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:49,220
can see it kind of looks like it's just

00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:51,530
hanging but that's because I didn't

00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:53,690
attach to or watch what's going on in

00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:55,700
the container whatsoever I will print

00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:58,460
out the standard out from the Django

00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:03,650
website and so what I'm going to do now

00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:07,910
is open that up and you say it worked so

00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:10,460
one of two really going to try to race

00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:14,630
through how am i doing on time ok so

00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:16,730
we're doing all right the second one is

00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:19,669
actually a little bit faster so quickly

00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:22,850
but wait there's more if you've used dr.

00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:24,530
have you use dr. compose ok so if you

00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:26,120
haven't use dr. composed basically it's

00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,890
an easy way to have an entire

00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,810
configuration file that says run this

00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:31,310
this way run that this way you can have

00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:33,500
your database your app your everything

00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:37,220
all configured pre-configured I can do

00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:39,110
all of this with one command whoa all

00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:44,660
right so we're going to go ahead and try

00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:47,300
this now and go back out and uh yeah

00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:48,630
thank you i'll just go back in with

00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:57,780
something different

00:34:48,630 --> 00:35:02,430
ah no oh good go the nerves are getting

00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:05,250
to me so dr. composing Django and I'm

00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:07,020
going around dr. compose up now I've

00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:08,580
already downloaded all of the files from

00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,470
before which is why you're not standing

00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:12,870
here for 20 minutes watching things

00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:16,590
download I figured that would probably

00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:19,620
be a good idea so its up its running

00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:22,680
we're going to go to localhost 84 this

00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:26,790
one and I have a website so this is

00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:28,560
running a database running Django it's

00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:30,900
fully functional and it took me one

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,670
command in 15 seconds per run so if

00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,900
you've never used it before I highly

00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:37,160
recommend going and taking a look and

00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,160
