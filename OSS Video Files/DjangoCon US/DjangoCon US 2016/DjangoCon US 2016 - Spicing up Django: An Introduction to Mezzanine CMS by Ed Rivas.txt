	Spicing up Django: An Introduction to Mezzanine CMS by Ed Rivas

Mezzanine CMS is a popular content-management solution for Django. With a rich set of built-in features and following Djangoâ€™s batteries-included approach, it can supercharge your new or existing apps for content-oriented sites.

In this talk we will explore the features that Mezzanine provides by default, and how they take care of many common content-management tasks (page creation and editing, maintaining a blog, WYSIWYG editors, SEO, and more).

We will also take an existing Django app and convert it into a fully integrated Mezzanine application. Youâ€™ll be surprised at how much of the work has been done for you, and how your existing Django skills will let you hit the ground running when working with Mezzanine.
