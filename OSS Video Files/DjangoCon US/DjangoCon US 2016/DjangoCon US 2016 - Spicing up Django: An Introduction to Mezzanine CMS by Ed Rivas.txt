	Spicing up Django: An Introduction to Mezzanine CMS by Ed Rivas

Mezzanine CMS is a popular content-management solution for Django. With a rich set of built-in features and following Djangoâ€™s batteries-included approach, it can supercharge your new or existing apps for content-oriented sites.

In this talk we will explore the features that Mezzanine provides by default, and how they take care of many common content-management tasks (page creation and editing, maintaining a blog, WYSIWYG editors, SEO, and more).

We will also take an existing Django app and convert it into a fully integrated Mezzanine application. Youâ€™ll be surprised at how much of the work has been done for you, and how your existing Django skills will let you hit the ground running when working with Mezzanine.

Outline:

Mezzanine tour
Basic integration of custom models
Advanced integration of custom models
Working with templates
Review
Questions (if time permits)

in this stock I want to take us in a

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,859
journey to explore the features as

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,960
Missoni provides by default and how can

00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:33,180
how they can help you with your django

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,329
knowledge to really make the most out of

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,420
it and create great content oriented

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:41,910
sites we're also going to explore

00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:44,910
creating taking an existing django app

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:49,020
and converting it to a fully integrated

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:50,520
messaging app right so i want to start

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,730
by talking a little bit about mezzanine

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,820
CMS who here knows anything about

00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:00,239
mezzanine alright so this entry is gonna

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:03,359
be needed well this here's a little bit

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,750
of period for you it was created by

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,430
Steven McDonald a guy from Australia

00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:12,770
it's been under development for seven

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:16,799
years now with comet activity every week

00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:18,860
it has more than 275 contributors you

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,689
can also find a very helpful community

00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:23,460
we have a very active mailing list and

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,310
where you can get development and

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,610
support in general it's well documented

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,290
I believe and you also have a variety of

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:36,630
third-party packages many of them

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:38,540
available to people too so now a little

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,060
bit more about the architectural

00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:43,710
philosophical side of mezzanine misson

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,590
is a very powerful consistent and

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,000
flexible content met offenses by porn it

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,220
provides a very simple yet highly

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,549
extensible architecture that encourages

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,530
diving in and hacking on the code you

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,630
you'll get the same batteries included

00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,060
approach as django but applied to

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,670
content

00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:04,460
you get a blog for free hierarchical

00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,710
page navigation schedule publishing of

00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,229
your pages multi-tenancy support for

00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:11,750
multiple sites and there's a huge list

00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,670
of features that are there for you

00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,080
messaging also inherits a bunch of

00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,569
gendell's fine-grained permission

00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,940
controls security effects best practices

00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:21,950
of course and you'll be able to leverage

00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,080
much of the goodies and things that you

00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:27,890
already know about Django in your

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,560
messaging application but maybe the most

00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,330
important thing about messaging is it's

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,610
just general this it's right there in

00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:37,370
the docs if you go check them there's a

00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:39,440
quote that says messin is just Django so

00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:42,640
everything you know about writing models

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:46,400
about writing abuse about writing

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,170
templates will be a good for you you'll

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,450
be able to hit the ground running if you

00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:54,080
know at least a little bit of juggle

00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:58,280
already alright so let's get started now

00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,050
and convert a small application well

00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,780
this is started selling mezzanine and

00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:05,900
then convert an application to work with

00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:08,870
it so as you can see as any other piping

00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,250
package you can install it via PIP it

00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:13,700
will download all the dependencies

00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:16,160
including Django then you can run this

00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,510
messaging project comment which don't

00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,900
get scared just a wrapper around

00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:24,530
Django's Django project coming and it

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:27,170
will give you the started project layout

00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:29,000
or project template with some of the

00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:31,190
settings and URL configuration already

00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,890
filled in for you but other than that is

00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:37,130
just a regular Django project then after

00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:39,410
that you run create database grade DB

00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:43,420
which the same thing it's just a wrapper

00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:46,400
around migrate from Django you only

00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:49,250
needed to get that to create a default

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,350
user a super user and if you want you

00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,269
can also install some demo content for

00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:55,519
you to get started quickly and after

00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:59,329
that run server which is just a standard

00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,130
a genuine coming up so now we open your

00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:03,440
browser and open your localhost and this

00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:05,810
is what you get out of the box you have

00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,970
a complete a nested pastry

00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,280
you've got insight search you've got a

00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,560
basic but stripped down

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,270
but you've got a blog and many many

00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,739
other things just for free just for

00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:19,840
installing messin in via pit

00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:21,910
so let's write our own application or

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,770
convert one a standard Django

00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:30,340
application to better integrate it with

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:31,960
messaging so I'm gonna use the polis

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,060
application because I think it's well

00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,000
known if you have ever completed the

00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:39,220
Django tutorial it's just a very simple

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,169
application I like it because will you

00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,390
let us play with two models that both

00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:46,030
model you remember he just has a

00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:48,160
question from and then it has the

00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:51,160
choices which are an inline model that

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,950
you'll be able to give options to answer

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,660
the question you're following about this

00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:59,290
is editor will be on the admin side

00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:02,380
users register the admin class it has a

00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,780
list and a detailed view to and it will

00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,760
handle form input like Bodie this is

00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:10,500
what the the poll application does by

00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:13,479
default when you complete the tutorials

00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,400
so how do you install an application in

00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:18,220
messaging well it's just like a any

00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,990
general project you are you add your app

00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,630
to the installed apps and settings you

00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:25,860
are up your URL configuration and

00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:29,320
finally you run migrations if any and

00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,210
you're up and running of course if your

00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,710
app is more complex and you need to

00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,140
define custom middleware you need to

00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,539
define context processors or anything

00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:42,280
like that you can do it it's just like

00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:44,590
installing anything in general so right

00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,020
after doing that and adding the port

00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:49,240
application as it came from the tutorial

00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,880
directly into the messaging project this

00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,580
is what you get mezzanine uses Brackley

00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,350
as the admin interface but other than

00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,990
that you don't need any changes in your

00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:02,350
admin class or your model definition or

00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:05,560
anything to get this working you get the

00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:07,570
regular model admin and also the in

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,240
lines just as you defined them in the

00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:12,370
regular application and the public

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,210
facing views also work as you would

00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,550
expect it this is the view that

00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:18,590
that comes through the poll app again

00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,210
you just wire the URL configuration and

00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,630
you'll get this working out of the box

00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:25,819
without any changes so let's spice it up

00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,560
a little bit let's say that some new

00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:29,410
requirements come in and you want to

00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,360
change the behavior of the application

00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:34,639
so we can do that well let's define

00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,530
those requirements let's say we want to

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,770
publish in workflow and what do I mean

00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:42,199
with a publishing workflow that we want

00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:44,120
some application some polls to be able

00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:46,880
to be set on draft for example if our

00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,320
admin users they're creating a new poll

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,039
but they don't want to publish it right

00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:54,199
away they can save it in the adamant

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:56,750
save it as draft and it will not be

00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:58,880
available in the public side so they can

00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,259
come back and work in it later we also

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,720
want them to be able to schedule

00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:05,930
publishing why don't you be able to say

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,199
okay this poll is gonna be live gonna go

00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:12,229
live in next week Monday midnight and we

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,919
also can set expiration dates and want

00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:19,130
to say okay this poll is going to expire

00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:20,810
next Friday at the end of the day we

00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,759
also want the most recent polls to

00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,750
appear first so we want to have some way

00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,090
to control

00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,250
whichever which poll was published

00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,830
recently right which is a common

00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:33,620
requirement we also want to use slots

00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:36,860
instead of primary keys in the URL so

00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:39,590
our URL or SEO and readability purposes

00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:43,880
maybe we don't want to have you know my

00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:47,680
side comm / whole slash 43 when we can

00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:50,719
have a poll / my awesome poll you know

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,240
more shareable more readable and we also

00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:55,759
want the choices to be sortable and our

00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,259
admin users let's say they have the

00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,509
choices that they just don't want to

00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:02,120
sort them as they add them maybe they

00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:03,680
want to change the sorting after that so

00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,229
how are we gonna do that with mesammy

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,690
well well this is the original models

00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:11,979
original polls model if you can you very

00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:14,870
easy just a single field the question

00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:17,840
which is just a text from for users to

00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:20,000
insert the question now the displayable

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,339
model this is one of the base models

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,190
that ships with method in and is the one

00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:25,650
that you're going to be

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:27,360
inheriting a lot it's a base where I'll

00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:29,490
call it facing content pieces in

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,880
mezzanine this is what's going to add

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:34,740
the drafts publish its status to our

00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,539
model instances because these is the

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,030
same is going to allow you for schedule

00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:41,370
publishing it can auto generate Slavs

00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,930
from your child and just grate them

00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,120
automatically though you can override

00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:47,790
these locks if you want to craft them

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,500
yourself and it comes with some helper

00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:54,120
adenine classes and manager for that

00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,040
you're gonna get some fields by the pole

00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,960
you're gonna get a title field you're

00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,600
gonna get a meta title field if you want

00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:04,860
to change how the the piece of content

00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:06,360
appears in the browser title bar you're

00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,610
gonna get dis a slug field which is

00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,680
going to be which can be auto-generated

00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,330
or you can customize it you also get a

00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,750
description in case you want to

00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:18,000
automatically populate the browser meta

00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,650
description with the description from

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,440
your content or the content from your

00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:24,390
page you also get a publish date which

00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,850
is going to be a starting to ascender

00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:28,800
Django day time object which you can

00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,090
manipulate later you also get the status

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,790
where you're gonna be able to check

00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:35,460
whether a piece of content is published

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,950
or a set a strap and a bunch more which

00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:39,750
are not important right now

00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:41,930
so we're gonna inherit from this model

00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:45,990
would just import it from mezzanine and

00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:48,090
yeah we just cross it and that's it we

00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:51,060
actually can get rid of the question

00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:53,100
from because the model is gonna define

00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,980
its own title field and that's what

00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,570
we're gonna use for the question and

00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,430
yeah just inherit from it of course in

00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:02,100
case you need to add more fields you can

00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:04,680
do it normally create your own Django

00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,750
fields and customize if we want to say

00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,960
oh it's both gonna have a picture for

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:12,990
example okay a file field right there

00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:15,390
and this the original admin you can see

00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,580
we have to define our field we want you

00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:20,130
to find the in lines to display the

00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,830
choices want to define who's going to be

00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:26,390
displayed in the list view and we want

00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:28,370
to define who is gonna be

00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:30,580
from the admin so this is the original

00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:35,030
one that came from the post application

00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:36,320
and this I would look and we're going to

00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,960
use now the displayable

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,570
admin class on that from that and this

00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:44,420
is the same we're just gonna inherit

00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:46,250
from messaging and just the only change

00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:48,050
we need to do is tell it which Eli's do

00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:50,900
want to use right the choices little

00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:52,550
choices behind it after it we just need

00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,770
to specify that because we will see how

00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:57,980
it this will change the admin interface

00:10:54,770 --> 00:11:01,400
for us so this is the news I mean you

00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:03,740
get and you can see you get well the

00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,380
title that's our old question from we

00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:08,570
use that now this love will be generated

00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,790
from that and automatically you can use

00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:13,580
it in your muse for to retrieve the

00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:16,250
object you also get the draft and

00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:20,150
publish toggle for your users to peek if

00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:22,490
they want the the content to be tracked

00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:25,700
republished you can set the published

00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:28,190
from and expires on dates to define when

00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:31,430
should something be available in the

00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:33,170
public site or not and in the metadata

00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:36,860
panel which this one is a collapsible

00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:38,990
panel it will allow you to tweak the

00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,270
gender generate this love add meta

00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:43,160
keywords add a description and choose if

00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:48,770
you want to include this page in your

00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:51,140
site sitemap and in the least view we're

00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:52,610
gonna get a full search on the title of

00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,920
the post we're gonna get a date

00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:58,760
hierarchy on the publish date you're

00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,560
gonna be able to filter by status here

00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:05,360
you're going to be able to switch out

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:08,060
the publish status of the pieces of the

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,740
polls right from the lease view so all

00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,320
of these we just got from me hurting

00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:17,240
from messiness models and messing in

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:21,290
admin classes so now how about the view

00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,450
if we if we know that our polls are

00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:24,860
going to be some are going to be draft

00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:27,920
and some are going to be published you

00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:30,500
of course only want users to be able to

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,980
see the publish ones we simply have to

00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:36,230
use the publish manager basically what

00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,690
you have to do and this is a very simple

00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:41,560
class-based view the

00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:44,170
again shipped with the post application

00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,180
we the only thing you want to do is when

00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:48,220
you're getting your query set either on

00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:51,310
a class-based view or that function

00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:53,920
based one instead of doing objects dot

00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:56,170
all you do objects that's published and

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,870
with that with the manager that comes

00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,640
from ethane you already are going to

00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,040
return only the published one so you

00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,050
have to worry that your public facing

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,270
users your public site users are going

00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:09,760
to see content that doesn't meant for

00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:11,950
them to to see and after that you can do

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:16,810
the order by the publish date you get

00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:20,500
the most recent post first yeah so this

00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:23,680
is what the you ends up looking like you

00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,450
get to the poles and then you have them

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:30,400
sorted by how recently where they're

00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:35,620
published the next thing is what we were

00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:37,900
talking about being able to sort the the

00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,670
little in lines the little choices like

00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,830
the one we don't want to have the

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:44,080
choices appear as they were added maybe

00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:46,600
they use the atom users wanted to have

00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,280
you know I want this one on top let's

00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,050
move this one to the bottom so we're

00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,150
going to use the orderable model which

00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:54,280
also ships with mezzanine

00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:56,410
it's ideal for suitable in lines it

00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,780
comes in both it's stacked in tabular

00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:02,230
varieties you can drag and drop sort

00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:03,880
with it and it will also support dynamic

00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:06,100
creation for more inline form so you

00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,690
don't have to define the extra how many

00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,760
extra in lines you want to show to the

00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:11,530
user they can just keep creating them

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,390
and populate it in of course you can

00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:17,560
limit that with the standard Django

00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:18,910
admin classes so it's the same here

00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,730
we're going to we're gonna add our

00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:24,640
choice model we're going to inherit from

00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:27,460
orderable and you just set a foreign key

00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:30,850
to our old old model said the choice

00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:33,790
text and set the integer field for to

00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:37,270
the store how many votes has each choice

00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:40,009
got and in the animated class we only

00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:42,850
hear it from tabular dynamic in line

00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:45,139
there's also this tacit priority and

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,240
this is what you get you get your

00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:50,509
choices and you get those little handles

00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,639
which you can sort manage with what

00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:55,430
users can use their mouths to sort them

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,889
you know they can use any arbitrary

00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:00,800
ordering they want and they also get the

00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:02,809
little add another button which will let

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,459
them create as many English as they one

00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:09,079
they don't have to do three at a time or

00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:11,660
anything like that and lastly well some

00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:14,870
templates I'm just gonna go quickly over

00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,610
this because we don't have much time but

00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:19,699
this is it this is the template that the

00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:22,819
Polish application came with right not

00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:24,709
very pretty but you know you can write

00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:27,829
any CSS you want it gets you all that

00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:31,910
puts ability but if we go ahead and edit

00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:33,230
it to extend some of the of the basic

00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:35,930
templates that come with messaging

00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:38,870
already if you for example extend the

00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:41,089
base HTML template use the title block

00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:45,769
and you put all your main content in

00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:48,139
this main block this is what you get you

00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:51,500
get the you get it integrated into the

00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:52,670
bootstrap theme now here I know you

00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,709
might have different opinions on

00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,660
bootstrap and everything the point here

00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:59,269
is not to make you use bootstrap I don't

00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:01,399
want you to think that oh my sanity's

00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:03,709
bootstrap then I cannot do anything out

00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:05,509
of it it's just there as a default to

00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:07,490
get you up and running quickly you want

00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:09,680
to show a prototype quickly you want to

00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:12,439
use a free bootstrap theme this is for

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,540
you then you only have to extend best

00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:16,129
mezzanine templates and use the right

00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:21,410
blocks and you can get something like

00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:23,059
this very quickly so let's review what

00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:25,490
we did the step that we followed to

00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:27,620
convert a regular Django application

00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:31,759
into your regular into a fully

00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:33,589
integrated messenger app so in the

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,329
models that your main models are going

00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:37,490
to be able to you're going to want to

00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:40,069
evaluate if you want to inherit from

00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:41,959
displayable to get you the all the

00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:44,889
public-facing goodies that we reviewed

00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:47,480
before the auto-generated aslaug the

00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:49,950
publish status this kettle publishing

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,650
we're eating lines are going to probably

00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:54,450
I want to inherit from orderable to get

00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:57,480
that drag-and-drop ordering on your

00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:59,840
models when you're making queries in

00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,580
your database in your views or whatever

00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,740
you want to use objects uh published

00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:07,860
instead of objects that all to make sure

00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,699
that schedule publishing is working as

00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,280
expected

00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:15,089
and then for templates you want to

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:17,040
extend mezzanine blocks you want to use

00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:19,440
the mezzanine included templates if you

00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:21,420
want to use bootstrap on your site and

00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:25,620
just get that site up and running

00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:27,440
quickly now there's a whole bunch of

00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:31,350
things that I haven't even thought

00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:33,900
talked about here messaging supports

00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:36,480
custom page types so users can you can

00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:39,630
create custom pages that your users can

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,510
use when creating the page 3 in

00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:44,550
mezzanine you also have a complete file

00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:47,100
manager in your server that means users

00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:48,930
can upload and manage their files

00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,390
instead of just having that little form

00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:53,280
file input in your forms and your admin

00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:56,910
you can have one that lets them browse

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:59,760
inside the media that already exists in

00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:01,410
the site and it's much more easier to

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,050
work like that

00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:06,090
Metheny also ships with a series of

00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:08,880
fabric scripts that you can use to

00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:12,690
automate deployments so if you get a $5

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:15,270
VPS from any web hosting provider online

00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:18,180
and get up and running very easily even

00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:20,850
if you haven't done any general

00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,680
deployments before it also has pace

00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,900
processors that will let you it's like

00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:27,510
writing views but for your custom pages

00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,490
and we'll let you inject context context

00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:32,190
into the template whatever you need it

00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:34,650
it also has an e-commerce module where

00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:37,080
you're gonna be able to integrate a

00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:40,410
shopping cart and shopping categories

00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:42,540
and prices and variations it also has a

00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,980
WYSIWYG editor which is swappable in

00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,890
case you don't like the default you can

00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:50,550
define very easily your own custom class

00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:52,980
and include your media to be used

00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:55,530
instead of the default it also has user

00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:58,620
editable settings which will allow your

00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:59,850
users for me to stop very simple like I

00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,820
don't know

00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,590
what's your your sites Facebook or

00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,879
Twitter you're out and you just want to

00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,369
type that in you don't want that in

00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:11,519
version control you want that for them

00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:13,679
to edit it in the admin and it's easier

00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:18,509
and you can use it whatever you want in

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:20,249
the backend or in your templates so

00:19:18,509 --> 00:19:22,049
there's a little bit more you can read

00:19:20,249 --> 00:19:27,080
it I mean what can you do after this

00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:29,039
stop destiny has a page in their

00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,070
documentation that's called their

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:34,019
content architecture and I think it's

00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:37,289
one of the most important pages it goes

00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:40,049
into detail of what I've explained here

00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:41,639
what is this playable model what are you

00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:45,179
supposed to do with it it also has

00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:49,080
another strategy for creating custom

00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:50,580
page type which is out of the scope of

00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,590
this stuff but you should read that

00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,359
there's a couple of community blocks and

00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:57,349
you're going to be able to to read to

00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:59,580
that's very good on some specific

00:19:57,349 --> 00:20:02,489
battle-tested parents to develop

00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,559
messaging applications and there's also

00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:07,220
the messaging blog application as I told

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:10,649
you out of the box you're gonna get a

00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:13,289
blog for your site this love application

00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:15,929
is that I think it's a great case study

00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:18,119
of a nontrivial app developed for

00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:20,399
messaging because it has a good deal

00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:23,190
abuse it has much more complex models it

00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:25,499
has its own template tags so it's a good

00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:28,649
way to see how you're gonna create a

00:20:25,499 --> 00:20:30,809
more robust complex application that is

00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:32,519
integrated with messaging and there's no

00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:35,720
links there but I'm gonna share the

00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:40,379
dislike later and they will have links

00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:43,200
so thank you I left some the this live

00:20:40,379 --> 00:20:46,979
you're out there and my and there's a

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,619
reco for this oh I only went through

00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:51,720
here which you can use to better

00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:54,529
understand how to convert your django

00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,529
app to the mezzanine

00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:07,040
hey it's nice to understand how

00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:09,140
mursaleen works I just have a curious

00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:12,380
question that since Muslim is talking

00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:14,150
more about the content right so how what

00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:17,150
is this a level of support that it can

00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:21,110
provide for a no sequel type data that's

00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:23,810
flowing from django to this I've seen a

00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:26,270
branch for Django that and Django

00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:29,720
started developing a no sequel support

00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:31,760
so how this framework adapts that on

00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,220
that level I'll say it's the same as

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:37,790
Django I mean if you can get a non

00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:40,940
relational database working with Django

00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:44,030
with the ORM just was messing users with

00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:47,030
the ORM and if you can fake that so to

00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:48,530
speak we should work I haven't really

00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:50,720
done it and messing doesn't provide

00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:53,060
anything specific for it okay but it's

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,240
just whatever works with Django we're

00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:59,800
working with method in that respect

00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,800
thank you anyone else have a question

00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:04,240
