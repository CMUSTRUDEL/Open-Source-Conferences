Django Security Talk Notes

Introduction
Philip James, how long Iâ€™ve worked with Python and Django, background at EB
Introduction to the story, and the characters
Safe-ish: Talk about Djangoâ€™s Security Model and how it tries to provide sane defaults for developers
Run-through of the parts of the django security model

XSS (brief definition)

Django escapes characters by default

How?

How do you turn it off? Mark Safe, | n, safe

CSRF (brief definition)

Django has middleware that checks POST requests for a token

How?

Token is stored in cookie, also

Could be better? Make cookie httponly

Side-effect: harder to JS. Also, only an issue if youâ€™re already owned, so maybe not an issue?

How to get around it? csrf_exempt

SQLi (brief definition)

Djangoâ€™s ORM makes clean sql, (even when given bad data?)

How?

How to get around it: extra()/RawSQL()

Clickjacking protection (brief definition)

Django has middleware that sets headers browsers are supposed to respect

Which browsers? https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/clickjacking/#limitations

How to get around it: xframe_options_exempt, xframe_options_deny, xframe_options_sameorigin

HTTPS

This one is less "out of the box" than the others, so wonâ€™t be talked about here.
Host Header Validation (brief definition)

Django verifies against allowed hosts in settings

How? get_host()

Session security

What are django sessions?

Cookie-based by design

How can we make this better?

Overall: Vigilance. Be aware of uses of this within your product

XSS, CSRF, SQLi, Clickjacking: Have them all enabled, write rules to check for "escape-hatch" functions

HTTPS:

Use it!

Set the correct settings

SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT: How does it work?
