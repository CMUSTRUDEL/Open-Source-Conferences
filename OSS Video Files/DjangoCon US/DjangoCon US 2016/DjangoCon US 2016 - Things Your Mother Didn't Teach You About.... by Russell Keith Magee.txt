	Things Your Mother Didn't Teach You About Sharing Your Toys by Russell Keith Magee

In this talk, Russell Keith-Magee will bring the experience born of 25+ years as a software developer, 10 years as a Django core developer, 5 years as DSF President, and 5 years as a business owner to expose you to some topics that every software developer should know, but often aren't covered as part of formal training. This includes legal topics such as copyrights, licensing, and trademarks, the role played by codes of conduct, and some of the non-code skills that are important for successful projects, and essential for successful entrepreneurship.
