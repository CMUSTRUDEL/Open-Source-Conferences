Description: 
	Things Your Mother Didn't Teach You About Sharing Your Toys by Russell Keith Magee

In this talk, Russell Keith-Magee will bring the experience born of 25+ years as a software developer, 10 years as a Django core developer, 5 years as DSF President, and 5 years as a business owner to expose you to some topics that every software developer should know, but often aren't covered as part of formal training. This includes legal topics such as copyrights, licensing, and trademarks, the role played by codes of conduct, and some of the non-code skills that are important for successful projects, and essential for successful entrepreneurship.

come on

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,770
hey well thank you very much Adrian and

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,240
hello Philadelphia a little quick heads

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,199
up towards the end of this talk I am

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,509
going to discuss a couple of issues

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,770
around depression and burnout so as a

00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:27,630
trigger warning if you need to take some

00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,509
steps for self-care be advised I'll flag

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,829
this again before I start that section

00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:33,329
as Adrienne said my name is Russell

00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:34,739
Keith McGee I've been around the Django

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:36,570
community for a long time including

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,850
serving on the technical bored being a

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,170
member of the core team Django is an

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,789
open source project but it's not the

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,649
only open source project I'm associated

00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:45,120
with these days I'm spending most of my

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,700
time working on the beware project

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,860
beware is an open-source collection of

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,260
tools and libraries for creating native

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,600
user interfaces in Python for desktop

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,390
but also for iOS and Android and for

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,260
single page web apps and I've been so

00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,970
see ated with a bunch of other

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,770
open-source projects as a user as a

00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,409
contributor as a project maintainer over

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,939
the years now if your parents were

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,590
anything like mine they drilled into you

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,090
at a very young age that it's important

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,219
to share your choice with the other

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,170
children and it's this sharing

00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:15,240
philosophy that is at the core of open

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,619
source yes I could tinker away with my

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,149
own thing and build something useful and

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,979
lock it away so that nobody else could

00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:21,679
see it but if I share what I know

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,479
everyone gets richer for the experience

00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:26,670
others can see how my toys work others

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,369
can take my toys and use them and I can

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,200
use their toys to do the same and if we

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:32,579
work together we can combine forces and

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,179
build something truly magnificent

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,829
together however as we grow up we

00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:40,889
discover that it isn't quite as simple

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,450
as just share we can certainly aspire to

00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:43,979
this as a philosophy and but you have to

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,509
be proactive you have to set up the

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,569
conditions that make sharing both

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:50,219
possible and attractive and there are

00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:52,020
people out there who weren't taught to

00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:54,659
play by their parents to play well with

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,979
others and so while sharing is a good

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,349
philosophy to maintain it's also

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,179
necessary to protect yourself SI vis

00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:02,249
pacem para bellum if you want peace

00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:03,990
prepare for war because when some

00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:05,700
nefarious individual has stolen your

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,520
toys it's the worst possible time to

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,860
discover that you're not protected what

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,849
I'm presenting here is a redux of the

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,040
things that I've picked up in my

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:15,930
20-something year as a career as a

00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,489
software engineer preceded by another

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,319
ten years as a software enthusiast and

00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:21,599
in particular from the experience I

00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:24,300
gained from my role as being president

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,550
of the Django software foundation the

00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,740
role of the DSF was and is to be the

00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,200
coordinating entity

00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,060
the Django project DSF is charged with

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,670
ensuring that the Django as a project

00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,020
can continue to exist this means

00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,850
establishing the conditions that are

00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,500
labeled Jago to thrive and providing the

00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:42,740
big stick of protection for the projects

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:44,120
assets okay so let's take a look at a

00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,800
couple of areas where you need to have

00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,510
your wits about you if you are going to

00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,120
be sharing your toys with others start

00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:52,600
with copyright what is copyright

00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,130
copyright is the right created in law

00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,200
granting a creator of an original work

00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:59,810
the exclusive rights to decide how that

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,660
work is used and distributed copyright

00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:04,610
is granted immediately and by default to

00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,950
the person who creates the piece of work

00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,930
when they create it if you want a song

00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:11,120
write a book write some software you are

00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,860
the creator of that work and you have

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,340
the right to decide how that creation

00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:18,140
will be used a copyright using the word

00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,610
as a noun there is property its

00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,590
intellectual property it's something

00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:24,080
that can be bought and sold it can only

00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,700
be owned by a single legal entity at any

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,290
given time and as I say entity there

00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,080
because it can be a company that owns it

00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:32,270
if you have a copyright and if I have a

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,550
copyright and I sell it to you you now

00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:37,040
own it you have the copyright for that

00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,930
work copyright isn't granted

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,390
indefinitely it's granted for a period

00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,190
of time in theory it eventually expires

00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,440
and when it does the work reverse to the

00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,670
public domain I say in theory because

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,440
copyright durations keep getting is

00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,940
standard but in theory all work will

00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,390
eventually revert to the public domain

00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,530
if you've got a tangible physical piece

00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:57,170
of property there are obvious

00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:59,150
limitations to use this is my phone and

00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,650
if you take it without permission you're

00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,810
stealing it and that's a criminal act

00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,150
but i can give you commission i can

00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,890
license you to use my phone and then it

00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,350
isn't a criminal act for you to use my

00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:11,450
phone I can set constraints on your use

00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:14,350
I might ask you not to tweet pooping

00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:17,150
while you have access to my phone and

00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:19,430
lending you my phone doesn't inherently

00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:21,350
give you any property rights over my

00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,300
phone you can't lend my phone to someone

00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,160
else unless I say you can it's still my

00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,670
property you're just using it under

00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,980
license however i can give you or sell

00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:32,990
you my phone i can transfer my property

00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,790
right to you but it makes a big

00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,620
difference whether i'm giving you my

00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:40,320
phone or licensing you my phone

00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,240
a piece of software is intellectual

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,190
property the copyright for a piece of

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,979
software is owned by someone by default

00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:49,169
the Creator if you want to use a piece

00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:51,990
of software you have to either be given

00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:54,960
ownership given the copyright or granted

00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:58,460
a license to use that work and it makes

00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,050
a very big difference which one you get

00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,690
traditionally copyright was granted to

00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,699
give creators exclusivity to sell copies

00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,410
of their work the expectation was that

00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:09,960
people would license copies of their

00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:11,250
work in exchange for payment but in the

00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,740
early 80s the Free Software Foundation

00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:16,080
engineered a very clever legal hack they

00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,000
wrote a software license that rather

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,039
than rather than defending the rights of

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,580
the Creator defended the rights of the

00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:24,960
user and the results was copyleft

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,570
copyleft if you've heard that term is

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,240
not a replacement for copyright it's a

00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:33,060
clever legal hack that uses copyright

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,300
law to enforce the exact opposite of

00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,970
what copyright was intended to provide

00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:43,169
without copyright law copyleft wouldn't

00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:48,930
exist so time for a pop quiz who owns

00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:50,760
Django's copyright if you answer the DSF

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,370
you are only partially correct and by a

00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:56,880
line of code count you're wrong Django's

00:05:53,370 --> 00:06:00,090
copyright is held primarily by its

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,650
individual contributors that's you if

00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,940
you contributed code there is a small

00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,950
amount of code that was written as I

00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,840
work for hire for the DSF and some of

00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:08,550
the initial code was transferred to the

00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,470
ownership of the DSF from the

00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,419
journal-world when the the DSF was set

00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,860
up but if you haven't received a

00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:15,330
paycheck from the DSF or the

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,849
journal-world at some point in your life

00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:22,010
and you have code in Django's codebase

00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:25,500
you still own the copyright to that code

00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:29,130
that means that DSF doesn't hold the

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:32,010
copyright for all of django therefore

00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:35,610
the DSF needs a license to distribute

00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:37,169
the code it doesn't own this is what

00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:40,080
Django has contributor license

00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:42,389
agreements a CLA is a license that a

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,910
creator grants to another project that

00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:46,919
enables that project to distribute their

00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:49,050
code contribution under the same license

00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:51,180
as the rest of the project it's that

00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:54,840
license that allows the DSF

00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:56,850
to license Jango as a whole so if you

00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,800
have contributed to django make sure you

00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:01,169
have signed a CLA and if you work for

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,900
someone else make sure they have signed

00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:05,580
a corporate CLA saying that yeah they

00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,780
are allowing your contributions to be

00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:11,639
used by Jango a contributor license

00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,169
agreement isn't the only way to address

00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,120
the licensing issue it's the way that

00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:16,500
the Django project currently uses a much

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,789
more lightweight mechanism is something

00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,979
called a developer's certificate of

00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:22,380
origin a dco is the mechanism used by

00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:24,509
the Linux kernel by Daka the beware

00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,400
project and a number of others the DCO

00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:28,199
is a statement that's made by the

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,090
contributor that verifies that they

00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,710
wrote the code that the contributor has

00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,270
the right to license it and that you're

00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:35,940
willing to grant the project a license

00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:37,949
to redistribute it all that's required

00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,449
to acknowledge DCO is actually a single

00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:41,820
line of text and a git commit message

00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:43,169
you put signed off by your name your

00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,580
email address where that name and email

00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:48,030
address matches your your get

00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,560
credentials and it's done when it's

00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,150
merged in that becomes the get history

00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,160
because the git commit message is part

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,630
of the hash therefore can't be modified

00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,510
and we've got a permanent proof that you

00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,800
actually sign this piece of code and so

00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,449
may things easy get even gives you a

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,120
command to do this for you if you pass

00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:04,800
in the minus s flag when you commit get

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,430
will add that sign offline for you based

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:11,130
upon your get credentials a third option

00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:12,270
is to transfer ownership entirely now

00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,460
this is obviously the heavy-handed

00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:16,889
approach when you submit your patch you

00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:19,800
sign over all your property rights to

00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:22,139
that patch however some projects do

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,849
require this most notably the ganool the

00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:25,680
korg a new tools because they have a

00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:28,050
political goal they want to ensure that

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,360
potentially they could go to court and

00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,409
defend the GPL and they don't want to

00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,969
get thrown out of court on the

00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:34,680
technicality that they don't own the

00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:36,839
copyright that there for the code that's

00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,060
being licensed so they require you to

00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,060
give them ownership of the code and you

00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,860
lose all your or your property rights

00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:45,839
there's a more common form of ownership

00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,760
transfer though that's when software is

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,680
developed as they work for hire if your

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,149
employer pays you to develop a piece of

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,250
code you've probably signed an

00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:56,610
employment agreement that says your

00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:58,890
employer owns your creative work but not

00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,930
always and not necessarily by default

00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,910
check your employment agreement check

00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,620
your local legal jurisdiction check

00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,380
twice if you're a freelancer

00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,150
contractor because if you're if you're

00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,820
writing code for living it's really

00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,920
important to know whether you own the

00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,780
copyright or your employer owns the

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,880
copyright because if the employer your

00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,010
employer owns the copyright you cannot

00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,110
take that code that you've written and

00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:24,600
use it in your next project for your

00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:28,800
next customer unless you've been granted

00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,360
a license to do so so assuming you are

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,640
the copyright holder for a project or at

00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,140
least a license or contributions how do

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,910
you grant a license to the your end

00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,200
users well there's a number of ways to

00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,790
do it but the easiest way the way that

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,320
sort of becoming expected practice in

00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,480
the github era is you put a single

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,150
license file in the root of your code

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,560
tree just contains the contents of the

00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,170
legal agreement that you're asking users

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,970
to comply to and how do the users except

00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,560
that license by using the code the

00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,270
license will usually have text to the

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,610
effect of by using this code the user

00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:58,200
agrees to blah blah blah there's no need

00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,610
to sign anything for that license to

00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,550
come into effect it's it comes into

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:04,440
effect through use but what lessons

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,510
should you grant well that's entirely up

00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,030
to you after all it's your creation it's

00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:10,860
your copyright but if you're managing an

00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:13,320
open source project allow me to offer

00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,540
some advice first off use one of the

00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,570
well-known licenses the Open Source

00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:21,300
Initiative recognizes 78 different

00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:23,460
open-source licenses as being compliant

00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,230
with open-source guidelines but even

00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,180
they suggest that you stick to one of

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,680
the well-known ones I don't even

00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,360
remotely have enough time to dig into

00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,310
each of these licenses in detail there

00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,830
are plenty of other videos and radicals

00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:36,510
and resources that analyze what each of

00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:39,120
these provide and will help you pick the

00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:41,220
best license but before you pick a

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,650
license consider what it is you're

00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:46,290
trying to achieve what do you want to be

00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:47,880
able to use your software for who do you

00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:50,070
want to be able to use your software are

00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,660
there particular uses or users that

00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,880
you're trying to encourage or prevent

00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:56,010
are there particular threats to your

00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,110
project that you perceive what will be

00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:00,030
the impact of competing projects or

00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,970
competing implementations or hostile

00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:04,470
Forks don't just pick one pick one

00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:08,610
that's going to help you achieve your

00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:10,440
goals for your project your choice of

00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,390
license is also a signal about how you

00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,620
perceive your project and its

00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,690
interaction with other pieces in the

00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,310
software environment that's used in to

00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:18,329
that end it's worth looking at the

00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,939
social signals York

00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:23,069
munity ascending Django is for example a

00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:24,779
bsd heavy community you're totally free

00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:26,249
to use another license if you want but

00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:28,110
if you release a Django project under

00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:30,179
the terms of the BSD license then you're

00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:33,449
signaling that you're broadly aligned

00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:35,459
with community norms also keep in mind

00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:37,889
what it is that you're writing the terms

00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:40,290
of the GPL use lots of specific software

00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:42,119
specific terminology those terms may not

00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:44,009
provide the best protection for your

00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:46,470
work maybe you should choose a different

00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:48,329
option and you can use different

00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,949
licenses for different pieces of your

00:11:48,329 --> 00:11:51,629
project now the code under bsd

00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:53,399
documentation of the creative commons

00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:55,350
for example as long as it's clearly

00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:59,699
communicated what license applies where

00:11:55,350 --> 00:12:02,579
you set you can if you choose offer

00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:04,619
multiple licenses remember a license is

00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:06,899
an agreement between a license or and a

00:12:04,619 --> 00:12:09,779
licensee agreeing the conditions of use

00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:11,910
you can offer me multiple sets of terms

00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:14,429
that I might wish to accept I only have

00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:16,980
to accept one in order to use the piece

00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:18,869
of code if you have competing interests

00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,639
for example commercial users and

00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:22,529
open-source community users you might

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,860
want to offer two different licenses on

00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:28,230
two different sets of terms the only

00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,869
thing you can't do is not provide a

00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:32,100
license if you don't provide a license

00:12:30,869 --> 00:12:33,809
for your code if you don't have a

00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,759
license file in your in your route

00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:37,199
direct route of your repository or some

00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,339
other indications somewhere in your code

00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:41,399
of what license the code is available

00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:43,549
and under the default terms allocated by

00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:46,679
copyright law are all rights reserved

00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:49,529
even if you don't say that that means

00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:52,259
that nobody can legally use your coat

00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:54,989
and if you see code with no clearly

00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:59,369
offered license you cannot legally use

00:12:54,989 --> 00:13:01,589
it this even applies to code snippets it

00:12:59,369 --> 00:13:04,739
doesn't matter how long that snippet is

00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:07,739
it's still a creative work the owner the

00:13:04,739 --> 00:13:11,999
author still owns the copyright so you

00:13:07,739 --> 00:13:13,350
need a license to use that snippet sites

00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:14,699
like stackoverflow get around this

00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,439
through a user agreement part of your

00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:18,540
agreement is a user stack overflow is

00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:20,309
that all your contributions are licensed

00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,799
under a creative commons by share alike

00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:24,540
with attribution you agreed to this when

00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,999
you created your stack overflow account

00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:28,499
and so through having accepted that

00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:30,269
agreement you can use any snippet on

00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:31,650
stack overflow as long as you've got an

00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:33,400
account

00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,660
but what if you want to publish a

00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,800
snippet somewhere other than Stack

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,480
Overflow you don't want to manage a

00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,500
license but as a creator you also can't

00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,880
just throw up your hands in the air and

00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,370
say we're giving this away the public

00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:45,100
domain as the creator of a work in some

00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:47,560
jurisdictions certain rights cannot be

00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,060
transferred issues of copyright are

00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,220
closely a turned with a concept known as

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,620
moral rights rights that are considered

00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:56,140
innate to the human experience the

00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:58,150
problem is that moral rights are very

00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,060
jurisdiction dependent moral rights

00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:03,490
recognized by European and in particular

00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:06,280
German courts are much stronger than the

00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,080
moral rights recognized by US courts so

00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,850
if you declare that you've released your

00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,520
code into the public domain that is

00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,830
actually illegal in Germany German

00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,630
courts won't recognize that transfer of

00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:18,100
ownership to the public domain any more

00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:21,400
than they'd recognize a legal agreement

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:23,050
to sell yourself into slavery your moral

00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,630
right to fair compensation for your

00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:28,300
creative work is a wall right that is

00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,800
considered unalienable and so your work

00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,960
reverts to its default license all

00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:35,590
rights reserved and then Germans can't

00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:37,750
use your coat the other thing you

00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:40,150
shouldn't do don't write your own

00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,890
license and that includes taking a

00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:44,290
well-known license and adding some

00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:45,910
custom term the common licenses and

00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:47,800
their interactions are all well known

00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,750
quantities lawyers know how they work

00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,250
there's a body of scholarly research on

00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,530
how they affect projects how they affect

00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:55,030
companies and so on I am old enough to

00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:56,620
remember when open source licenses were

00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:59,020
shunned by commercial organizations

00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,850
simply because lawyers didn't understand

00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,530
them yet they're complex the

00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:04,450
consequences for mistakes were huge and

00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:06,550
so lawyers were as they always are

00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:09,160
conservative and said no that's their

00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:11,230
job we've broken down that barrier now

00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,150
but it's taken decades of advocacy and

00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:16,780
lots of work by the legal community and

00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:18,580
you can leverage all of that work simply

00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,810
by picking a known license if you write

00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,240
your own license you have to break down

00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:23,770
those walls by yourself it's also really

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,020
easy to introduce unexpected

00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:28,210
consequences jslint it's a really good

00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:30,940
example jayus Lynch license is the MIT

00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:34,230
license with us 11 appended clause this

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:36,970
software must not be used for evil oh

00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:39,699
how cute

00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:42,160
side effect is that most Linux

00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:44,410
distributors cannot distribute this code

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,649
because they cannot ensure that their

00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:49,899
users are not going to do evil IBM's

00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:52,209
lawyers even went as far as to go to the

00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:55,180
go to Douglas Crockford the writer of

00:15:52,209 --> 00:16:00,310
jslint and get an explicit license from

00:15:55,180 --> 00:16:02,139
the author to do evil so unless you have

00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:05,319
a really good reason and let's be clear

00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:08,379
you don't have a good reason don't roll

00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:10,089
your own license now legal concerns

00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:11,829
don't stop with copyright copyright is

00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:14,139
about the work itself how you identify

00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:15,899
that work is a separate issue entirely

00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:18,759
and that's where trademarks come in a

00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:21,730
trademark is literally a mark of trade

00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:24,040
it's how you identify your work it can

00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,930
be a word symbol as if colors shape

00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,850
combination of all those things anything

00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:30,279
you used to identify your project how do

00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:31,959
you get one you start using a word to

00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:33,129
identify your product or service you

00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:34,810
don't have to do anything else as long

00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:38,170
as you're using a name you can assert

00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:39,189
trademark rights you can if you won't go

00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:42,250
through the process of formally

00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:44,019
registering a trademark and you that's

00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,279
done our nation basis it can be done

00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:47,589
internationally but obviously it's a lot

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,990
more paperwork registration though

00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:51,490
doesn't give you any more rights it just

00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,870
makes it easier to claim your rights

00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,639
because you've got paperwork that says

00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:58,000
when you started using your your

00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:02,519
trademark as an example how many people

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,110
know what this is does it look familiar

00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:06,730
it's an Australian fast food restaurant

00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:11,709
chain noted for their signature burger

00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:16,000
the whopper there's a problem in

00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:18,400
Australia when when the burger king came

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,370
to Australia there was already another

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,010
company using that name I only had one

00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:26,439
store in Adelaide but they had the

00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:28,600
trademark Burger King had to pick

00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:29,860
another name it didn't matter that they

00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,000
were a bigger company that they were an

00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,289
international company that they were

00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,700
going to make better use of the name

00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:35,409
there was an existing trademark

00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,600
registration and they had to change

00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:39,610
their name they chose hungry jacks

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,350
because that was a trademark the parent

00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:44,970
company already earned it used to be a

00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,970
pancake mix made by Pillsbury

00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,590
another example that's closer to home

00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,120
couple years ago British organization

00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:53,900
trying to register a trademark for the

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,040
name Python to describe cloud software

00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,600
they claimed ignorance they didn't know

00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,720
that Python was used in cloud software

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,180
already PSN moister complaints arguing

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,770
prior you send the company back down now

00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,720
this wasn't done because of the US

00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,280
trademark registration a US trademark

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,870
registration doesn't hold much weight in

00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,400
Europe but the psf was able to

00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:13,260
demonstrate that the name Python had

00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,450
been used for cloud software for many

00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,890
years prior this registration and that

00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:19,650
company made the cut made the made the

00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:22,290
trademark application moot trademark

00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:23,820
applications are also scoped a trademark

00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:26,010
is generally only granted for a specific

00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,900
subject area in the u.s. there are

00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:32,160
actually three trademark registrations

00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:33,690
for the name Django the DSS usage is for

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,310
downloadable open source computer

00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,780
software for use in connection with

00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,790
internet publishing and website

00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,560
development so no one else can get the

00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:42,090
name Django registered for that purpose

00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,940
or use the names anger for that purpose

00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:46,920
a second registration is for pics for

00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,120
guitars and other musical instruments so

00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,530
it's all I breezier idiot bridge

00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,330
instruments right here in Pennsylvania

00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,460
so if the DSF wanted to start selling

00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,990
Django brand guitar picks it wouldn't be

00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,250
allowed to or at least briefly reed

00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:59,190
instruments could stop the sale really

00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:01,080
easily the third registration is for

00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:02,460
perfumes Rouge face powders toilet

00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,660
waters cologne waters cosmetic skin

00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,130
creams and lotions lipsticks nail

00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,410
lacquers hair lotion solutions for the

00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:11,280
beard bath salts talcum powder and

00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:13,500
entrances luckily this one expired in

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,570
1971 so it's clearly just a matter of

00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:21,650
time before the DSF start selling Django

00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:25,200
brand beard Lucian know exactly yeah

00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:27,210
sorry does this all really matter yes a

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,010
trademark is what's lets you stop other

00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:30,780
people from doing bad things in your

00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:33,510
name and this is in an abstract idea

00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,130
either the DSF had to stop lawyers I had

00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:38,160
to engage lawyers to stop someone

00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:41,130
selling Django two point oh it was

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:46,200
jangra 0.96 with enterprise features

00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:49,290
like a lack of bug fixes now the thing

00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:52,440
is this was a completely legitimate use

00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:56,640
under Django's source code copyright

00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:58,050
license but Django's trademark belongs

00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,880
to the DSF and it

00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:02,070
can't be used without the DSS permission

00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,440
and as a result the company was told

00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:07,080
we'll put in a headlock and told to stop

00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,000
there to stop doing it now this raises

00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,960
an interesting question what happens to

00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,310
wake up when it comes to open source

00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,780
projects how do you get permission to

00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,310
use the trademark on the one hand you

00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,110
want the Django community to better use

00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:17,460
the Django name but you also have to

00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:20,700
protect the community from nefarious

00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:22,020
actors answer once again is a license if

00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,790
you want to put a commercial logo and

00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,860
your product you need to get and usually

00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,720
pay for a license to do so in the case

00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,520
of the DSF there is a license for the

00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,860
Django name and logo just a much more

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,990
liberal one and once again if you don't

00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:37,740
have a license to use that trademark you

00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:38,870
can't use it except the one exception is

00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,130
something called nominative use

00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:43,560
nominative uses that that usage that is

00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:45,570
necessary in language to name a thing if

00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:48,030
I wanted to say Django was released in

00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:49,740
2005 I can't do that without using the

00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:52,140
names anger or at least it would be very

00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:54,270
cumbersome to do so so trademark or

00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:57,390
carves out good nominative use as a

00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,830
specific exception however that

00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:00,390
nominative use doesn't stretch through

00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:02,340
logos typefaces or other forms of

00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:04,380
identity it's just the word so you can

00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:06,450
use it to refer to things the one thing

00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,770
that isn't nominative is the you is

00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:09,990
incorporating someone else's trademark

00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:11,700
into your own one of the tests for

00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,320
nominative use is to weather is whether

00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,430
your usage would confuse someone into

00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,890
believing there was an association

00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:18,180
between two products so the best

00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:20,460
solution if you're going to set up a

00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:22,020
company please don't incorporate someone

00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,640
else's trademark into your own so don't

00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,320
call yourself Django software

00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,800
consultants because that gets you into

00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:30,150
some very messy territory so far I've

00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,560
been very much focused on the legal

00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,910
aspects of maintaining an open source

00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,920
project but it's important to know that

00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:36,330
measures of success for a project or

00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,580
about all much more than just covering

00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:41,610
your butt want to talk about two others

00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:43,170
one briefly in minor more detail we are

00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,870
for the most part techies and I know the

00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:47,070
drill we had ads we had sales people

00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,390
sales and marketing is very very

00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,860
important i'm going to give a second

00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:53,070
talk this afternoon that covers this

00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:54,540
part of the puzzle so so come along and

00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,920
now trigger warning about to start

00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,660
talking about depression and burnout so

00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,340
there are some aspects of open source

00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:01,620
projects that are almost unique to open

00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,210
source many of you will know a

00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,620
children's book called the giving tree

00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,210
for those who don't know what the book

00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,410
is the story of an apple tree and a boy

00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:09,900
who are able to communicate with each

00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,280
other in his childhood the boy enjoys

00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,789
playing with the tree climbing its

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,739
trunks when

00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:15,179
instruments branches as time passes he

00:22:13,739 --> 00:22:17,039
starts to exploit the tree initially he

00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:18,359
just sells the apples then he cuts the

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,830
branches of the tree to make lumber for

00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:21,239
a house then he cuts down the trunk of

00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:23,190
the tree to make a boat each

00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:25,200
progressively stay a destructive stage

00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:26,720
is promoted by the tree itself and ends

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,399
with a sentence and the tree was happy

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,200
the final pages the tree sadly says she

00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:32,549
has nothing left to give as their apples

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,590
branches and trunk are all gone and on

00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:36,600
your stump remains the story is

00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:38,039
sometimes told is a parable the joys of

00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,659
giving and selfless love but it's also

00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:42,749
cited as an example of an abusive

00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:44,909
relationship and in both interpretations

00:22:42,749 --> 00:22:46,499
it's a story that's a really good

00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:49,349
analogy for open source communities if

00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:51,029
you're maintaining a project it's really

00:22:49,349 --> 00:22:53,580
easy to keep giving of yourself until

00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:54,989
you have nothing left to give especially

00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,450
if it's a project you started or you

00:22:54,989 --> 00:22:58,590
invested a lot of your own time in it

00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:00,840
helping other people gives you a great

00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:03,599
rush seeing other people use your

00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,309
project is a great feeling but it's also

00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:06,629
really easy to fall into the trap of

00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:08,789
giving until you don't have anything

00:23:06,629 --> 00:23:10,559
left to give on the other end it's easy

00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:11,759
to keep taking and without realizing the

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,729
load that you're putting on the person

00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:15,720
who's giving I've made no secret of the

00:23:14,729 --> 00:23:17,159
fact that I've been struggling with

00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,690
depression for a couple of years now a

00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:20,549
big part of the reason that I stepped

00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:22,169
down from the DSF last year was that I

00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:23,970
came to the realization that i was

00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:25,499
giving too much of myself to django i

00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:28,349
wasn't growing new branches i'd reached

00:23:25,499 --> 00:23:29,669
the point where i was just a stump but i

00:23:28,349 --> 00:23:30,869
didn't want to step down from the DSF

00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:32,940
because if i didn't do it who else was

00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:34,320
going to do it you know what turns out

00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,669
this is an awesome community and when I

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,409
said I was stepping down people like

00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:40,200
Frank whilst that stepped up and took

00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:41,429
over if this was a commercial the

00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,899
primarily commercial community that

00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:44,700
decision is easy you don't like your job

00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:46,460
you change jobs it's not quite that

00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,599
simple but you know you can change jobs

00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,220
you're exchanging money for labor you

00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:52,019
stop getting paid you're not expected to

00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,999
provide labor anymore and you're not

00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:56,070
only your only reasonably expected to

00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:57,690
have one job at a time but you know

00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:59,700
volunteer scenario the exit path isn't

00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:01,379
as clear it's easy to acquire

00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,080
responsibility but a lot harder to

00:24:01,379 --> 00:24:05,580
divest it as an individual you need to

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,109
make sure you look after yourself as a

00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:10,799
community you need to build structures

00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:12,720
so this doesn't happen one way to do

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,389
this is to institutionalize exits from

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,039
key roles set term limits or at the very

00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:19,529
least provide regular opportunities

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,899
where an active opt-in is required that

00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:23,179
regular requirement for an opt-in means

00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:26,019
there's an opt-out point as well

00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:28,970
responsibility shouldn't last forever

00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:30,860
better still set up community structures

00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:33,080
with the expectation of free labor is

00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:34,279
minimized if you're identifying a role

00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,259
it's going to take resources be it

00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:37,580
material labor emotional energy don't

00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:39,049
just assume those resources will be

00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,059
available forever in boundless

00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:42,590
quantities the greatest shocks occur

00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:46,039
when something we assume is plentiful

00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:48,139
and ubiquitous disappears gasoline

00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:49,759
electricity clean water if you're open

00:24:48,139 --> 00:24:51,259
source project isn't planning for the

00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,450
day when your biggest contributor steps

00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:56,059
down your project has a clock on it and

00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:58,159
if you're a commercial organization who

00:24:56,059 --> 00:25:00,440
depends on that project I would argue

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,389
you are being criminally negligent to

00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,639
your investors because you have not

00:25:02,389 --> 00:25:07,009
secured your supply chain you haven't

00:25:04,639 --> 00:25:10,369
mitigated the key risk associated with

00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:11,989
using that software the this approach

00:25:10,369 --> 00:25:13,249
helps to stave off bone out amongst your

00:25:11,989 --> 00:25:15,019
volunteers but it also has the added

00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:17,179
benefit that it broadens the list of

00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:18,739
people who can do the work volunteers by

00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:20,899
definition are made up by those who have

00:25:18,739 --> 00:25:23,659
the time to volunteer if you've got a

00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:26,269
family or children or a loved one I

00:25:23,659 --> 00:25:28,159
needs care that limits your ability to

00:25:26,269 --> 00:25:29,960
volunteer you want to address diversity

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,190
make sure you're not just taking from

00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,109
the pool of people who have copious free

00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:34,309
time which broadly speaking means white

00:25:33,109 --> 00:25:37,940
middle Dwayne middle to upper-class

00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:39,950
anglo-saxon men aged 16 to 30 and if you

00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:42,289
are someone who uses open source don't

00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:44,059
just take give back in tangible ways

00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:46,249
either with hard commitments of time or

00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:48,590
with cash that organizations are the DSF

00:25:46,249 --> 00:25:50,090
can use and this is especially important

00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:51,799
if you're a large organization that has

00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:54,230
extraordinary resources at their

00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:56,659
disposal and who demand who derive

00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:59,119
immense via benefit from open source and

00:25:56,659 --> 00:26:01,129
their volunteer contributors sorry

00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:02,779
there's a survey of a few important

00:26:01,129 --> 00:26:04,340
things your parents didn't teach you

00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:06,409
about sharing your toys run along now

00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:08,419
children share your toys and have fun

00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:10,720
just be careful make sure you're home in

00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:10,720
time for dinner

00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,410
