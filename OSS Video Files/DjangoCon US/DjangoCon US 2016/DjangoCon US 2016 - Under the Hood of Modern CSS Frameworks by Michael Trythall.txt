Description: 
	Under the Hood of Modern CSS Frameworks by Michael Trythall

Together weâ€™ll look at the code behind Bootstrap, Foundation, Semantic UI, and other CSS frameworks. Weâ€™ll identify common patterns and architectural decisions that make these systems so easy to use. Some of the things weâ€™ll discover:

What it takes to set up a good type system.
How style and structure are separated to make theming easier.
Best practices for stubbing out grid systems.
How configuration works.
How to make everything feel cohesive.
What it takes to test a framework so you can potentially test your own.
So much more!
If youâ€™re looking to improve your skills with one of these frameworks or potentially roll your own mini-Bootstrap, this talk is for you.

00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:20,450
all right so hi Mike

00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:23,270
I build a SS framework for people a

00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:25,369
little bit of background this was a

00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,290
weird talk for me this is a huge topic

00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:30,820
if you really start to get into it which

00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:33,170
I did not know what I did my adds track

00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,540
but I've been doing this for so many

00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,370
years when I started in 1996 it's a kid

00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,900
it doesn't matter no one you know 20

00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,510
years 10 years none that matters but

00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:44,360
when I started as a kid we just had HTML

00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,470
right now big ol HTML 4 book and then

00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,670
over the years you start to sort of

00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,960
accumulate all these little tips and

00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,460
tricks and next thing you know you're

00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,930
building these complex things you don't

00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:55,579
really quite realize you've maybe they

00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:57,320
built a framework or when I started

00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:59,660
thinking about this this topic I had

00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:04,070
just rolled off of a medium size content

00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:05,570
management system based on I wasn't

00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:08,479
doing the CMS what's the other cool one

00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,950
wagtail and Lincoln with those quite a

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,170
bit of these sort of split between web

00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,580
applications and you know traditional I

00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,050
need to get something done put some

00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,929
stuff then get something out and in

00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:22,100
large-scale content management systems

00:01:16,929 --> 00:01:25,069
so I was on a medium medium scale CMS we

00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:28,550
did everything literally custom using my

00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:30,920
big old bag of tricks and did the design

00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:32,360
completely ourselves and it was the one

00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,280
project that I had done a long time that

00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,500
I was really happy with because I hated

00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,940
all the magic trick worked for years and

00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,690
years

00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:41,450
there was definitely things that I

00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:44,539
learned that were hard kind of doing

00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,849
something in 2000 late 2015 or 2016 well

00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:48,319
different no we're done years before but

00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:49,849
it came together well and then I

00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,099
immediately jumped over to an extremely

00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:54,979
large content management system or a

00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:57,050
large national nonprofit that's that

00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:58,610
project is ongoing the contrast of that

00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,619
project is that they wanted to large

00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,840
they wanted a well known CSS framework

00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:04,910
so I had just come off something making

00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,140
a whole bunch of mistakes and going into

00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:09,590
something where all the mistakes were

00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:11,540
made for me already we ended up going

00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,980
with Serb foundation and it's been going

00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,370
very very well but it's choose

00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:18,280
difference when I did start with this

00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,780
talk

00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,940
I'm planning on going extremely deep

00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,160
with everything and getting in stuff

00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,470
being very very technical but the

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,510
problem is is that when you really look

00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:30,580
under the hood of these things they're

00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,130
not that scary there really isn't a

00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,690
whole lot of magic like there used to be

00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:36,970
and a lot of that is because CSS has

00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,260
sort of caught up and we're getting

00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:41,350
better at documenting we're getting

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,700
better at clarifying things and I don't

00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:46,150
know the best practices that people are

00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,470
using just aren't quite as I I think a

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,440
lot of that kind of boils down to think

00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:53,410
of browsers aren't so bad anymore and

00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:56,650
they taste what I try to do here is go

00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:58,540
through whole bunch of frameworks and of

00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,340
course five years of my good and bad

00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:09,370
code most of it very bad

00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:11,380
don't tell those folks 3/4 No

00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,940
so I went to a whole bunch of frameworks

00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,590
and I actually do this fairly regularly

00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:19,110
when clients come in the door trying to

00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:21,550
figure out how to get things done and I

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,110
had a lot of a lot of things I could

00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:27,310
pull from essentially what I'm trying to

00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:31,329
say and that kind of got me really

00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,799
thinking about what's in sort of these

00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:34,239
modern frameworks right they're all a

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,140
little bit different and stuff that I

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:41,739
was doing was quite a bit differently it

00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:43,209
does sort of all boil down to what and

00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:45,070
the converter folks have seen this term

00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:48,220
but design systems the fancy designer

00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:50,380
term for just module components or we

00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,670
should I make things complicated but the

00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,959
stuff on the left is sort of the core

00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:55,660
things that you're gonna find just about

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,269
anywhere or in any good system I would

00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,100
say most places or most systems don't

00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:02,049
necessarily call all these things out as

00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,579
being important but they are the things

00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:06,310
on the right or sort of the stuff that

00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:10,120
can I want to say could be bolted on you

00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:11,560
don't necessarily need CSS to do form

00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,049
validation that you could use the new

00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,700
libraries and get away with it

00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:19,060
components are always going to be based

00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,530
on opinion bootstrap has a hero if some

00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,680
of them don't have Heroes some of them

00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:25,050
have you know resets or different types

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,520
of lists some of them don't

00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,020
behaviors animation how things are going

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,569
to work

00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,830
click them interact with them that's

00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:34,379
gonna be very opinionated

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:37,319
so those stuff on the right we're not

00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:40,379
really gonna get into simply because you

00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:42,270
can swap it out as needed and testing is

00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:46,800
one of those things that everybody kind

00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:48,120
of does very wrong everything I do have

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,729
some thoughts man I'll mention that

00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,770
towards the end here but more so after

00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:54,150
we talk some I talk primarily gonna

00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,159
focus on three site configuration

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,990
colored man photography and rhythm and

00:04:56,159 --> 00:05:00,389
layout and what I'm gonna try to show

00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,530
you is it there's no mystery here under

00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:03,180
the hood these things aren't really all

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,440
that complicated they're just using some

00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,449
stuff that's new you might not have

00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,120
heard of and using those few new things

00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:10,680
you can get really far not like the old

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,020
days when everything really was all

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,430
magic and hacks it's gross and it's a

00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,229
lot simpler than a deuce completes the

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:21,270
bundling that kind of makes these things

00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:24,330
nice let's start with presets CSS preset

00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:27,569
is essentially a way of attracting away

00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:30,360
all of the bad browser stuff so it's not

00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:31,800
necessarily defining the style in fact

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,020
it really shouldn't it shouldn't be

00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,340
going in and giving you a base set of

00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,659
stuff that's what your framework we're

00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,830
trying to do is equalize all the

00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:41,190
different browsers work around the

00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:44,370
quirks a lot of browsers have a tendency

00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:47,310
to either have incorrect sizing and

00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,539
spacing or they will just not handle

00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,909
things from an accessibility standpoint

00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:53,729
that well you won't get outlines or

00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:56,699
sizing won't work or break focus

00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:58,259
elements and the most popular one out

00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:59,159
there seems to still be normalized that

00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:02,279
CSS

00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:03,810
I'm sure who hasn't who's using

00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:06,180
normalize my project I'm sure most these

00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:08,190
folks right it's sort of become an

00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,289
industry most people don't really

00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,400
question it's phenomenal if you start

00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:12,650
googling around and kind of find

00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,940
alternatives you're not gonna find

00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,740
anything that's all that great or

00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,680
there's really all that different I

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:22,169
think there might be one called reset

00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:25,080
Eric Meyer who not familiar one of the

00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:26,880
founding people's modern CSS has one and

00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,270
doesn't really get used but it still

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,669
pops up in the search results normalizes

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:35,099
it is sort of the standard I would say

00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:38,729
nowadays and it's got a few issues with

00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:41,010
it like all reset steal first off it can

00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:43,230
be a little heavy 7k

00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:45,270
it works with a lot of browsers that you

00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:47,520
might not care about there's stuff for

00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,650
like i7 and some places and I don't know

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,150
I mean some folks I'm sure is still

00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,310
using it a lot of a lot of people short

00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:54,300
move away from some of the older ones

00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:58,320
has a lot of things that are just

00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:01,220
crossing for example it it does things

00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,960
with the kbd tag it'll do things with I

00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,670
don't know really cares about keyboard

00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,620
output on your screen but it'll reset

00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:09,660
those styles for you too it's always

00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,650
seemed a little weird for me a lot it's

00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,110
got a lot of stuff that I think most

00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:14,160
people aren't probably using med said I

00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,280
don't really know how you can get away

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:21,150
from it these days and then one last

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,920
point here they can add another layer

00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:25,350
this always drives me nuts when I'm

00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,450
going to and inspect something opening

00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:29,810
up Chrome you have that blood gigantic

00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:32,510
list the styles that are impacting your

00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,620
computed styles it's just another layer

00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,820
where I'm trying to go with this is that

00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,370
when you add these things to your

00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:40,650
project take a look at what's actually

00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:43,350
going in there maybe you don't need a

00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:45,510
heavy-handed reset every single one of

00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,740
the major frameworks that I looked at is

00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,790
also just doing things a little bit

00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,830
differently

00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:51,960
Foundation for example sort of includes

00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,820
normalized right into I think it's one

00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,620
in there it's some sort of set up

00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:58,710
function but instead of burgeoning it

00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:03,750
out it's just baked in which is a little

00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:05,010
weird right because you can't we just we

00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,080
describe the reports all the time too

00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,880
broadly things are gonna change

00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,260
constantly and having something that is

00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,920
essentially the foundation of your

00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:15,150
foundation is it's just a little odd we

00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,270
can't swap it out if something comes

00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,950
along it's gonna be directly tied in

00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,060
with everything that you have just tight

00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:25,800
coupling that's sometimes a pipe

00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:27,570
coupling fad right if you're looking for

00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,310
a reset or if you're sort of rolling

00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:32,280
your own and this could just depend on

00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,600
the setup that you have try to look for

00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,670
something that either has very efficient

00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,630
selectors some of the other resets that

00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,190
I did find some of the older ones

00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,600
especially or some of the things that

00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,850
I've seen other folks do if they're

00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,580
building on reset is they can get a

00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:46,070
little long in the tooth with their

00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,270
selectors

00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:51,690
resetting you to too many things or

00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:54,240
doing similar properties or similar

00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,470
styles in multiple places the whole

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,700
point this thing is it's supposed to be

00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:02,400
lean and well document it too I threw

00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,810
that in there because as a knock to

00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,520
normalize it does have a lot of comments

00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,600
but I think most people probably ripping

00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:12,120
those out at some point time

00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,740
configuration if you have work with

00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,430
bootstrap foundation or any of these

00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,600
other ones you'll know that they have

00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:20,880
sorry you'll know that they have a ton

00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,250
of configuration this can be a little

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,930
all over the place so let's take a look

00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:29,430
at it one thing to remember is that

00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:31,490
since these pretty much all are a bunch

00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:34,190
of different systems essentially sort of

00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:36,240
working together very well

00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:39,810
there's got to be some stuff that you

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,340
can turn on off right not every system

00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,110
is going to be required just like in

00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,460
most frameworks I think one of the great

00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,200
things about Django is that it's got a

00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,460
lot of batteries included you can ignore

00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,330
some of those batteries some of those

00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:51,960
batteries you can't

00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:53,640
same thing with CSS frameworks the slide

00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,400
I had earlier when I had the two columns

00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,050
the stuff on the left at the poverty

00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,210
system the reset those are things you

00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,130
need to have a base really to lay things

00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:04,500
out on the page you have to have some

00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:08,760
support systems there things you can PI

00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,530
turn off forms components validations

00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,960
those sort of things most frameworks

00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:14,310
make everything pretty easy to configure

00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,800
except when it comes to that core

00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:20,880
configuration you're probably all very

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,930
familiar with this but this is any time

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,760
you open up any of these frameworks

00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:27,990
you're gonna get a long lengthy list of

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:30,990
imports I don't know if this is gross or

00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:34,500
not cuz this is all I know but it's

00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:36,720
always felt a little gross I think on

00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,460
the left is strictly bootstrapping on

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,560
the right is Foundation there's just two

00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:43,620
seem to be that heavy weighted ones you

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,360
can see there's some organization stops

00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,760
combing the components type form

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,220
whatever so that there is some some

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,420
logical split there we're going your own

00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,600
route definitely keep

00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:56,100
this again I can't think of anything

00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,460
different other than maybe you're

00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,870
including components and then there's a

00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,900
components file and the components

00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:05,340
bottom concludes all this but I've

00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,040
always liked this as a table of contents

00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:10,470
right you can go in and see very quickly

00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,790
what's been included in the project you

00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:15,750
can turn off whatever you need right

00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:18,150
then in there there's no guessing most

00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,490
frameworks keep their variable or

00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,690
bullish this is a weird one and then

00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:29,240
calling us out for a very specific

00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:33,930
reason this is foundation these are

00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:37,230
global font styles okay in the

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:38,430
Department of five right so typography I

00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,800
would say it's probably one of those

00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:42,240
four things you have to have but if I'm

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,880
just trying to go through and just make

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,820
some quick changes I have to drill down

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,910
in finance this is an only one massive

00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,080
file right which is kind of good and bad

00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,310
it means you're coming from the Jango

00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:57,150
space I think we do a lot of global

00:11:53,310 --> 00:12:00,110
figuration but this impacts everything

00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,110
and I have to dig for it

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,240
bootstraps a lot better about tends to

00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,380
put everything in one long file again I

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,420
think that's I think that's the way to

00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:15,000
go oh I'm sorry I got a little confused

00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:17,130
there this is the font file this would

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,410
be the global file there's there's my

00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:22,710
example this is the stuff that would be

00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:24,630
mess in a very day and the reason why I

00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:27,870
say is this believes everywhere is that

00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:29,850
when it comes to color type your grid

00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,230
those are things that are gonna impact

00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,300
every single component every single

00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:35,010
element on the page they're important

00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:40,350
why not put them when I put them in the

00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:42,720
global space one of the things that I've

00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,100
learned the large file here is names

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,710
that you name spacing the important

00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,080
stuff if you are sort of going your own

00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:51,630
route or your shoehorning something into

00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,060
an existing framework it's just a good

00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:57,930
practice to sort of make sure there's no

00:12:53,060 --> 00:13:00,300
collisions header sizes are a really

00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:01,860
good example that colors are another one

00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,260
I had some stuff with colors will show

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,010
you folks on a little bit but it's not

00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,140
uncommon to go

00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,970
grab some just random code or no library

00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,090
somewhere and somebody resets whatever

00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:13,830
gray is or blue or something like that

00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:15,660
they start messing with your your I

00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:18,600
don't know heights or padding or

00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,220
whatever else so one of these that I

00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,390
started to do this use maps and you'll

00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:25,800
notice this is SAS code but just name

00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:28,320
spacing everything keeping all of my

00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,730
important logic inside of a map giving a

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,080
good name I mean no one's gonna you

00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,860
might have header sizes I don't think

00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,080
many people are gonna overwrite that

00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,970
I've seen I've been on projects where

00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,090
we've had you know project name or like

00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:41,070
initials - something but name facing

00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:42,060
kind of goes a long way especially if

00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,040
you're throwing a lot of things together

00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,230
and also lets you do some cool things

00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,690
that I'll show later on breakpoints is

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:51,300
another example you'll see this a lot in

00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:56,040
all the frameworks they all sort of have

00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:58,170
a immediate query map of some sort I

00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,160
think it makes a lot of the logic for

00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:06,150
handling media queries a little easier

00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:07,590
moving along to parka pee I mention it

00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:17,850
over and over again tahiry's important

00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:19,410
and I'll show you folks why a basic two

00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:23,340
part of this system is going to have a

00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:26,640
basic font size a baseline height some

00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:28,020
presets you'll see these typically you

00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,090
have your your reset and then you're

00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,740
building on top of this but even

00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:33,000
foundations to park your file boot ships

00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:36,870
to park your file just have a lot of

00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,450
safe defaults right they let's test the

00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:41,850
block code size 1 through 6 from the

00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:44,640
heading sizes paragraphs probably gonna

00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:46,830
end up being your base size but then

00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,420
they also start to solve you know do the

00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:50,670
parking system starts to solve things

00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,220
about them so it's hard to stop spacing

00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:57,810
to the elements in different components

00:14:52,220 --> 00:15:00,770
and this is really important because it

00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:03,270
sets the whole rhythm for the whole site

00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:05,310
which we'll get to in a second this is a

00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:07,350
really quick example I'm sorry folks or

00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:10,320
you know you've seen this anywhere

00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:13,440
you've seen just in basic variables

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,240
basic line height line height is

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,350
unitless

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,460
this is one thing I'm starting to see

00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:20,790
more of you

00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:24,810
where instead of having like 24 pixels

00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:27,839
it just states 2 3 double what it was I

00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:35,339
need double spacing so it's just 2 3 or

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:37,670
whatever you want another example here a

00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:40,410
bootstrap what they're doing with their

00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,700
heads they have to go a little step

00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:44,610
further and make the font size as

00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:46,290
configurable you go back to my other

00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:50,880
example I'll go a few steps back you'll

00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:52,320
see that from foundation foundation does

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,570
that but it actually ties it to the

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:58,620
media query so on the small media

00:15:54,570 --> 00:16:00,300
queries these are all the sizes we could

00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,190
have a medium large whatever you wanted

00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,020
and then their whole responsive system

00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:05,880
sort of knows where they're at and shows

00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:08,610
the right the right sizes my opinion

00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,230
it's a little complicated can be a

00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:13,940
little hard to follow in the bug but it

00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,940
does it works great it's nice and robust

00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:19,470
one of these that I wanted time it real

00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:21,300
quick about is I always thought this was

00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:25,410
weird and I've seen some some frameworks

00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:29,279
do this if I am working in the right

00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:31,200
side sidebar of my page I guess it's not

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,690
all that strange to say this heading

00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,260
even if it's an h3 I want the size of an

00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:37,020
h6

00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:39,209
I guess it's good to think in terms of

00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,440
those predefined headings I've always

00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:44,250
preferred just thinking in terms of

00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:48,300
sizes so this one is this element would

00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:50,339
be double the size at the base font I

00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,589
don't know a little different but I

00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:54,600
think this is a kind of a slippery slope

00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:56,279
that kind of gets you into class itis

00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,470
where you could end up having a lot of

00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:03,480
elements that just have h6 and then blue

00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:06,449
and then active or whatever else I tend

00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:09,420
to like the abstract that stuff away but

00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:12,770
in case that's the pretty simple example

00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:15,540
of setting up some configuration

00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:17,010
good typography is hard

00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:19,200
my wife is actually getting the talk

00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:21,240
tomorrow on the basis of the pocket

00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:24,900
Phish years ago we finally got obsessed

00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:28,020
with it in design community you'll hear

00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:30,000
the term vertical rhythm a lot and this

00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:33,660
is where topography becomes so crucial

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,580
to a project not everything can be pixel

00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,110
based nowadays everything is to become

00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,550
stretchy responsive we've got to deal

00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:44,100
with people who wanna just the font size

00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:49,110
on their screen and the relationship the

00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:50,370
relationship with sizing as far berroco

00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,600
rhythm it's essentially the homeowners

00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:55,680
the harmonious spacing between

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,600
everything in a document the best way

00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,340
for me to do this is to show you guys

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,790
what this looks like this is a really

00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:07,170
simple example of what's called a

00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:09,170
modular scale it's a type of vertical

00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:12,840
rhythm and what you'll see here is that

00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:15,120
this first line doesn't spool out of

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,630
this little bounding box every single

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:22,170
line is on this little dotted line their

00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:24,210
spacing between these two elements and

00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:26,550
this is just text but their spacing

00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:27,870
between these two elements and if you

00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:30,510
were to go further down this page in

00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:33,390
this example you'll see that the page

00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:35,130
just looks right right it's not you

00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:42,180
don't have ten pixels here and five

00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:43,560
pixels here that's hard so a lot of the

00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:49,040
frameworks these days are cheating and

00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:52,860
keeping it simple they use wrench

00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:56,420
anybody here come in with friends great

00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,420
okay you guys should be up here

00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:04,580
I always have trouble explaining what

00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:07,710
rhymes are my wife yells at me constant

00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:11,130
anyway it's essentially a type of

00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:14,700
graphic constant it's a global size

00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:18,120
based format tight right now the way

00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:22,710
this is set up is by setting the base

00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:26,130
size on the HTML so you can say my basic

00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:28,890
size there's 20 pixels and anytime I

00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:32,790
reference a ramp it's gonna be 20

00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:35,310
pictures the font size 20 pixels margin

00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:39,600
bottom 40 paces I do math correctly I

00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:44,730
think that's huge that's huge because

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:47,370
what we can do is we can say all of the

00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:50,160
spacing between everything is going to

00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:54,090
be one rent or to rent or three grand if

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:57,810
I increase my font size down and what I

00:19:54,090 --> 00:20:00,000
want to do I don't have to worry about

00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:02,850
pixel density you could come in with

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,030
some crazy Steve Jobs made it from the

00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:08,190
grade device and it could have a million

00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:10,500
pixels per square centimeter or

00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:13,650
something nuts and it's just gonna be

00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,450
based on the part that you have what a

00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:22,310
lot of folks do and it's a little little

00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:30,450
out of out of scope for this example is

00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:34,740
they'll use two boxes nothing crazy glue

00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:35,910
boards whatever kind of base them the

00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,340
same thing but what we'll do is this

00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:41,760
will use brands for spacing between

00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:45,800
elements they'll use em on the inside of

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:49,650
the box so that all of the relationships

00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:51,990
between things inside of a container are

00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:54,450
relative to each other so if I have a

00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:57,870
heading user imagination here but if I

00:20:54,450 --> 00:21:01,740
had a little subtitle here and it needed

00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:04,010
to be very small but related in size for

00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:07,050
that main heading that might be M based

00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:08,519
and then I can just apply size for one

00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:10,799
of these boxes and have a

00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:12,450
guess what the spacing between each one

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:16,979
of these is going to be consistent on my

00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:21,419
my main font size I said Foundation does

00:21:16,979 --> 00:21:23,700
this I think does it as well foundation

00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:25,649
actually has a REM calc function that

00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:29,309
you can throw it pixels or whatever else

00:21:25,649 --> 00:21:30,539
and it will convert it over to Ren's but

00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:32,940
the idea is is that it gives you sort of

00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:34,769
just this consistency through everything

00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:38,129
which makes that protocol rhythm

00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:40,499
harmonious spacing and sizing and

00:21:38,129 --> 00:21:44,909
everything between are you through the

00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:47,609
points it makes a lot more solid and

00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:51,029
with that I think you can avoid a lot of

00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:52,859
I want to say boilerplate stuff that

00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:54,209
you'll find out in the wild a lot of

00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:57,359
folks for a few years we're trying to

00:21:54,209 --> 00:21:59,159
solve this by add-ons and huge CSS files

00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:02,669
but there's only has to be that

00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:07,259
complicated and the other thing that

00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:09,389
I've seen is that well I'll show you in

00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:11,099
this example it's one of the issues that

00:22:09,389 --> 00:22:12,509
I've seen with vertical rhythm just

00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:15,899
spacing the sizing you said it doesn't

00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:17,279
really ever pull up there's always an

00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:19,799
exception there's always something a

00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:21,149
little weird so I think over defining it

00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:22,739
and this is what the frameworks don't do

00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:24,209
they don't over define it by giving you

00:22:22,739 --> 00:22:26,129
you know too many tools and putting too

00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:28,440
many things too many places you don't

00:22:26,129 --> 00:22:30,059
have situations where you put two

00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:33,859
components side by side and they don't

00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:38,549
feel right this is a page from

00:22:33,859 --> 00:22:40,559
foundations site template whatever and

00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:42,289
you can see that it doesn't really seem

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,779
on where I know it's kind of small but

00:22:42,289 --> 00:22:46,979
there's anything that's totally broken

00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:49,529
or feels like there's too much white

00:22:46,979 --> 00:22:52,079
space or just messed up and there's just

00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:55,529
some regular REM base size and we clean

00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:58,999
everything just mark it seems to work

00:22:55,529 --> 00:22:58,999
just with their universal constant

00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:05,089
15-minutes layout

00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:12,890
great systems used to be a lot harder

00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:16,070
they're not more typical grid system has

00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:17,270
some sort of container per box we're

00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,950
starting a grid you know if they're

00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:23,170
stored grids in the middle of text and

00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:25,520
whatever we can but you don't look bad

00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:28,250
usually get some helpers for columns

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,870
laying things out there's some gutter

00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,550
definitions so I want this much space

00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:34,640
between each things much based on the

00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:36,560
sides and then typically I think when

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,000
people think of media queries they

00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,380
probably first and foremost think about

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,660
moving boxes around you don't really

00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:43,130
think resizing a lot of other elements

00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,770
but working with your grade is probably

00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:47,510
the first place to start every single

00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:50,600
one of the frameworks has some sort of

00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:54,110
grid helpers this is just a very basic

00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,190
example of what a container I think I

00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:57,080
have this on every single project

00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:59,570
foundation bootstrap will have the same

00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,190
thing the benefit of splitting it out as

00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:05,810
a mixin and not just having a container

00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:09,740
class is so that you can avoid difficult

00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:11,120
Aynor everywhere all the time it's not

00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,970
shown here but one of the things that

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,220
I've tried to do is if I have a

00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:20,050
component and it does have a wrapper it

00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:22,670
gets a name that's partially generic so

00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:24,620
but also tied to the component so it's a

00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:30,170
text component and might be text wrapper

00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:31,790
or something like that my opinion can

00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,290
make code a little bit more portable

00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:34,850
outside

00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:41,660
everybody's containers are a little bit

00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:44,480
different it's what spot's just jump

00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:46,220
right in to all of the major frameworks

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,050
that i've seen are starting to use this

00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:51,230
API clock flex plots who here is

00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:52,490
familiar with black box okay so I love

00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:55,040
flex box I've been using it for a few

00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:57,280
years now it makes my life a lot easier

00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:00,410
it's very good at 1 dimensional layout

00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:03,080
it's a weird definition that I've seen I

00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:04,430
stole this I work full-time but it's

00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,980
essentially you're not going up and down

00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:08,780
you're just going whether they're right

00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:13,840
it's really good at putting things in a

00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:16,359
line here's a really basic example

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:19,149
we have our container again but this

00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:21,219
time we're doing this play flex justify

00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:24,009
content space between and we have a max

00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:25,840
width that's big figure bool that's just

00:25:24,009 --> 00:25:28,929
a local most important thing is

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:34,960
justified content space between anything

00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:36,219
we put into our container flex box has

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,779
been in try to put as much space as it

00:25:36,219 --> 00:25:39,639
can between those things I only have one

00:25:37,779 --> 00:25:41,889
box here this would be a big wall white

00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:47,919
spot what I'm doing is I'm saying each

00:25:41,889 --> 00:25:50,559
box is 33 point 33 percent and there's

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,179
probably some pre-configured margin here

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,239
in my example what the idea is is that

00:25:52,179 --> 00:26:02,679
every one of these boxes is going to be

00:25:54,239 --> 00:26:03,879
33% wide which if you've seen that

00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:05,139
pattern going back to this you've

00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:11,710
probably seen that a million times on

00:26:05,139 --> 00:26:14,379
websites just pretty common is another

00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:17,379
example just a two column layout the

00:26:14,379 --> 00:26:19,839
first box has the Flex property

00:26:17,379 --> 00:26:22,330
flex one this is shorthand essentially

00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:25,149
just saying the box can grow as much as

00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:30,549
it needs to and has a margin right 20

00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:32,619
pixels so this box is going to sort of

00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:37,059
get pushed out and take up whatever

00:26:32,619 --> 00:26:38,229
space that's allowed to take this box is

00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:40,629
gonna take out as much space as it can

00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:43,239
take and then it'll just have a large 20

00:26:40,629 --> 00:26:45,009
pictures on the right so I cited those

00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:48,039
two examples because I build those all

00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:51,849
the time and build entire websites to

00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:55,869
patterns and that's really you don't you

00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:58,089
don't need a lot of flex box it has

00:26:55,869 --> 00:26:58,779
pretty good support I think 9 to 7 if I

00:26:58,089 --> 00:27:01,989
read that correctly

00:26:58,779 --> 00:27:02,529
roughly older browsers are gonna give

00:27:01,989 --> 00:27:08,049
you some trouble

00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:10,119
of course voice if you're not going back

00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:11,649
too far with IE you're probably okay I

00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:13,509
11 and some of the other ones just need

00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:15,820
to be prefixed properly there's a few

00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:18,460
dragons here and there but I've been

00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:20,019
using this for a few years and it's

00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,849
actually allowed me personally to

00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:22,640
replace some of my grid systems entirely

00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:26,809
I don't have

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,860
and heavy-handed grid it's just I need

00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:32,200
this thing here and this thing here

00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:32,200
flexbox three lines of code there you go

00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:37,160
using kelp is another really great tool

00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:39,020
compass and have that browser support

00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:42,049
I'll show you guys that in a minute

00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:43,670
oh capsule they neat because they'll you

00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:46,670
know perform a calculation with the

00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:48,679
types of Units hundred percent times

00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:51,740
one-third minus twenty pixels will give

00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:54,700
me a box that is 33.8 thirty-three pick

00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:57,080
earth percent wide minus twenty pixels

00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,809
works really great with just just by

00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:02,510
content space between and if all

00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:03,860
different types of scenarios and values

00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:06,530
you can put in justify content to get

00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:08,450
different things a really quick example

00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:11,559
of a really rough grid system that I've

00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:17,600
stubbed out recently and worked with is

00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:20,120
right here where on the row that I have

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:23,390
I'm saying all of the children are using

00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:26,570
this sorry folks buy it should be row

00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:28,250
here just me nice in the main ins last

00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:31,429
last minute but doing the same thing

00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:35,059
here saying that give me imagine number

00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:36,740
two give me my my percentage and 100%

00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:39,500
times the percentage is just a little

00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:44,570
easier to read right it's slightly use

00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:45,860
your map - the spacing it's the same

00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:49,490
thing I just I just showed you folks

00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:51,559
with this but what I can do is just say

00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:55,820
this row everything is going to be three

00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:57,440
columns or two problems or one column

00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:00,530
whatever whatever number you want to

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,530
pass in there will work again it built

00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:04,669
entire good systems based on that push

00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:06,890
that a foundation doing something very

00:29:04,669 --> 00:29:08,360
similar they're just taking numbers that

00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:09,650
you pass in with their pumpkins with

00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,850
their class names they're running it

00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:12,820
through a function and then they're just

00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:15,020
spitting out some really basic math and

00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:18,230
there you go we have percentages and

00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:21,190
some gutters and some padding this is

00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:27,440
the simplest one I could think of

00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:29,250
there's an example of that same thing 20

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:34,340
pixels Patti

00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:46,700
between each one so remember 33.3%

00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:50,280
33.33% - 20 tink think like that you can

00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:53,010
go kind of far with how accessible that

00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:56,160
is I tend to find if you're not using a

00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:57,450
great system assume Deb's only I've had

00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,740
editors try to get in and sort of work

00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,150
with some stuff and it's great but the

00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,800
math is it's just weird if you're not

00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:02,820
you're thinking in terms of content and

00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,360
therefore just sort of think about the

00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:08,100
greats a little weird calc has not as

00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,450
good a support a splotch box but if you

00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,770
don't finish much box or you're just

00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:12,990
doing some sizing to be inline-block

00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:16,890
something else you have some options

00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:19,800
there I definitely hit issues with old I

00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:22,530
eat and I lean off old versions of

00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:24,840
Android here's some different resources

00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:27,870
on flexbox cow it's pretty easy to look

00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:29,880
up but flexbox just a bit easier or a

00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:32,010
bit harder to grasp

00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,950
there's just a lot of weird quirks to it

00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:36,210
once you have your head around it's fine

00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:37,680
Lincoln Liv did a whole series called

00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:39,180
flexbox Friday where we took real-world

00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,590
examples and built them we did it

00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:43,980
Mason's your layout we did all kinds of

00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:45,240
cool stuff to my wife again but you did

00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,770
the cheap seat which seems to be pretty

00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,600
popular

00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:50,970
you just fruit it's cute check it out

00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,990
and then of course click order and some

00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:54,990
other folks that did some wonderful

00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:57,210
things as well last section here color

00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:58,800
those frameworks doing too much here

00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:01,160
which is always an odd to me because

00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:04,920
color is so important

00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:08,400
they'll make color configurable they'll

00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:11,370
do it like this very dark grey green

00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:15,350
later great lightest I've had a pen this

00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:17,240
with grey most dark grey darker darkest

00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:21,800
the darkest andreas you've ever seen

00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:24,620
isn't always been straining me I know

00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:26,330
eventually become flat great at which

00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:30,980
our floors just wait

00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:31,820
but I've always liked the idea of what

00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:34,010
are these in variables only how to

00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:35,180
example this later on so we need some

00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:37,160
color system because I don't think this

00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:39,710
attack comes up that often and I

00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:42,110
definitely had to roll my own life may

00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:45,920
be easy at music make it easy to access

00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:49,550
colors make it easy to find colors and

00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:51,050
some helpers helpers are do lot of this

00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:53,420
here's an example that I was just

00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:58,370
referring to repeat the answer fancy

00:31:53,420 --> 00:32:00,050
pattern is using acceptable names these

00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:02,090
are been great uses on a bunch of

00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:04,850
projects now and it's either to think in

00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:06,920
terms of orchid or poppy or iron or

00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:09,560
mercury as opposed to a gray dark or

00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:12,260
gray light comparing different colors is

00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,730
a little strange and that way I get on

00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:16,580
main spacing my color so I don't have

00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:20,240
any collisions and I'll show you why

00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:24,920
this is awesome you can easily pump out

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:26,360
themes this is my theme codes shoot but

00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:29,060
this is the very simple version of it

00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:30,380
where I am looping through all of my

00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:32,840
different colors in my palette and I'm

00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:34,490
just setting my background color and my

00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:37,520
foreground color which is using my neat

00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:39,350
little helper contrast color again I

00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,640
don't know why frameworks do this

00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:42,980
they've been huge from units in a

00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,360
project some of the ones that this theme

00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:46,430
I think Symantec has some stuff for

00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:49,130
colored man to do I

00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:52,340
there's my contrast function this

00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:54,620
checking the lightness of color and if

00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:58,510
it's light give me a black board round

00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:58,510
if it's dark give me a white foreground

00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:03,080
this this is really great because you

00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:07,430
can you can go ahead and you can take a

00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:10,310
lot of different combinations and span

00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:11,900
new layups layouts up so when we do is

00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:14,570
CMS and this is what we're currently

00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:16,670
doing we have we've given editors the

00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:19,580
ability that to select a feed right just

00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:22,910
I want blue it's just blue or red and

00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:24,200
then we're stuff like this we can go

00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,870
through and make really intelligent

00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,170
decisions

00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:30,120
but I don't know blue on red they do

00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:31,950
something weird you know I mean you can

00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,290
make these a bit more flexible if you

00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:37,800
make your color system configurable it's

00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:41,309
probably not a neat everybody has but if

00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:42,540
you're working in CMS environment or if

00:33:41,309 --> 00:33:44,400
you're handing off code to another

00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:46,410
development team they're gonna get weird

00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,460
requests too so making your color system

00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:49,820
flexible like you've made everything

00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:51,690
else flexible I think helps quite a bit

00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,710
I'm gonna assuming that most of the

00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:54,090
frameworks don't really do this because

00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:55,770
they have theme right if you just

00:33:54,090 --> 00:34:00,570
override a few variables you plug in

00:33:55,770 --> 00:34:04,740
some code and it sort of works but I've

00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:05,760
always liked the idea of making a bit

00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,230
more Pro Matic as well

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,409
programmatic as well since you can

00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:13,710
generate palettes or pretty much

00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:15,560
anything you want to do here's an

00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:21,810
example if you were to apply the theme

00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:24,990
it's really quick all right hot code

00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:27,419
tips and pressure friends avoid

00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:29,820
modifying colors via darken and lighten

00:34:27,419 --> 00:34:32,070
if you're going to do something if

00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:34,020
you're introducing a brand new color or

00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,159
something wholly drastic unless it's

00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,750
something like zebra stripes you're

00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:38,340
alternating something you need a subtle

00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:41,040
gradient or something to make it

00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:42,600
configurable it's a little weird having

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,700
to go through code and find out why

00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,710
something's been modified same thing

00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:48,149
with the best example I can I can give

00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,860
you is that I designed or I've been

00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:52,020
given a lot of components what the

00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:54,780
colors just slightly off and then colors

00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:57,060
on/off it's the opacity no one mentions

00:34:54,780 --> 00:35:00,960
that so just be careful with your

00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:02,460
modifying colors if you're using they're

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,010
using hex to these hex everywhere some

00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:06,210
people I know are using HSL none of the

00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:08,460
frameworks have picked this up it seems

00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:11,190
a bit easier to follow if you're coming

00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:13,440
from a design background that's probably

00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:15,540
hard to follow if you're not probably

00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,280
probably bit more flexible though but

00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:20,940
use 1:1 publish system don't mix them up

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:23,790
and use your code lingo I had mentioned

00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:27,810
using friendly means it does go a long

00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:31,430
way it's a lot easier to say I am using

00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:34,140
orchid and bright word to purple

00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:37,260
say it's fine and you can put a more

00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:41,070
friendly palette my final points since

00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:42,630
most of time it's better to keep things

00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:44,820
really simple and then build a base on

00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:47,430
it I know it sounds kind of dull but

00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:50,280
hear me out your framework doesn't

00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:51,570
really have to be everything and I think

00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,970
for a while some of these frameworks

00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:55,740
were you were a bootstrap site and

00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:56,820
that's all you did and like your site

00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,810
look the same to everyone else does

00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:02,960
anyone you've got a bootstrap theme

00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:05,250
that's wonderful but I don't know that

00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,770
having a site that looks like everyone

00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:09,450
else is always the best thing even

00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:13,680
though it maybe makes things a bit more

00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:16,770
predictable your frameworks to sort of

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,330
get out of the way some extent and

00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:21,870
keeping things pretty simple using

00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:25,440
flexbox using CSS or using calc as I

00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:28,320
mentioned earlier you use your standard

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,910
CSS api's you won't have a lot of weird

00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,270
stuff you have to work around and be

00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:37,800
easier to extend well use big

00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:38,460
configuration over configure can't

00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,070
stress that enough

00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:42,930
if you've worked with bootstrap you know

00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:44,100
or or foundation foundation is really

00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:45,360
bad about it there's definitely some

00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,730
things you just can't change without

00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,930
overriding and it's stuff that you think

00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:53,160
you should logically be able to change

00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:54,930
colors line height font size and borders

00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,990
I know I have all seen in that framework

00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:59,220
where I have to override but everything

00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:00,330
else is configurable already else than

00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:05,970
performance keep variable except for

00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:07,460
this one property I need okay new

00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:11,400
sensible constants

00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:17,680
rounded your base colors and some

00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:20,870
helpers to go for each system that's it

00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,870
[Applause]

00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:30,440
all right we do have time for some

00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:33,770
questions thank you so much Michael you

00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:36,470
mentioned testing yeah one question that

00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:40,640
we haven't yet to solve is you can test

00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:43,339
code how do you test visual Wolf's right

00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:46,069
so Mike and god bolt has a book called

00:37:43,339 --> 00:37:48,349
front-end architecture Mike agon bolt is

00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:49,520
somebody who worked as a front architect

00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,950
who did a bunch of work for Red Hat

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,299
where he explored this problem a lot of

00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:55,339
ways to do it the easiest way that I've

00:37:53,299 --> 00:37:57,440
seen to do it and I one of those things

00:37:55,339 --> 00:38:00,559
they got complex that I had to cut is

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,210
onion skinning so if you've ever used

00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:04,010
cross-browser testing why don't we mean

00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:06,319
browser shot says we're a big fan across

00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:08,329
across a lot of the testing will build a

00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:10,099
kitchen sink page we'll put everything

00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:11,480
on the page a rebuttal layout a couple

00:38:10,099 --> 00:38:14,809
different layouts I'm actually having to

00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,890
do this this week we won't mind this

00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:18,740
being we'll take a screenshot with

00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:20,390
everything and all these services do

00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,770
this now and they overlay them in the

00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:23,930
law say okay what's your base one my

00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:25,130
base one probably is Chrome or something

00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:27,650
and then they'll show me all the

00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:30,799
deviations so you can spot check that

00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:32,779
way there's a way to automate that I'm I

00:38:30,799 --> 00:38:35,539
usually punt that to somebody else who's

00:38:32,779 --> 00:38:36,529
likes to deal with the configuration but

00:38:35,539 --> 00:38:39,730
that's the quickest way that I've done

00:38:36,529 --> 00:38:43,539
it is a good old kitchen sink page and

00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:46,760
building out some real-world scenarios

00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:48,470
automating it yeah I mean that's that's

00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:51,010
a little rough but Mike this if you are

00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:55,010
to make this book does cover that a

00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:58,670
painful detail all right we have one

00:38:55,010 --> 00:39:01,579
time for one more question so I also was

00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:04,430
a verse using CSS frameworks too because

00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:07,160
when I were they were like you know yeah

00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:10,400
asses on it is big right so last year I

00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:12,260
used Suzy by odd Bert have you have you

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,210
ever used that yeah I mentioned

00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:18,319
Smithsonian earlier we did the entire

00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:21,770
bird system Suzy cool back and it was

00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:22,940
really slick I the problem I've sent

00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:24,380
smooth away from it since

00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,150
what's boxes picked it up because it

00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:27,529
just made some of the math I mean that

00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:29,359
was my question because it met the

00:39:27,529 --> 00:39:31,190
author that I'm friends with him and his

00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:33,500
brother and had the same question like

00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:34,730
his whole thing was bridge really aren't

00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,049
that hard it's just a little bit of math

00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:38,089
and

00:39:36,049 --> 00:39:39,469
math and the bugs and courts and that

00:39:38,089 --> 00:39:42,439
sort of worked out and I actually like

00:39:39,469 --> 00:39:44,569
the math not terribly difficult Blas

00:39:42,439 --> 00:39:47,150
that's kind of solved the flexbox or the

00:39:44,569 --> 00:39:48,589
upcoming grid layout system that we

00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:50,719
should be getting in the next year or so

00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:51,799
but yeah Susie Susie so nominal

00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:52,339
especially if you're doing float based

00:39:51,799 --> 00:39:54,079
layouts

00:39:52,339 --> 00:39:56,239
I would absolutely we have a couple

00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,249
slice that are using introduction do you

00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:59,900
would you recommend doing something like

00:39:58,249 --> 00:40:02,179
that where you're using like a utility

00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,739
library you know just math functions

00:40:02,179 --> 00:40:05,269
based on gutter and line height and

00:40:03,739 --> 00:40:11,299
everything yeah rather than use a

00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:12,829
framework because it seems like you

00:40:11,299 --> 00:40:14,299
might have to end up like building a lot

00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:18,549
of things in the framework anyway that

00:40:14,299 --> 00:40:18,549
aren't related to the grid yeah yeah

00:40:18,969 --> 00:40:24,410
there you can definitely go and I

00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:25,910
probably shouldn't Riven this point home

00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:28,549
a little more at night you mention it

00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:32,420
you can definitely go and grab a grid

00:40:28,549 --> 00:40:35,299
system off the shelf and plug it in and

00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:36,589
keep it kind of basic where you might

00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:37,880
get some issues is will fight the

00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:39,559
vertical rhythm stuff that I mentioned

00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,150
but if you're just thinking of your site

00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:42,559
is a bunch of containers and you're

00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:43,670
controlling what's inside of it not

00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:45,140
really a big issue right like you've

00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:49,640
just got two columns or three columns

00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:51,199
where there's a ton of those now they

00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,400
especially ones that are using flexbox I

00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,539
do have some api's and make it a little

00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,829
easier if you're looking for something

00:40:53,539 --> 00:40:56,299
like Suzy and I don't know what a good

00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:58,309
alternative the Suzy would be nowadays

00:40:56,299 --> 00:41:00,469
but this is really good it's been really

00:40:58,309 --> 00:41:03,199
good at doing the math and helping you

00:41:00,469 --> 00:41:04,549
come up with it's gonna have some

00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:06,529
helpers for like how to push stuff

00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:08,719
around which could be really helpful I

00:41:06,529 --> 00:41:10,819
don't know if that correlates that well

00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:13,579
to flexbox much needs I think it

00:41:10,819 --> 00:41:17,119
probably does with margins but yeah it's

00:41:13,579 --> 00:41:18,469
like that piece and you don't feel like

00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,689
doing the math or rolling your own or

00:41:18,469 --> 00:41:22,699
framework so heavy yeah there's a ton of

00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:24,380
those and I would definitely go grab

00:41:22,699 --> 00:41:25,429
that and plug that in the other ones are

00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,949
a little bit harder to swap out for

00:41:25,429 --> 00:41:29,239
there's tons of grids

00:41:26,949 --> 00:41:31,039
awesome well Michael I'm sure there are

00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:33,170
other questions in the room so if people

00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:35,710
want to ask a conversation going you'll

00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:37,660
be here all week yeah

00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:40,880
cool thanks

00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:40,880
[Applause]
