advancement what what does that mean

00:00:54,770 --> 00:01:02,450
so Jago project has two paid contractors

00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:04,579
me and Tim Graham you probably are more

00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:08,329
familiar with Tim's work he is the one

00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:11,479
who makes Jango go do you know about the

00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:13,880
Jango Software Foundation the DSF is the

00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:16,670
nonprofit that's behind Jango that

00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,929
administers Jango we're run by a board

00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,929
of directors

00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:23,450
Frank Wiles Daniela who organized Jango

00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:26,179
Khan Europe last year James Bennett

00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:28,520
Karen Tracy Rebecca Conley is our new

00:01:26,179 --> 00:01:30,079
secretary and Christophe is our

00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,139
treasurer I work really closely with him

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:37,130
and then there are the two of us your

00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:40,329
Django staff this is Tim getting your

00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:45,259
issues that's actually how he gets them

00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:47,090
and me just the two of us so the DSM is

00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:48,979
the nonprofit behind Jango and our main

00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:51,350
focus is the direct support of Django's

00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:53,630
developers this means organizing and

00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:56,179
funding sprints we often sponsor the

00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,829
Sprint's at conferences helping both

00:01:56,179 --> 00:02:00,380
attend the sprints getting to a

00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:02,359
conference is expensive so we provide

00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:05,090
grants for that we provide financial

00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:07,759
assistance to Gengo girls we fund the

00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:11,599
Jango fellowship program which is Tim's

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:14,450
work that's Tim trying to make something

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:18,380
close to a real developer salary making

00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:20,629
Jango happen so here's a little bit of

00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:23,120
Tim's work at a glance just based on

00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:24,739
what I pulled down from our recent posts

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,190
about his work

00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:32,580
he does a lot before we contracted with

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:35,400
Tim officially about a year ago um as

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,230
the February release just happened when

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,790
they happened Tim keeps them on a

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,769
regular schedule and he keeps the

00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:44,580
community updated about what's happening

00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:46,260
he's a hugely valuable asset to us you

00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,940
want some more you can join the Django

00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,410
developers mailing list and get his

00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,650
weekly updates about what he's working

00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,750
on in February he was renewed for

00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:57,180
another six months of funding until

00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,610
September of this year and he would love

00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,340
to keep going but we need the funding to

00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,170
make it happen we also want to keep

00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,209
making a difference for Django girls in

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,190
junior girls Poland last year we

00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:09,510
supported them four times and they said

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,069
that when they approached different

00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,530
local companies about their workshops

00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:15,840
the companies didn't really understand

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,959
why it was important but the DSF made it

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,870
possible so there are some ways you can

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,959
get involved and we need you yes you in

00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,700
this storm we need you there are some

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,799
different ways you can get involved you

00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,540
can become a corporate member if your

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,450
company is built with Django if you use

00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,950
Django show support to Django as a

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,750

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,389
of membership silver gold and platinum

00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,590
there are tons of benefits including

00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:42,120
badges that you can put on your website

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,530
that's something that the community have

00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,959
been asking for for a while and we made

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,340
happen so I just want to give a shout

00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,290
out to some of our current corporate

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,420
members there are three slides so take a

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,549
look look and see if you see your

company on here if you don't see your

00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:58,940
company on these slides we need to talk

00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,940
let's talk

do you more were you up there let's talk

00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:20,269
all right now this is something everyone

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,580
can become you can become a leadership

00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:23,990
level donor this is a big commitment to

00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:27,470
Django when you think about it this is

00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:30,770
giving $1,000 or more per year in a

00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,660
calendar year you get a logo or a

00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,370

it's just what everyone goes to and you

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:39,230
get a special badge that you can use

00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:41,419
wherever you like so leadership level

00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,370
don't donations may seem big but the

00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:46,190
cool thing is they can be recurring we

00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:49,250
make it easy to give on a schedule so if

00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:51,590
you give $100 a month to Django for a

00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,930
year you become a leadership level donor

00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,460
so why not do that we have a number of

00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,979

00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:15,169
fold by the end of this week and if that

00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:17,539
sounds a little nutty to you keep in

00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:21,289
mind we've done this before when we

00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:25,479
launched in January of 2015 in six days

00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:27,800
this community gave $30,000 in six days

00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:28,939
that's what we're doing let's make it

00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,449
happen and let's stay in touch

00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:31,449
thanks

00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:53,500
I am every bottle of a modern Django

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,870
mobile for my handle any infant even the

00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,160
emoji in cuneiform I got I got nada Hemi

00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,080
access through an elegant and mature

00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,450
form in rails pylons PHP they look upon

00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,040
me with forlorn some criticize the white

00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:04,300
space in my language with a lot of scorn

00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,010
but when you are quite used to this you

00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,090
probably think yours is here the norm or

00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:10,210
building site you'll probably end up

00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:11,440
building lots and lots of views to

00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,610
service all the shopping carts and

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,610
sometimes even read the news

00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:26,070
your design assets will be safely stored

00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,900
out there aesthetic files the pretty is

00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,310
completed by the use of sub cascading

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,350
starboard while about their handling all

00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:34,100
that emoji and cuneiform I'm still the

00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,100
very model of a modern

00:07:39,349 --> 00:07:43,620
my models can be entered into any modern

00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:45,900
database but really you should use

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,460
Postgres like anybody will taste atomic

00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,470
transactions then let me handle failures

00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,780
with good grace I 18 Annan LT man min I

00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,039
can run in any place

00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,690
what's her escaping by default helps

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,099
topple over the egg on face and future

00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,110
errors are prevented with a sturdy

00:07:56,099 --> 00:08:01,680
testing base but nothing can protect you

00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:03,180
from a dip up who is feeling smug who

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,539
edits in production and then introduces

00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,539
Boston

00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:15,520
and that's why yours you share all

00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:17,499
Mossad should have a comprehensive

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,389
monitoring scheme alerting to activities

00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:20,979
of hackers who are being mean it's still

00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:22,659
about their handling all that emoji and

00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:25,680
cuneiform because I am the model of a

00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:25,680
modern jagger models

00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:36,240
hopefully you can use me anyway that you

00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:38,310
are wanting to with comprehensive

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,680
documents to assist when you have no

00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:42,779
clue supported by a friendly group of

00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,670
worldwide Django users who gladly

00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,890
volunteer their time for mentoring and

00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:49,170
helping you with a building up

00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:51,540
migrations or figuring out a class-based

00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:54,510
view or deploying a server on a platform

00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,160

spend a few minutes talking about the

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,730
collaborative funding model that we've

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,070
recently launched

00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:19,890
so before I start can I ask everybody in

00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:22,170
the room if you or the company that you

00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:27,209
work for uses Django rest framework in

00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:28,800
some capacity can you oh wow okay and if

00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,450
you or the company that you work for

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,339
currently funds one of the rest room

00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:38,600
will pay plans can you put your hand up

00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:42,199
please okay that's what needs to change

00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:46,620
okay so here's the good news

00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:49,199
yeah a few weeks back I quit my regular

00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,899
employment and started working on rest

00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:55,440
frame work full-time the result of this

00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:57,839
so far there's a huge slew of bugs and

00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,560
tickets they're being closed we've had

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,660
the three point four release out just

00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,839
last week complete with schema

00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:09,660
generation the Python client library for

00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:11,610
interacting with your api's and the

00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,649
command-line tool for interacting with

00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:15,600
your api's and this functionality is

00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:17,370
also going to start to open up a lot of

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,010
other interesting possibilities as it

00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:25,320
matures and there's an absolute huge

00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:27,870
stack of work that is coming next on top

00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,390
of this as well so there's going to be a

00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:32,850
hypermedia support coming up I have

00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:36,170
plans for real-time support using

00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:38,190
WebSockets coming up more mature

00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,899
authentication defaults in rest

00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:43,350
framework so to help you build more

00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:45,750
secure ap is helping you get into

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:48,300
production faster by providing templates

00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,730
that allow you to get your API up and

00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,420
running

00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,870
in production and next and outside what

00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,970
else

00:11:52,870 --> 00:12:00,730
so client libraries in hopefully you

00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:07,269
know as we go forward JavaScript's I hat

00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:12,720
go Java Swift improved tooling for API

00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:15,370
documentation as well as monitoring

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,230
debugging all sorts of things that we

00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:20,290
can work on I can see you know there's

00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:22,329
at least two or three person years worth

00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:26,430
of work that I can already see from here

00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:31,449
so I can't do this without your help and

00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:33,670
I think that the core thing that I want

00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:36,100
to say about this talk is trying to make

00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:38,860
the business case for funding whether

00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:42,029
it's or you know hopefully both the

00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:46,810
Django fellowship and the rest framework

00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:48,399
paid plans and the key here to me is I

00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:50,410
think that this is something worthwhile

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,779
because I think it's in your best

00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,699
interests to do so like this is the

00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:58,180
pitch I want to make to the businesses

00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:59,800
because it's absolutely clear - you know

00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:02,769
it should be clear to everybody that a

00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:05,730
well invested open-source ecosystem

00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:10,329
represents a huge competitive advantage

00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:13,029
to your companies okay and also although

00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:15,130
the collaborative funding model is a

00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:16,889
kind of new business model and slightly

00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:21,760
atypical I think it's really compelling

00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:25,870
because look at it this way around so

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:29,440
myself Adrian and Tim we want to work

00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:31,329
for your companies full-time and there's

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,000
one problem there's one con

00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:36,029
the catch is we're only going to work on

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,079
these open source projects that you use

00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:43,000
nothing else the pro is our company you

00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:46,029
only have to pay us a small fraction of

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:50,769
a full-time salary right that sounds

00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:52,120
like a good deal to me so if I'm asking

00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:53,589
for your money I think it's very

00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,220
important to be transparent about

00:13:53,589 --> 00:14:01,089
exactly what I'm asking for I'm looking

00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:02,030
for about sixty five thousand dollars a

00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:04,880
year in order

00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:08,270
to make this viable so it's not a that's

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:11,450
revenue not salary so this isn't some

00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:14,900
huge money skimp money spinning scheme

00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:18,730
but it is enough to support a viable

00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:21,470
business okay where we are at the moment

00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:23,330
we're starting to get close to the

00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:27,920
tipping point right

00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:30,520
getting to the 100% funded level is the

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:34,160
thing that will change all of this and

00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:36,470
we're starting to get there so here's

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:40,130
the money shot

00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:43,700
the plans starts the corporate plans

00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:46,910
start at $50 a month okay and every

00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:49,790
single one of those makes a significant

00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:52,070
difference from my side every single one

00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:56,030
and I want to make it clear this is an

00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:59,930
investment not a donation okay so if

00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:01,730
your company's considering funding you

00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,710
know get in touch with me I will happily

00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,150
help you talk with your business owner

00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,220
about trying to make the case for

00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:09,490
funding it thank you very much for your

00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,490
time

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,160
my name is Trey I have a lot of

00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:21,890
experience with workshops and tutorials

00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,090
and with lightning talks until this

00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:25,220
morning I had virtually no experience

00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:30,260
giving a talk longer than five minutes

00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:32,510
and less than three hours so I'm going

00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,520
to share with you some tips that I hope

00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:37,220
will help inspire you to give your first

00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:39,380
lightning talk when thinking up a topic

00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:42,140
remember that you want to deliver value

00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,910
to your audience so that can mean

00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,560
reviewing a familiar concept it can mean

00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:47,150
teaching folks a new skill you could

00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,980
shed light on a topic that's a little

00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,830
new or unfamiliar you could also

00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,690
entertain people with a fun story

00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:57,040
you can talk really broadly about a

00:15:53,690 --> 00:16:00,620
topic or just barely introduce it you

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,210
could you could dive into a topic that's

00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,650
really niche that only a handful of the

00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:07,370
people in your audience know about

00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:10,280
that's okay when you make a lightning

00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:12,140
talk use an outline make a bulleted list

00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,820
of points that you'll cover and hone

00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:16,490
that list down to something that fits in

00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,560
five minutes the first thing you want to

00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:20,840
do is set expectations if there's

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,220
background information necessary review

00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,360
it or state that it's needed so that

00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,520
people know whether or not they're in

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,620
your target audience you only need one

00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:30,200
take away for a five minute lighting

00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:32,780
talk the fewer the takeaways the better

00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,370
and don't be afraid to cut things out

00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:37,040
because you can always elaborate more

00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:39,050
later keep it simple

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,150
limit the number of variables to

00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:43,490
decrease the likelihood that things

00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:45,620
could go wrong for your first lighting

00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:48,890
talk use slides don't use too many

00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,510
slides and don't try a live demo live

00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,740
demos are really hard to pull off so

00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,150
don't even try the first time you do a

00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:56,000
lightning talk you can always show demos

00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:57,650
to people after the talk when showing

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,150
code blocks make sure people can read

00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:01,840
the code on a projector in a well-lit

00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:04,010
room use dark text on a light background

00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:06,560
don't use white text on a black

00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:07,790
background that looks cool on your

00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,050
computer when you're coding late at

00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,670
night it's kind of hard to read on a

00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:13,670
projector based on the way projector

00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:15,320
technology kind of works also make your

00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:17,420
font size big so that people can make

00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,220
read it in the back of the room and make

00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:25,100
sure not to put too much stuff on each

00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:27,049
slide write speaker notes edit and

00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,570
re-edit those speaker notes and

00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:31,159
script your talk as much as you can you

00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,720
may or may not have noticed it but I am

00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:34,399
entirely reading off of my speaker notes

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,009
and that's pretty much what I was doing

00:17:34,399 --> 00:17:38,739
this morning when I gave my talk as well

00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:41,029
there is no shame in scripting your talk

00:17:38,739 --> 00:17:42,909
it's nice to have your speaker notes

00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:45,409
memorized but it's not essential

00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:47,720
performances are fun and performances

00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:49,489
are scripted ideally remove

00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,289
non-essential parts that you notice

00:17:49,489 --> 00:17:54,049
while rehearsing in the worst case

00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:56,239
scenario you have if you have like 80%

00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:58,369
of your talk left and 30 seconds to go

00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:59,720
what is that 10 second takeaway phrase

00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:04,090
that you can deliver before you say

00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:05,950
thank you very much when you get to the

00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:08,749
towards that five-minute time limit

00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:13,489
limit make sure to panic

00:18:08,749 --> 00:18:15,350
sorry don't panic if you're ending too

00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:17,929
soon give people your 10 second pitch

00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:21,739
and move to questions or you know end it

00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:23,359
right there after your talk is over take

00:18:21,739 --> 00:18:25,609
a deep breath and congratulate yourself

00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,929
if you are an introvert like I am you

00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:28,309
just broke the ice you gave everyone

00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:29,960
else something to talk to you about

00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:31,840
afterwards a reason to find you

00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:37,480
somewhere else at the conference and

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,480
introduce themselves to you that's it

00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:46,389
cool so I talked some grass

00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:55,500
okay so how many of you frequented the

00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:03,940
can y'all hear me fantastic yeah great

00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:06,190
so on if you frequented it in the past

00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,290
six months you probably saw that it's

00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,840
going down the people that were running

00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:13,900
that will and Sheila they're just tired

00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,310
they want to move on and there was a

00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,870
bunch of people that stepped up to say

00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,320
hey let's keep this thing going it's

00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,380
great

00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,700
personally it's where I learned a lot of

00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,920
awesome things about Python and did

00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,000
studying on my own while I was working

00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:30,820
out or doing the dishes or whatever

00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:32,800
choice I had so I ended up being the

00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,080
only person left after a lot of people

00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,370
said hey we can help out I ended up

00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,760
being the only person left that had

00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:42,040
built a site in time for PyCon and now

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,600
we have a while I was at PyCon I got a

00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,180
bunch of people together to continue

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,260
work on that project it's not built in

00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,120
Django sorry

00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,560
----builtin Pelican a static site

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,540
generator but it is hosted on github

00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:55,450
which makes it super lightweight super

00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:58,240
cheap to run and what I'm here to do is

00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,800
to tell you that one it exists we're

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,770
always looking for help

00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:05,740
we are moving really fast and getting

00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:07,810
new talks out on two pi tube Syfy is

00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,970
already up Syfy ended a few days ago

00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:14,800
it's already up four for your viewing

00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:16,720
pleasure and if you have any questions

00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:21,100
or want to talk about contributing back

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,510
feel free to Twitter me at Paul Logsdon

00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:30,250
or just come up to me and talk to me

00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:32,530
during the conference Thanks all right

00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,270
if I was better prepared and not quite

00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:36,070
this busy I would have probably done

00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:39,310
slides but we're gonna make there with

00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:42,670
what we can hear so who has heard of any

00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:44,200
ACK all right awesome Eenie ack with the

00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:46,420
first electronic computer in the world

00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:49,150
and it was made right here on Penn's

00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:51,460
campus and there are parts of it four

00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:54,429
blocks away from here so if you came all

00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:58,090
this way and you're a geek don't leave

00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:59,350
without seeing in yet so here are a

00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,660
couple things

00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:04,570
Eenie AK all the original programmers of

00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:08,470
eeny AK were women men considered it

00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:09,940
beneath them but not only not only was

00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,410
the first programming language ever

00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:14,140
designed designed by women all the

00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:17,320
initial programmers of ENIAC were women

00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:19,630
so go to django girls by a code like a

00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,850
girl t-shirt and use it in the picture

00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:24,039
you're going to take with any AK find a

00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:28,780
new friend somebody you don't know and

00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:31,450
make the walk Felicia Day gave a keynote

00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:34,450
here a couple years ago you may know her

00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:36,370
from web series like the guild or TV

00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,770
shows like supernatural and a bunch of

00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:40,990
other things that are out there

00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:43,570
she was pretty psyched and this got

00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:45,159
retweeted many times I am working to try

00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,510
to get in touch with the curator of e

00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:49,419
niak we've gone back and forth a couple

00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:51,280
times to find a time when you could

00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:53,770
actually open up the entire display so

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,450
we could do some photo ops like this so

00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:57,940
if you want to chance at that keep an

00:21:55,450 --> 00:22:01,299
eye on my Twitter it may be last minute

00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:03,450
I'm twitter.com slash flipper pa flipper

00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:05,320
like the dolphin PA like Pennsylvania

00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:07,150
because I'm hoping to put that together

00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,440
to get a couple people some shots like

00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,090
this which are really cool you can

00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,390
actually see the vacuum tubes and

00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:17,650
everything it took to make four whole K

00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:19,570
of memory if you need directions from

00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:23,350
here to there it is incredibly complex

00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:26,080
you are at 3730 Walnut Street it is a

00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:28,390
seven minute walk to 3300 Walnut Street

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,840
where you see the pin you can walk down

00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:34,270
to 33rd Street turn right and the first

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,730
entrance on 33rd Street on your right is

00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:41,200
the ENIAC display there is a signpost

00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:45,309
outside on 33rd Street that says Beauty

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:48,010
ACK so go see e niak if you get a chance

00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:51,100
it's absolutely awesome this is Paul

00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:57,070
Shaffer the curator he is not the guy

00:22:51,100 --> 00:23:00,010
from David Letterman also at 37th and

00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:01,630
Ludlow that is if you go down to 37th

00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:04,750
Street and turn left there's a walkway

00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:08,980
in between chestnut and Market aka on

00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:11,950
the way to Han Dynasty well here you can

00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,899
see the monument where in 2015 we in

00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,990
ducted the original six women of Eenie

00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:19,090
act to our technology walk of fame here

00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:21,370
at Penn which is a pretty big deal this

00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:24,340
is one of my favorite spots on Penguin's

00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:25,809
campus and it was long overdue that we

00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:28,809
credited these six pioneering

00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:31,899
programmers with the honors they all

00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:34,960
deserved so blatant arts don't have to

00:23:31,899 --> 00:23:36,340
be five full minutes mine is not keep

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,019
that in mind for the next time you give

00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:41,639
a lightning talk you can do it in 30

00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:41,639
