	Building JSON APIS With Django / Pinax by Brian Rosner

Javascript is a language we simply cannot ignore. It isn't just Javascript too. Objective-C, Swift and Java are all languages we are finding we need to work with to meet client expectations about a web app.

The role Django (and Python) plays in this new world is becoming a bit more limited. There are plenty of great efforts to get Python running everywhere, but this talk isn't about any of that. This talk is about building the API all of these frontends need to communicate with to drive persistent and business logic.

pinax-api was originally built to serve the needs of a particular client at Eldarion, but later pulled out as its own app. It provides a simple and modern interface to building an API with Django. At its core, pinax-api leverages the JSON:API spec that was built out of Ember.

The talk will cover:

what is JSON:API
JSON:API in pinax-api
API primitives provided by pinax-pai
how pinax-api leverages Django to its fullest
automatic documentation generation using API Blueprint
why not Django REST Framework?
