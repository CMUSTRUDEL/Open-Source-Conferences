	The Fraud Police are Coming: Work, Leadership, and Imposter Syndrome by Amanda Clark

What is imposter syndrome?

It's a failure to internalize your accomplishments. It's the nagging feeling you don't know enough, haven't done enough, don't have enough experience to do your job, land a new account, publish a new paper. It's feeling like a fraud and that you're about to be found out. The term was coined in a study by Pauline Rose Clance & Suzanne Imes in 1978 having to do with the habits and behaviors of high-achieving women, but it's recently become a hot topic in tech and career conversations - with good reason.

Who does it affect?

Originally a phenomenon studied among women in academic fields, studies (and anecdotal evidence) have shown it affects just about everyone. Sheryl Sandberg, Meryl Streep, and Maya Angelou have all commented about their own experiences with imposter syndrome. After we've asked, so have most of our friends and colleagues. We combine research with personal experience to provide the Big Six signs you might have imposter syndrome, so you can recognize the symptoms in yourself.

How is it affecting me?

Imposter syndrome can make us feel like we need to be super-people, adding and adding to our goals each day, with no end in sight. It means we might be less likely to raise our hands for new projects because we don't think we know enough. It might keep us from speaking up in meetings, seeking promotions, or talking at conferences. It can bring feelings of self-doubt, anxiety, fear, alienation, isolation, shame or despair. It can be paralyzing to a person's career.

Does it get better?

Thanks to the Dunning-Kruger effect, the more you learn, the more you realize how much you don't know. When combined with the imposter syndrome associated with increasing achievements over time, it usually gets worse.

But...there's good news.

Through identifying specific components of imposter syndrome, you can sort out what's a real area for improvement and what's mostly anxiety. Dealing with imposter syndrome is often part of the price of doing new, exciting things. We can help you figure out to cope. This talk will also help you recognize imposter syndrome in friends, colleagues, and employees, and we'll help you think about how to best support them. (Hint: responding with compliments does more harm than good.) By the end of our talk, you'll to learn how you can leverage the feelings of imposter syndrome to become a better leader, colleague and human.

so tweet away so how did we get here to

be talking to all of you about imposter

00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:49,760
syndrome today it started with me

00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:52,190
getting mad on the internet I really

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,829
enjoy reading career advice articles and

00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:57,220
I had been seeing a lot of them about

00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:59,660
impostor syndrome a couple years ago I

00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,700
read them and I read them and it wasn't

00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,360
that impostor syndrome didn't seem real

00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,729
to me

00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:08,240
it was that the advice didn't seem good

00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:10,130
and so I started talking to people

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,100
I started tweeting about it I talked to

00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:15,880
Amanda about it and this was a couple of

00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:20,020
days before BarCamp filly in November

00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:22,159
and Amanda kind of strong-armed me into

00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,679
co-presenting a talk on impostor

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,929
syndrome which I might add I did not

00:01:24,679 --> 00:01:30,729
want to give because I did not feel

00:01:26,929 --> 00:01:30,729
qualified to speak on the subject

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,530
so we started talking last November as

00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:39,920
briana mentioned at a bar and i feel

00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,329
like we haven't stopped since I really

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,819
learned a pot about impostor syndrome

00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:46,130
that night and identified really

00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:48,560
strongly with it I just dove in I

00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,899
learned as much as I could we read as

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,609
much as we could

00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:54,829
between our conversation and bark and

00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:57,770
filly and when it came time to present

00:01:54,829 --> 00:02:00,429
we told people what we knew and then we

00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:03,399
sat back and waited for questions and we

00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:06,319
got a lot of people telling us stories

00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:08,720
then and throughout the rest of the past

00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:11,750
seven or eight months people that were

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,400
feeling this way too and I just felt in

00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,650
Brianna I know feels that it's so

00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,610
important to talk about this so we're so

00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,260
excited to be having this conversation

00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:23,049
again today with you

00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:27,010
all right so to start what is impostor

00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:29,980
syndrome the term was coined in 1978 by

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:33,430
pauline Rosecrans and suzanne iams who

00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:36,250
did the groundbreaking research on what

00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,900
impostor syndrome was they initially did

00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,700
a study among high achieving women and

00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:43,030
they defined it as a failure to

00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,980
internalize accomplishments it doesn't

00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,750
particularly sound meaningful the way

00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,689
that we like to describe it is the

00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:52,000
nagging feeling that you are over

00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:58,209
esteemed under qualified and on the

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,500
verge of being found out as a fraud so

00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:00,940
we wanted to keep having this

00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,049
conversation because not everyone knows

00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,639
the term even though they might be

00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:05,799
feeling it so if you've already

00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:08,920
self-identified and you're in good

00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:13,109
company just look around you guess who

00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:15,700
else feels like an impostor this guy

00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:17,859
Einstein was quoted as saying the

00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,260
exaggerated esteem in which my life work

00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:23,260
is held makes me feel very ill at ease I

00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:28,299
feel compelled to think of myself as an

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:31,180
involuntary swindler Maya Angelou said

00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:34,209
I've written 11 books but each time I

00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,730
think oh they're going to find out now

00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:40,269
I've run a game on everybody and they're

00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:43,810
going to find me out now we have dirty

00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:45,579
foster confident actress who's been in

00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:48,160
tons of movies when she won her first

00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:50,680
Academy Award she was quoted as saying

00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,480
she thought it was a fluke it was the

00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,190
same way when I walked out on the campus

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,680
at Yale I thought everyone would find

00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:58,540
out they'd take the Oscar back they'd

00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,010
come to my house knocking on my door and

00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:04,480
say we meant that for someone else

00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:06,010
we meant that for Meryl Streep Meryl

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,720
Streep said I don't know how to act

00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:12,370
anyway so why am I doing this the point

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,290
is that we've heard about impostor

00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,510
syndrome from people and basically every

00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:18,340
profession that we've talked to

00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,650
professors researchers programmers

00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:23,590
bankers real estate agents designers

00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:26,169
people in every stage of illustrious

00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:28,930
careers all of them share similar

00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:33,340
stories in fact some research shows that

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:35,530
about 70% of people suffer from impostor

00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,690
syndrome I personally think that might

00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:40,180
be an underestimate because this is 70%

00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:47,440
of people studied who admitted that they

00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:48,490
have symptoms of imposter syndrome when

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,650
originally those studies were done

00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,110
imposter syndrome was thought to be a

00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:55,120
phenomenon that was present mostly in

00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,250
women high achieving academic women as

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,320
Breanna mentioned as time has gone on

00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:05,110
it's clear that it affects people in

00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:08,020
every age race gender industry often it

00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,490
affects male imposters doubly because

00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,010
they're already feeling like an impostor

00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,970
in their role and then they feel like

00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,990
they shouldn't be having these feelings

00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:18,130
anyway so it's like imposter times too

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,690
right there's that high achieving women

00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,820
in research that we talked about at the

00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,590
beginning and part of what was

00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,479
interesting about that and part of what

00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:28,930
led to more research being done among

00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:30,910
women exclusively was that part of the

00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,970
identification for imposter syndrome was

00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:36,460
rooted in gender roles but as time has

00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,979
gone on not only have we seen how this

00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,810
affects people from all genders but also

00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:42,580
how it affects people who are different

00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:48,010
minorities in whatever context they're a

00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:51,669
minority in for any of you with us so

00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:54,490
far you know the feelings you know

00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:57,130
you're not alone next up are some big

00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,440
indicators that you might relate to even

00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:02,620
if you haven't yet so we're going to

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,990
talk about the big six and these are big

00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:08,470
six big factors that were identified by

00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,970
researchers so koku and alexander when

00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:13,090
they wrote the paper called the imposter

00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:17,380
phenomenon first of the big six is the

00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:19,990
imposter cycle and we've found out the

00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:22,500
imposter cycle just take it in feel like

00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:25,270
the emojis speak louder than words but

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,550
we'll go through the words anyway so it

00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:31,360
begins up here with a new project or

00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:33,610
task could be big or small can be a

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,729
little exciting but what that excitement

00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:40,720
can immediately come anxiety self-doubt

00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:43,750
and worry creeping in so you have to

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,320
begin and oftentimes you begin with

00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:50,380
furious over preparation for hours

00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:53,380
hours days upon days sometimes also

00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:55,690
procrastination also for hours or days

00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,730
upon days the thing is these two things

00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:00,940
can also come hand-in-hand they can both

00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:04,660
be happening simultaneously on the same

00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:07,570
day inevitably because you're smart and

00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:10,480
you're talented you accomplish the goal

00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:12,400
you achieve something and it's

00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,230
immediately a feeling of relief you're

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,700
like okay it's done it's off my plate

00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:20,440
this is great I can move on but then you

00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,360
start getting feedback even if the

00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,660
feedback is overwhelmingly positive

00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,180
great feedback you're still in your head

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:31,120
potentially discounting this feedback as

00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:33,790
either luck like I just got lucky this

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,180
wasn't really meant to happen or it's

00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,800
over

00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,630
you're looking at the over preparation

00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,820
and thinking how you expended so much

00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:41,680
effort more effort than maybe your peers

00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,940
would have had to expend that if you'd

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,980
spent more time in it it would have been

00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,360
even better but essentially it's

00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,520
bringing you back around to that

00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,120
increased sense of fraudulence the

00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:54,610
feelings of anxiety and self-doubt

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,890
so as a case study for the imposter

00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,820
cycle I like to use our own talks on

00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,820
impostor syndrome

00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:02,380
I apologize at how many this is I hope

00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:06,310
everybody has had enough caffeine to

00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:08,200
deal with us but starting off in the new

00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,700
project or task I'm going to start off

00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,970
with the talk the version of this talk

00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:14,940
that we did in January at Panama in

00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,230
another room in this very building

00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:21,130
because the BarCamp talk was such a

00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:22,660
last-minute ordeal but for that one we

00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:25,600
had a good two months that we knew what

00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:28,000
we were up against and so the anxiety

00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,760
and the self-doubt and the worry all

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,080
started to come into play as soon as we

00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,300
felt that there might be some

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,669
expectations as for the quality of our

00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,290
imposter syndrome talk there had been

00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:40,240
some people at the off-the-cuff one we

00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:42,550
did at bar camp but for those of you who

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,950
have not been to a bar camp expectations

00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:46,390
tend to be relatively low it's a an

00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,550
unconference where you decide what the

00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:51,160
programming is the day of and so it's

00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:53,860
very casual in terms of giving talks

00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:57,790
this was going to be an actual talk that

00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:59,380
people came just to see so naturally we

00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,410
jumped straight in to the

00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:04,129
procrastination

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:07,060
/ / preparation phase for me that looked

00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:09,740
like going through my college alumni

00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:11,839
jstor account and looking at every

00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,509
single possible thing I could find on

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,490
imposter syndrome imposters impostor

00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:19,639
phenomenon and every variation thereof

00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:24,290
and then also watching a lot of Parks

00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:26,029
and Rec and West Wing I was also doing

00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,769
that this weekend if you look at my

00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:31,100
Instagram my Twitter feeds you'll see

00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:32,689
this cycle wonderfully Illustrated like

00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,430
many people I switch back and forth

00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:37,610
between the procrastinate and the over

00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:40,069
preparation one very very frequently you

00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,360
may have experienced this yourself then

00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:43,009
after the talk that was the

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,379
accomplishment people said we did a

00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:46,939
pretty good job at it and I just

00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:49,639
discounted the feedback on that right

00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:53,420
there people enjoyed it not said we did

00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:55,310
a pretty good job on it and then we felt

00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,779
a little bit of anxiety about how when

00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,850
if it was just because people never

00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:00,319
heard of impostor syndrome before and it

00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,839
was their introduction of the concept

00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:04,880
and after that you were rewarded with

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,100
another project or task usually one

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,529
that's slightly heavier or slightly more

00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:18,439
difficult than the task before it in

00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:20,779
this case here we are here alright so

00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:22,160
number two of the big six and they're

00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:24,889
all much shorter after the first one I

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:29,389
assure you the need to be special or the

00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:32,540
very best this manifestation of imposter

00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:35,180
syndrome is the one that keeps you as a

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:37,130
big fish in a small pond or where you

00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,529
focus on other people's perceptions of

00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:43,850
you rather than your own perception of

00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:47,750
how hard you worked the next is the

00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,949
quest to be superhuman and I know many

00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,110
of you may know this but our

00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:53,420
expectations of ourselves are often a

00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:56,389
lot greater than the people around us

00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:58,939
half of us our colleagues our friends

00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:00,709
our loved ones even our bosses with our

00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:03,550
jobs we often set these really

00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:07,490
aggressive sometimes unrealistic

00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:10,160
sometimes superhuman yes goals for us

00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,990
and at home we often double these

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,790
expectations trying to tick a hundred

00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,280
things off of our to-do list and

00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:18,080
get more to that later the quest to

00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:21,530
always be doing more and the eventual

00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:23,000
burnout leaves us feeling like a fake if

00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:25,310
I were really good at my job I could

00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:31,340
handle all of this and even though this

00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:35,470
might be too much fear of failure who

00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:37,400
has heard the phrase fail fast before

00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:43,220
anybody ever noticed how they really

00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:45,710
under self sucks to fail we talk a lot

00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:47,900
about failing fast and failing big but

00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:50,060
falling on your face sucks especially

00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:53,690
when you're constantly rewarded for

00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:55,670
doing well on a task by having to

00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:58,130
perform on a larger and larger stage or

00:11:55,670 --> 00:12:00,290
in front of more people and this also

00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:01,370
leads into fearing success which is

00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:04,990
something that we'll talk about in a

00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:08,170
little bit more next is the denial of

00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:10,760
confidence or the discounting of praise

00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:14,330
when we describe our accomplishments

00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:17,780
with words like just or merely or only

00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:19,610
or minimizing them and when we're

00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:22,550
complimented under work and praised for

00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:25,040
our skills and we say well it could have

00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:30,470
been better or you see I just got lucky

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:32,510
or thanks but we're feeling fraudulent

00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:35,180
and thinking that discounting this

00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:36,710
praise is making us more humble and if

00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,720
we just accepted it it might feel like

00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:40,100
cheating unfortunately you're also

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,690
telling the person praising you that

00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:46,520
they're wrong and that's not great

00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:49,430
either the last of the big six is here

00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:51,760
and guilt about success this manifests

00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:54,380
in a few different ways one of them is

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,120
not wanting to become successful in case

00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,940
you fail which is tied to number four

00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,490
there's also guilt about success that's

00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,410
related to did I deserve this should I

00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,660
have been the one to get this and also

00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:07,280
create distance when you're spending

00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,930
time with people who are close to you

00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,240
who didn't succeed in the same way that

00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:13,670
you did you see this sometimes with

00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,380
first-generation college students where

00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,910
there's some distance that's created

00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:20,090
between them and the rest of their

00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:22,670
family so

00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:25,330
did anybody identify with any of those

00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:27,590
big six and

00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,550
they might not raise your hand because

00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:33,110
you wanted to see what everybody else

00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:35,030
was gonna do all right so what we're

00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:38,030
going to do is we're gonna take about 30

00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:40,280
seconds to sit here and if one of them

00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:43,190
rang through you or all of them rang

00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:47,030
trigger you and take a minute to write

00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:49,520
down or make a note of one thing that

00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:50,810
you would like to do that feeling like

00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:55,600
an impostor has been holding you back

00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:57,640
from assuming you've all written down

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,510
the one thing that you feel like

00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:02,630
impostor syndrome is holding you back

00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:06,200
from will get into the next topic which

00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:08,090
is it gets better right and we have some

00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,860
news that may not be easy to hear but it

00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,570
might might make sense to some of you

00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,190
who are further along in your career and

00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:15,800
who may have experienced these feelings

00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:18,110
for a while and that is the more that

00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,960
you know the less you think you know and

00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:22,250
Briana will explain more so some of you

00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,930
may have heard of the dunning-kruger

00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,830
effect and this is kind of what this is

00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:27,080
about

00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:30,190
Dunning Kruger Dunning and Kruger did

00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:33,380
research on perceived competence levels

00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:35,690
basically here's an illustration than by

00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:38,120
Jessica Hagee from this is indexed that

00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:40,580
shows the more education you have about

00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,230
a given subject the more you know and

00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,970
also the more education that you get on

00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:51,410
a given subject the more you know you

00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:54,530
don't know so when you're starting to

00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:56,360
learn something new you might think that

00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:58,040
you're a rock star immediately an

00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,200
example of this that comes to mind for

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:04,550
me is the first time I sat down and

00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:07,220
tried to learn some HTML and I remember

00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:10,550
the feeling when I got something to say

00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:13,100
hello world on a page that I made and I

00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:17,590
was so proud like I can make so many

00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:20,450
websites hundreds of websites a day and

00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:22,690
then I tried to do I don't know anything

00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,690
else

00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:28,970
right so like once you have that initial

00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,319
understanding you feel great and then

00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,680
you start to realize how much you don't

00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:36,860
know and wonderfully the Gulf gets

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,230
bigger the more experience you get so if

00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,269
you feel like an imposter right now it's

00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:45,709
only going to get worse from here I am

00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:47,810
sorry and another wonderful illustration

00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:49,639
from this index that displays the

00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:52,579
difference between dunning-kruger and

00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:54,079
the imposter syndrome with

00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:56,750
dunning-kruger you think that you're

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:59,000
really great and you're not and with the

00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:01,370
imposter syndrome you think that you're

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,959
really bad and you're great and it's

00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:05,089
really hard to know what the difference

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,899
between those two things are we're gonna

00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:11,569
work on so if you're thinking how does

00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:14,930
this affect me and I sense you're

00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:16,730
feeling you might know already we talked

00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:19,579
about being super human and trying to be

00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:21,889
super human and we often have high

00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:24,560
expectations and low levels of

00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:27,439
forgiveness for ourselves we work long

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,870
hours we miss out on sleep and sometimes

00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:35,689
fun and enjoyment because we're trying

00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:37,819
to do all the things we feel like

00:16:35,689 --> 00:16:40,579
failing when we can't do it all in fact

00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:43,990
I found a copy of Rihanna's to-do list I

00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:43,990
hope she doesn't mind if I share it

00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:48,000
it's not actually mine I didn't write

00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,940
this

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,680
Sara pro-growth is wonderful with 95

00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,830
things I should do every day according

00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:58,320
to the Internet including such important

00:16:55,830 --> 00:17:00,120
highways such as where smart

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,110
professional outfit carefully selected

00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:06,030
from capsule wardrobe shower make sure

00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:08,580
water temperature isn't too hot

00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:11,700
I think meditate is on here about three

00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:14,820
different times and if you are anything

00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:16,470
like me and really really loved looking

00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,640
at articles on the internet that tell

00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,339
you everything you're doing wrong about

00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,410
your life this might be a narrative that

00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:24,959
you have running in your head pretty

00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:28,160
frequently particularly when we're

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:31,530
looking at a culture of life hacks and

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:35,430
12 things that real leaders do before

00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:39,030
breakfast and so the end result of that

00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:41,850
is the people with impostor syndrome are

00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:44,910
less likely to raise their hands this is

00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:47,700
according to some research from birth

00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:50,130
away and a number of research partners

00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,950
that people who have impostor syndrome

00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,750
in the workplace less likely to

00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,670
volunteer for projects that fall outside

00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,770
their job description there are less and

00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:01,320
less likely to take on new things and

00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:03,750
they're less likely to participate in a

00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,520
way that is beneficial for the

00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:08,190
organization but not for them and as an

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:11,460
individual employee and Breanna and I

00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:13,800
were lucky enough to hear a related talk

00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,230
by the very brilliant Amy Cuddy and she

00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,630
gave a TED talk about presence she just

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,400
published a book by the same name and

00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:23,160
she talks about how our posture affects

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,820
our mentality and the more space we take

00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:29,010
up bigger that we are the better that we

00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:32,340
feel and the more confident and present

00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:34,710
we are the opposite can happen if we

00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:36,810
don't feel confident and we're trying to

00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:39,360
almost go within ourselves and shrink

00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:41,820
away making us even less likely to

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,650
participate to put ourselves in

00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,590
situations where we might not know

00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:49,470
everything and agree on us it more less

00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:52,270
likely to raise our hands and so what is

00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:55,520
that wind up feeling like

00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:57,590
self-doubt you're less likely to start

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,360
new things like I said you're less

00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:01,640
likely to take on new projects and

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:07,640
you're not very good at evaluating your

00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:09,050
own performance anxiety I think we've

00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,140
all felt something like this

00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:14,600
the feeling of is it all gonna come

00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:19,550
crashing down what if I can't pull it

00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:24,020
off tomorrow here a failure and fear of

00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:25,910
success and the feeling of isolation and

00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,620
this seems to be big in some of the

00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:29,330
people that we've talked to that didn't

00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,880
really know imposter syndrome was so

00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:33,710
common it's the feeling that no one else

00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,500
feels this way that you're all alone

00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:37,250
everyone else seems confident knows what

00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,650
they're talking about

00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:44,360
and that the people around you and your

00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:47,000
peers are smarter than you shame this is

00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:48,680
a big one for brenÃ© Brown if anyone else

00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,770
has a similar favorite researcher

00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:53,930
storyteller the only one I know of but

00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:56,780
feeling embarrassed not to know things

00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:58,520
feeling like your work wouldn't stand up

00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,850
if somebody who actually knew what they

00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:04,100
were talking about where to look at it

00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:06,140
and then last there's despair which

00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:08,510
seems like a really heavy word but it's

00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,400
that feeling of there's no way this is

00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:12,950
going to get better and I'll never catch

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:22,640
up to my peers and I'm stuck feeling

00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:28,370
this way always in short we have some

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:29,930
solutions all right so like I mentioned

00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:31,400
at the beginning of this talk when I

00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,750
first started reading about impostor

00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,340
syndrome there was some common advice

00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:37,340
about it that didn't sit right with me

00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:41,030
and the number one most common impostor

00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:41,660
syndrome advice I saw was this fake it

00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:45,380
till you make it

00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:48,260
I really dislike fake it till you make

00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:51,950
it and here's why fake it till you make

00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:54,080
it relies on dishonesty and it doesn't

00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:57,080
address the core issues related to

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,060
imposter syndrome the whole concept of

00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,860
fake it till you make it it's fine to

00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,600
get you in the door but then you get

00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,250
there and maybe you learn the thing that

00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,400
you're supposed to learn or you pick up

00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:08,100
the school you're supposed to

00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:11,010
up and then you're rewarded in some way

00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:13,440
with a promotion or you take on more

00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:16,410
responsibility and then you have to fake

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:20,300
that thing and what you wind up in is a

00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:23,720
perpetual fakeness fakeness cycle and

00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,720
when does it end

00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:31,620
so instead think about what you value

00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:34,740
and what the kind of place that you want

00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:36,590
to be in values man and I came up with

00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,810
five values of our own

00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:41,700
the first one is curiosity

00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:44,310
curiosity is fundamentally incompatible

00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,140
with fake it till you make it fake it

00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:48,240
till you make it assumes you have to act

00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:51,020
like you know everything and curiosity

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:54,720
encourages you to ask questions and

00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:57,180
motivation motivation is what gets us up

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,170
in the morning it's what drives us to

00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,570
make things better

00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:03,420
whether that means by helping people or

00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:06,120
solving problems and your motivation is

00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:09,860
fueled by passion I think we can all

00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,860
identify that as a value that we have

00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:15,270
growth if you're already acting like

00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:18,650
you're at where you want to be then how

00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:18,650
are you going to actually get there

00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:24,810
humility and this may seem like a

00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,910
contradiction since I know I've been

00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:29,520
talking about accepting praise and

00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:31,280
owning your accomplishments you can do

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,620
these things and still be humble

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:37,590
humility is valued because it means

00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:40,050
you're not being egotistical or vain or

00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:45,260
conceited or as I'd like to put it a

00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:49,830
bragging jerk face and number five

00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:53,760
empathy you can't hear somebody if

00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:58,170
you're too busy focused on what other

00:22:53,760 --> 00:23:00,270
people are thinking of you all right

00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:02,460
so when you look at this list of five

00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:04,970
values what you see is that it's not

00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:09,450
about what you know it's not about

00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:11,400
specific languages it's not about any

00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:14,220
kind of itemized checklist that you

00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,930
could possibly address this is about how

00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,840
you think and the kind of person that

00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:20,880
you are

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,710
and we talked before about the six ways

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,260
that you could be experiencing impostor

00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:26,789
syndrome and what we wanted to go into

00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:31,860
next are the ways that you can leverage

00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:34,049
these feelings for good and we present

00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:37,740
to you not just the big six but the

00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:39,450
manageable not that bad six so the first

00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:42,409
was the imposter cycle which you

00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:44,490
remember was that long journey of

00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:48,029
experiences that lead to one another

00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:51,149
that we kind of get stuck in and the way

00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:53,039
around that is to name it just stopping

00:23:51,149 --> 00:23:55,230
the cycle is all about recognizing that

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,809
you're in it if you can anticipate your

00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:00,600
next move or reaction you can intervene

00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:03,570
on your own behalf reversing negative

00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,039
feelings and self-talk can be tough but

00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:06,659
you can take this opportunity to feel

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,299
empathy for yourself and those around

00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:10,710
you who may be in the same boat and may

00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:16,590
be feeling the same things that you're

00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:18,419
feeling this is one that can be really

00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:20,429
helpful if you do the same task multiple

00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:22,980
times as well you get to learn what your

00:24:20,429 --> 00:24:25,740
own cycle is you know about three days

00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:27,990
ago getting ready for this talk I knew

00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:30,090
that while I felt fine at the time that

00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:34,470
within the next twelve to eighteen hours

00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:37,740
I was going to start freaking out and I

00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:43,230
did and then I watched CJ Cregg on the

00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:45,690
west wing and calm down my touchstone so

00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:50,220
number two the need to be special or the

00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:53,789
very best the instead would like to

00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:57,179
offer you there is no very best there is

00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:59,490
no single best Python programmer in the

00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:02,159
world I can assure you there is no

00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:04,440
single best anything in the world and in

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,639
any kind of situation where you see

00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,529
somebody who is supposed to be the best

00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:09,330
at anything it's not the only way to

00:25:07,529 --> 00:25:12,929
measure the best at that thing

00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:16,019
this may sound cliche but you are

00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:18,179
awesome and you don't have to be number

00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:21,360
one in anything because there is no

00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:23,340
number one in anything be proud to be

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,669
counted among your talented and

00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:28,950
intelligent and wonderful Pierce and you

00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:30,909
can lift each other up but you can't

00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:32,169
lift each other up if your constant

00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:37,989
trying to one-up each others

00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:42,330
accomplishments we talked about the

00:25:37,989 --> 00:25:44,679
quest to be superhuman and trying to do

00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:48,220
everything under the Sun everything that

00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:51,129
we think we should be doing well our

00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:53,200
remedy for this is to stop just to stop

00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:56,769
you have to stop holding yourself to

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,859
unrealistic expectations prioritize the

00:25:56,769 --> 00:26:02,499
important things assess actual knowledge

00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:04,929
gaps that you may have and start

00:26:02,499 --> 00:26:06,700
learning things that can help you but

00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:08,229
pick one thing at a time choose one

00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,389
thing that you could start learning

00:26:08,229 --> 00:26:12,970
today or tomorrow that could help you

00:26:10,389 --> 00:26:14,859
get better at your job but try not to

00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:16,470
set those goals for yourself where

00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:18,759
you're trying to do 10 things at once

00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:21,249
you're not boiling the ocean you don't

00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:23,289
have to do everything and setting small

00:26:21,249 --> 00:26:25,299
goals for yourself is important and also

00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:28,869
being able to forgive yourself when you

00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:31,090
don't achieve all of your goals so you

00:26:28,869 --> 00:26:36,099
don't have to do 95 things a day even if

00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:43,299
the internet says you should alright

00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:46,690
fear failure redefine failure this is a

00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:48,340
huge one obviously all successful people

00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:51,519
have failed we talk about this all the

00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:53,169
time but taking your failures as a

00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:55,539
failure of the thing that you did and

00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:58,149
not a failure your failure of you as a

00:26:55,539 --> 00:27:00,159
person is extremely important for

00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:02,460
addressing impostor syndrome and this is

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:08,070
something that almost everyone I know

00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:08,070
has to remind themselves of constantly

00:27:09,749 --> 00:27:15,460
the next is the denial of competence and

00:27:12,669 --> 00:27:18,190
discounting praise and we don't want to

00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:21,580
get caught up in this sometimes it's

00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:23,139
okay to just say thank you it's easy to

00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,849
tell yourself you're being humble or you

00:27:23,139 --> 00:27:27,519
just got lucky but if you worked hard

00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:29,409
accept the compliments if you're

00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:31,749
criticized you can take it in stride but

00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:33,700
if you're getting a compliment remember

00:27:31,749 --> 00:27:35,200
you have to give the compliment give her

00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,539
the respect that they deserve and

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:41,049
remember that their point of view about

00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:43,450
your skills has value internalize the

00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:44,620
accomplishment and recognize that your

00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:48,450
skills your dry

00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:48,450
and your talent are what got you here

00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:53,760
and finally fear and guilt about success

00:27:54,029 --> 00:27:59,529
for one thing get out of your own way

00:27:56,429 --> 00:28:05,860
just acknowledge that success can be

00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:08,679
scary that while that is scary thing you

00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:10,890
can motivate inspire and kick-start your

00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:14,679
friends and colleagues towards success

00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:18,669
by displaying your own don't feel guilt

00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:20,559
for beating out others for awards or

00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:21,909
promotions it doesn't mean to be

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,520
ruthless

00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:27,159
it means accept that with the

00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:29,049
responsibility that it comes with when

00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:30,940
you are recognized for doing something

00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:33,220
when you get a promotion recognize that

00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:36,789
as an opportunity to lead and to help

00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:39,610
other people achieve success know that

00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:41,200
this the success and that one instance

00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:44,049
can be a great reminder for the future

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:51,789
and then help bring other people to

00:28:44,049 --> 00:28:54,039
success with you there's so much at

00:28:51,789 --> 00:28:56,230
stake for us as a culture of

00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:59,559
increasingly educated talented and

00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:02,470
skilled people most of whom don't know

00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:04,240
how great they are for those who come

00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:07,210
after us we need to embrace our inner

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,590
imposters and talk nicely to them about

00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:11,250
how we're growing and becoming better

00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:13,330
and about how far we've already come

00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,399
remember that you deserve to be where

00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:18,610
you are to go where you're going next

00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:21,640
and help others gain confidence by

00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:23,620
sharing your knowledge we're living in a

00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,690
world where smart and empathetic people

00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:27,730
are self-selecting out of opportunities

00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:30,850
it's important on an individual level

00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:33,700
but we also know that representation

00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:35,289
matters we are motivated to succeed when

00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,809
people who look like us and face

00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:40,510
challenges similar to our own succeed

00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:46,299
before we do leadership doesn't have to

00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:48,490
come from the top so at this point we'd

00:29:46,299 --> 00:29:50,409
like everybody to take a look at

00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:54,370
whatever you wrote down a few minutes

00:29:50,409 --> 00:29:55,620
ago we hear a lot the phrase what would

00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:58,030
you do if you knew you could not fail

00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:00,670
it's an unrealistic viewpoint

00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:03,070
and we're not asking anyone that but we

00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:05,680
are asking you to consider what is

00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:08,080
important enough to you that it's worth

00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:10,030
going through all of this stuff that we

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,550
just talked about

00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:14,950
we'd like to end the regular part of the

00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:16,750
presentation with this wonderful quote

00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:19,510
by Kelly sue Taconic who's a comic book

00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:22,600
writer heroes don't limit themselves to

00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:26,560
the fights they know they can win so

00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:28,270
thank you all for joining us and now

00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,190
we'd like to take a few minutes if

00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:31,600
anybody would like to share any of the

00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:33,550
things that impostor syndrome might have

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,590
been holding them back from or an

00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:37,600
example of experiencing impostor

00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:41,290
syndrome in your own workplaces or

00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:43,350
personal lives thank you so much thank

00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:43,350
you

00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:55,410
first of all I want to thank you a lot

00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:57,960
to say this out loud it's a is it's it

00:30:55,410 --> 00:31:02,130
was really great but I have a question

00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:05,310
for you because what about the fear that

00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:07,050
you're so ignorant about something that

00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:09,120
you can't actually realize how bad you

00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:11,430
are at it because I think what you guys

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:15,510
are talking about here it actually

00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:17,610
assumes that you can realize that maybe

00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:20,940
you're bad at something but what about

00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:23,400
if you don't have that knowledge that's

00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:26,700
a really excellent question one thing

00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:28,140
that we originally had actually as a

00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,510
part of our slides and we couldn't quite

00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:32,910
get it to work in was about the

00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:34,860
importance of both asking better

00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:37,490
questions and providing better answers

00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:40,160
and this is not a thing that's

00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:42,750
specifically for one individual to do

00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:45,630
but one thing that I have seen is people

00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:47,280
have questions about something they are

00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:49,500
a really elementary understanding they

00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:52,410
ask the question they person they ask

00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:54,300
the question of says oh you don't know

00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:56,190
that already or oh you they haven't

00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:58,650
covered that with you or oh how did you

00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:01,530
not figure that out yet

00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:03,420
and so on the flip side of that for

00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:06,090
anybody who's concerned about feeling

00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:07,800
like they don't know enough to be sure

00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:10,800
that you're providing answers in a way

00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:17,330
that you would want to hear them but in

00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:19,980
terms of knowing how much you know I

00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:23,340
would recommend really getting amerce

00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:29,780
nakum unity of peers and helping each

00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:29,780
other that was great thank you Thanks

00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,040
anyone else if you don't have any

00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:36,630
questions we'd love to hear if you

00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,870
wanted to share your experience or

00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:42,000
anything that resonated with you about

00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:43,380
impostor syndrome or anything with the

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,300
topic that you're experiencing at work

00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:51,510
or at home sure uh so last year I did a

00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:55,790
talk at a PI Gotham for the first time

00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:58,200
and after they accepted my proposal

00:32:55,790 --> 00:33:00,050
that's when it all like came crashing

00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,500
for because I was like

00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:05,600
Who am I to go and talk to a bunch of

00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,310
people that probably are whole hell of a

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,340
lot smarter than I have and know a lot

00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:11,720
more about this stuff oh it's really

00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,800
cool especially in like the Django

00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,010
community I'm sure you guys can

00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:19,300
appreciate this is like the the

00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:22,790
community was super supportive and like

00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:25,460
everybody is like really positive and so

00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:28,220
to your point you know there's

00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:31,070
definitely some risk to it but

00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:33,350
especially if anybody more specifically

00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:35,530
if anybody's thinking about or

00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:38,030
hesitating about doing a talk it's like

00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:38,660
especially in this community like go for

00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:42,230
it you'll be fine

00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:44,150
promise that's great thank you for that

00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:45,320
and something we would heard of that I'd

00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:47,330
like to share is we were talking about

00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,920
this before we came in here today one of

00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:51,080
the things that Amy Cuddy spoke about in

00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,610
her talk about presence was when she

00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,620
gives a talk one of the primary things

00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:56,960
that she does to feel comfortable is to

00:33:54,620 --> 00:34:00,080
trust her audience so going into a

00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:03,320
presentation or to talk with the

00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:05,120
knowledge that on the whole people are

00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,530
good people and they want to listen to

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,419
what you have to say and they're they

00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:10,190
are curious and they are empathetic and

00:34:08,419 --> 00:34:11,960
I think the Django community is a really

00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:15,830
good example of a place where you can

00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:17,510
trust your audience I always have an

00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:19,220
issue where I feel if I'm not the best

00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:21,140
at something I'm automatically the worst

00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:23,270
at something which always gets in my way

00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:25,310
and to prove that a little bit I was

00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:28,850
using the wrong hashtag through the

00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:30,950
entire talk and then I got there oh my

00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:35,690
god this is horrible so will you please

00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:37,580
forgive me also there are two ways to

00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:38,899
spell impostor and I didn't clarify

00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:41,530
which one we're using at the beginning

00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:44,990
so that might be my fault

00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:50,659
gonna go it's kind of nerve-wracking

00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:54,380
this mic um I I guess I got a comment

00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:58,010
because you know starting out not having

00:34:54,380 --> 00:35:00,650
ever been hired in the tech field but

00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:02,480
really liking it you know you go online

00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:04,400
try to get help and we've already had

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,130
talks on this and everything but you

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,780
know you might write in to Stack

00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:11,330
Exchange a question and then somebody

00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:13,640
writes back and it's like go steady or

00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:13,880
like before you like why not study this

00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,830
we

00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,000
we ask a question so it's really hard

00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:22,220
because like you really don't know much

00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:24,380
but I feel like now I've realized that

00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:26,600
if I I'm just focusing on what I want to

00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:29,030
do I'm doing projects that I like and

00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,710
I'm so curious about them that it just

00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:33,050
doesn't matter as much anymore and all

00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:34,130
that's kind of going away and I feel

00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:36,200
like I'm just following my heart like

00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:38,030
that's why I'm here it's kind of it's

00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,100
kind of cool but you guys are awesome by

00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:49,040
the way I mean like this is a cool place

00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:52,190
to be so thank you um I would like to

00:35:49,040 --> 00:36:01,460
share kind of two different varieties of

00:35:52,190 --> 00:36:07,240
this that I see myself one is I don't

00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:09,950
think I knew has to bite with laziness

00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:13,190
I'd like it when things work and they

00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:16,850
work well and I want to get to that

00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:18,230
point immediately and I know this about

00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:19,370
myself something I struggled with my

00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:21,350
entire life since I was a teenager

00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:26,620
probably before but you know nobody pays

00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:29,870
attention when you're eight but in

00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:32,000
trying to deal with that and trying to

00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:39,790
make sure that I don't slip into that

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:42,140
kind of well laziness I almost get into

00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:44,750
kind of like I feel like an inverse

00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:46,430
fractal you know not the kind that goes

00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,840
out and gets more detailed because you

00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:49,580
can see it's bigger but the kind that

00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,810
keeps going inwards

00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:56,030
you know infinitely you know and and

00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:59,030
that's really hard because it's a matter

00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:00,980
of unlike the examples that you gave in

00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:04,040
your talk where you know people will put

00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:05,300
in 12-hour days because you know oh I

00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,780
have to get this done to prove something

00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:09,710
because they will get it done

00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:11,570
sometimes I find myself not getting it

00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:13,400
done you know I'm putting in those

00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:17,390
12-hour days and it's not getting done

00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,260
because it's not perfect or you know the

00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:21,410
other thing in the open-source community

00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:25,220
is you know like the last fella just

00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:27,020
mentioned is that we tend to be rather

00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:29,329
ruthless

00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:30,970
not necessarily the Drago community but

00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:35,869
you know in the open-source community

00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:37,880
with new people you know we get on their

00:37:35,869 --> 00:37:40,670
cases about you know well you've read

00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:42,020
all those man pages didn't you go but

00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:43,910
you read the docs and read that you know

00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:45,410
400 pages of documentation and

00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:50,630
understand everything perfectly the

00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:52,970
first time because you know there are

00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:58,550
probably a few of us that can do that

00:37:52,970 --> 00:38:02,119
and most of us can't but it's also - is

00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:05,390
is kind of recognizing one's pardon the

00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:09,650
term in her because we feel that

00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:12,890
with ourselves we're like I haven't done

00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:16,309
enough groundwork to ask that question

00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:17,980
yet or I'm good I went I want to fix

00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:22,069
this thing in this particular project

00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:24,920
but this is absolutely not up to the

00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:27,290
standards of the project you know the

00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,880
people in the project and you know you

00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:32,180
don't even give them the opportunity to

00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:35,390
tell you this is garbage you know you

00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:36,799
just kind of you know flog yourself into

00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:38,770
that and ultimately you know in six

00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:41,510
months you'll have the perfect patch set

00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:46,839
but in the meantime you know it's still

00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:46,839
broken so anyway I just want to

00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:55,670
I'd imagine that's not unrelated to the

00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:59,350
number of web developers I know who

00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:59,350
don't have their own personal websites

00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:06,650
thank you so much for this talk I really

00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:10,060
appreciate that you came at it from the

00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:13,070
perspective of like knowing that we all

00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:17,900
occasionally or maybe frequently have

00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:19,670
this imposter syndrome and we and how to

00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:23,080
sort of address that within ourselves

00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:25,760
but I also feel like I often find myself

00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:29,180
in a different position which is that I

00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:31,040
often find that I am in a group you know

00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:33,350
whether that's in a workspace or with my

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,450
friends where I actually feel like I

00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:37,250
have a fair amount of confidence and I

00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:39,650
feel like sometimes people around me

00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:44,090
have less confidence than you know that

00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:45,320
they deserve and I would I would love to

00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:48,770
hear if you have thoughts on how you

00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:51,530
create environments like conferences or

00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:53,540
workspaces or even like how you deal

00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:55,220
with it in your social groups you know

00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:57,590
how you create places that support

00:39:55,220 --> 00:40:06,170
people who are experiencing some

00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:07,820
imposter syndrome yeah I think we

00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:10,790
touched on that a little bit when we

00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:13,880
were talking about succeeding and how

00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:16,430
when you succeed you're not only

00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,860
benefitting yourself and the work that

00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:21,800
you've done but you're able to inspire

00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:23,480
others and it goes back to what Brianna

00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,800
was saying before about giving good

00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,310
answers when people ask you questions

00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,290
and not being the guy or the girl who

00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:32,810
says oh you should have read that in the

00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:34,400
documentation or oh you should know that

00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:36,080
already or why haven't you learned that

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,200
but being the person that answers

00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:40,640
questions in a really helpful way and in

00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,970
a way that can build people's confidence

00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:45,050
and pointing people in the direction of

00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:47,330
resources that they might not know about

00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:51,500
that can help them build their knowledge

00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:54,980
and continue to grow as developers and

00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:57,980
as people and being able to kind of be

00:40:54,980 --> 00:41:00,560
supportive to your close network so that

00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:01,760
when you're introduced to someone or you

00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,370
speak with someone outside of the

00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,690
network at a conference like this that

00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:07,670
you feel like you have

00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:10,040
this and being supportive and in being

00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:14,720
empathetic and in answering people in a

00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:16,460
clear way it helps them but also default

00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,170
to checking in with people to make sure

00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:19,550
that they have the necessary baseline

00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:22,700
knowledge for whatever conversation

00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:24,230
you're about to have I know that one

00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,570
thing that has made me feel like an

00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:27,290
impostor several times several is an

00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:29,630
understatement

00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:31,220
many many times in the past is being

00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:33,500
part of a conversation and then

00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:35,450
realizing about two minutes into it that

00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,830
I don't know what's happening and twenty

00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:40,330
minutes into it that I haven't known

00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:42,530
what's happening the entire time and

00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:44,030
then there's also the assumption that I

00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:49,340
know it's other people think I know

00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:54,440
what's going on and then it's thanks for

00:41:49,340 --> 00:42:00,260
the question thank you I am I want to do

00:41:54,440 --> 00:42:03,050
my sharing person so I am a minute I

00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:05,090
work in IC for a university and I

00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:08,300
haven't completed a formal education and

00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:10,970
that is terrifying it's terrifying to

00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:12,350
say to a large group of people this is

00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:14,600
the second time I've heard your talk and

00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:15,770
it is the second time I've had this

00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,410
chance to share this with a large group

00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:19,820
of people and it feels it felt better

00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:21,170
the first time I'm hoping it makes me

00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:23,060
feel a little bit better this time so I

00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:26,630
just want to say thank you for you know

00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:28,340
giving this talk I some I think you

00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:30,230
might have been the one and this talk to

00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:32,630
say I don't know exactly where I heard

00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:34,910
this but I'm reminded that the the

00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:36,680
people who hired me are confident they

00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:37,880
are knew this about me before they hired

00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,320
me throughout my career and are

00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:42,350
confident and my ability to do my job

00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:45,410
and I have to remember that when I'm you

00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:49,960
know doing my job because otherwise I

00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:49,960
I'm terrified so thank you

00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:00,770
thank you guys for your speech it really

00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:04,250
resonated with me kind of like I'm sorry

00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:06,710
to know your your name but like like

00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:08,270
he's saying I'm self-taught too and kind

00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:10,010
of when you first started out you kind

00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:12,230
of don't think you're a programmer and

00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:15,200
you get to be too expert at like all

00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:17,840
these things and I guess just more

00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,070
comment like if you're reading stuff and

00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,090
just doing it even though it's just like

00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:22,820
following the examples are still

00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:24,080
programmer don't don't not call yourself

00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:25,430
one cuz you don't think you have a skill

00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,320
level you're you're getting there so

00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:29,690
thank you yeah that's definitely

00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:32,720
important thank you so much there was a

00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:34,280
survey going around recently and this is

00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,230
terrible it should not be saying this

00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,640
into a microphone cuz I have no citation

00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:39,470
information for this whatsoever but

00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:41,090
there was a large survey of developers I

00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:44,960
can't remember where it came from

00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:47,300
it's 48 percent I believe of developers

00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:50,270
in the survey where did not have any

00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:52,550
kind of computer science degree which is

00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:56,300
not surprising anecdotally but I've

00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:59,210
spoken to so many programmers that feel

00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:03,310
like it's just them if they don't have a

00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:03,310
degree or they don't have one in kansai

00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:12,590
high so I guess I just kinda wanted to

00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,990
come down and speak even though like I'm

00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:16,700
freaking out right now cuz I just cuz I

00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:18,380
didn't notice a whole lot of well at

00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:21,410
least this gendered female coming down

00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:23,240
so I kinda wanted to represent I just

00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:23,750
wanted to share that um I'm actually a

00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,280
sysadmin

00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:27,050
I'm not a developer so that's like

00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,360
number one and like I don't even know

00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:30,940
what I'm doing here oh but like it's

00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,080
also a very traditionally male-dominated

00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:35,120
just like programming as I assume but

00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:41,630
the whole Nick Nick beard vibe is very

00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:43,760
you know strong and so so that even so

00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:45,710
even just admitting that I've that I

00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,480
feel like an imposter a lot of times

00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:48,560
makes me feel like that's something like

00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,600
this is gonna have like really bad

00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,790
repercussions for me in the workplace I

00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,750
actually work at Wharton here so there's

00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:55,130
probably a lot of people in this room

00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:58,030
that I'm like afraid to find my

00:44:55,130 --> 00:45:00,860
supervisors not here thank goodness so

00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:03,740
no one telling him that I have no idea

00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:04,610
what I'm doing my job every day but like

00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,690
that's what I feel like and there's

00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:07,589
probably people in this room who think

00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:08,999
I'm an idiot too

00:45:07,589 --> 00:45:10,650
about you either but like that's that's

00:45:08,999 --> 00:45:13,529
sort of the general thought process that

00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:15,299
like I guess goes through my head every

00:45:13,529 --> 00:45:16,499
day and I have to try and I've read

00:45:15,299 --> 00:45:17,369
about impostor syndrome on the internet

00:45:16,499 --> 00:45:19,440
and I kind of try to remember with

00:45:17,369 --> 00:45:20,849
myself and go through these steps but

00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,400
it's like it's the process every day

00:45:20,849 --> 00:45:24,630
I've gotta wake up and remember even if

00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,009
you think you're an idiot you're the

00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:40,589
only idiot still doing this job so

00:45:26,009 --> 00:45:41,910
you've got I like you know I thought one

00:45:40,589 --> 00:45:43,920
of the most interesting things you said

00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:45,569
was that people with impostor syndrome

00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,900
and you know who you are don't raise

00:45:45,569 --> 00:45:51,599
their hand it's much easier to be smart

00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:53,249
if you set the agenda so if you have

00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,930
someone who's giving you a coding exam

00:45:53,249 --> 00:45:55,950
and they want to rebalance a red-black

00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:57,710
tree or something like that and you

00:45:55,950 --> 00:46:00,420
Bailey remember that from way back when

00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:02,009
you're gonna look like the fool it's the

00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:04,859
person who's asking the questions who

00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:06,390
has a lot of power so if you put

00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:07,650
yourself into position where you keep

00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:10,259
your hands down you're never the person

00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:13,259
asking the question so I think the

00:46:10,259 --> 00:46:16,130
counterintuitive part of the solution is

00:46:13,259 --> 00:46:19,079
to be the person who stands up and talks

00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:21,450
know the more you hide the worse it is

00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:23,400
better to stand up and give it a shot

00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:25,259
and even if you get shot down first time

00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,489
learn from that and get up again and

00:46:25,259 --> 00:46:30,799
again and again until the hill trips

00:46:26,489 --> 00:46:30,799
down that's great

00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:41,710
hi so in about 45 minutes I'm going to

00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:44,440
be standing there and I'm going to be

00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:47,170
giving a talk and I'm feeling pretty

00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,850
imposter about it right now what did you

00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:56,320
guys do to psych yourselves up for this

00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:59,050
one thinking back to an hour from now I

00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:01,990
think a lot of what we have tried to

00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:03,400
keep in mind and what we we've told

00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:04,870
people actually as we've had these

00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,540
conversations for the past seven or

00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:10,480
eight months is that you're a set of

00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:12,670
knowledge your set of skills is

00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:15,070
different from anyone else in this room

00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:17,490
and there's I want to say it's like a

00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:20,740
Venn diagram or close to a Venn diagram

00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:22,480
that people think of or that that has

00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:24,370
been seen when thinking of imposter

00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,710
syndrome and it was what everyone else

00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:28,870
knows and what I know being a very small

00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:30,550
part of that but in reality what someone

00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:32,440
else knows and what you know may have

00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:33,820
overlap but you still have a lot to

00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:37,450
provide and a lot to offer

00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:40,390
so trying not to go into a presentation

00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:41,890
or a talk thinking that your audience

00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:45,160
knows everything you're already about to

00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:47,230
say and they're not going to be learning

00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:49,780
anything and they're going to be judging

00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:51,400
you and they're going to be you know

00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:53,680
sitting there doing something else in

00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,880
reality like people are here and people

00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,080
are gonna be at your talk because they

00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,180
want to hear what you have to say and

00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:59,380
you know things that they don't know yet

00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:01,390
and you're gonna be able to impart

00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:03,460
information on them that is new and

00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:05,350
that's exciting and that will

00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:09,420
potentially inspire them to do something

00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:12,460
great also the layout of this room is

00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:14,940
terrifying as a speaker but the people

00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,940
are really nice

00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:22,340
all right thank you everyone for joining

00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:22,340
