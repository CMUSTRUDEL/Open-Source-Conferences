Description: 
	Just Enough Typography by Joni Trythall

Design is 95% typography, or something like that. Having a grasp on what makes for pleasant, easy to read typography that reinforces your brand is the first step towards building an amazing, impactful experience. Together we will explore typography fundamentals:

Sizing, spacing, and rhythm to make all of our type feel cohesive.
How to improve readability and encourage the user to read.
Type families and different styles.
Choosing and pairing fonts, how many to use, and when to use them.
Much more!
These typography basics will help you better understand why some typefaces just donâ€™t work and give you some go-to solutions for when the designer is out sick (or has gone crazy). Weâ€™ll learn a bunch but not too much, it will be just enough :grin:

come on

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:21,820
pulling yourself home so hello doing

00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:24,340
nice to meet all of you incredibly

00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:29,290
nervous yawn supposed to say that I just

00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:32,500
don't care Oh luckily I see a lot of

00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:34,090
familiar faces it's just great when I

00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,160
was rehearsing this in my head I was

00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,079
like talking like for imaginary people

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:44,500
which I see now that was like not

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:47,350
realistic at all um so let's I just get

00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,210
started we're going to learn a bunch

00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:53,410
today and it's really quick time

00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:56,260
together this talk is about knowing just

00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:58,660
enough typography to produce a really

00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,879
delightful reading experience on the web

00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,829
so we're not going to talk about the

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:06,010
anatomy of type you know I have an

00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:08,050
awesome poster about that or like all

00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:11,020
the terminology associated with

00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:13,990
topography in general this is for people

00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:16,840
who want to finish their side projects

00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:19,360
on their own or fill in the gap when a

00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,640
designer is out sick well I think my

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,140
abstract says something about them going

00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,409
crazy or something I don't know it's

00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:27,880
probably more likely but ok so I just

00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:29,290
like to be super honest this is how I'm

00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,689
going to spend your time today this is a

00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:38,159
high-level look at what works going to

00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:41,950
be talking about what is it though I'm

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:45,329
topography is what language looks like

00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:48,729
so it's the art and technique of

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:53,829
displaying text in a way that is

00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:57,159
delightful and easy to read it's not

00:01:53,829 --> 00:02:01,090
strictly visual or aesthetic it's

00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:05,229
utilitarian and it's for for anyone who

00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:09,610
uses text to communicate so thanks for

00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:12,640
choosing the stuff it matters a lot um

00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:16,040
the National Weather Service reach the

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:19,470
top yelling at us rain chances

00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:23,489
here we're using all caps to communicate

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:25,650
like forecasts and just general messages

00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:27,180
so it was kind of funny because it's

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,620
really hard to read you have this like

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,450
emergency and it's like it takes forever

00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,640
to like really understand what's

00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,130
happening because all caps creates like

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,880
a very blocky experience and it's hard

00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:41,010
to distinguish the letters um and also

00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,160
sometimes it's like it might rain today

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,569
a little and like three it's like that's

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,230
all it's saying and your heart rates

00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:54,420
going ah but the world is ending it just

00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:56,910
might rain so so that was a really great

00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,190
thing that happened this year how NASA

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,690
learned a lot of things there was some

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,060
accidents that happened and they did

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:06,209
some investigating and they found that

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:09,299
there the design of their documentation

00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:11,850
in their maps was to blame play did some

00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:15,769
research and they published a 40 ish

00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:18,750
page document so lightful reading

00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:21,329
lessons learned there and it includes

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,850
things they were using a font size that

00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:26,400
was over fifty percent smaller than been

00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:30,600
recommended so people couldn't read it

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,269
and it didn't it didn't like encourage

00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,400
reading when they did try to read it it

00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:39,090
saves lives this is really important

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,250
talk to yet um mode sides are less

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,650
terrible now for the longest time they

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:46,980
were they use a typeface called highway

00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:50,100
gothic and it was very hard to read in

00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,380
the rain and when it was dark and when

00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,390
you're lightheaded it would just sort of

00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:57,660
glare and blur together so really when

00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:59,850
you needed it the most it failed you so

00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,519
they got some designers to create a new

00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:06,569
type base and it's called clear view and

00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:08,010
it proved to be much better reaction

00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:09,569
times are better people could read it

00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:14,010
and there were there were less accidents

00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:15,870
in less diffusion also studies showed

00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:19,169
that you know when they focused on

00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:23,580
making the controls in the car easier to

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:24,810
read less drivers were distracted but

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:29,460
now there's like phones or

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:30,780
oh oh this is how i was going on about

00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,720
earlier this is what it looked like

00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,210
before it's like it's so anxiety

00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,120
provoking right and now this is this is

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:42,510
the new thing to say my brain frigging

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,980
umbrella um and these are the the street

00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:48,150
signs I was talking about before and

00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:51,990
after of the different typefaces okay

00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:53,820
folks emotion so the very an awesome

00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,070
example of this is the book with no

00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,260
pictures and it's nice figure this out

00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:02,070
already but it has no illustrations at

00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:03,900
all I hope and but it's really it's a

00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:06,270
really energizing book and I brought a

00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:09,330
copy for all of you to look at because

00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:11,669
it's been just such a huge fan but it's

00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,080
it has a really silly feel to it and

00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:19,169
it's a completely accomplished from

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:23,280
typography so influencing how users feel

00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:25,620
is very powerful I'm working on the web

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,720
we really it's a very impersonal medium

00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:32,070
and we really want to bring our brand

00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:35,760
across correctly and set the the voice

00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:38,220
and tone so it's it's a great way to

00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,710
express personality and stand out it's a

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,600
huge competitor advantage to be able to

00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:46,110
make someone feel the right way

00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:50,430
topography is such a great way to sort

00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:52,440
of pull that off um the safest

00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,810
assumptions we can make is that nobody

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,470
has time to use our products or website

00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:01,320
so when you use topography it's it's a

00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:03,060
really great way to evoke emotion and

00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,430
grab people's attention and make sure

00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,660
that they're getting the important

00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:11,430
information they need as quickly as

00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:13,020
possible it also strengthens memories so

00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,930
when someone's using your site and you

00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,190
make them feel a positive way they're

00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,560
going to remember it and they're going

00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:22,380
to remember the content better so this

00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,990
is especially important when you're sort

00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:29,280
of straying from established mental

00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:30,900
models in in any way if you if you evoke

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,740
emotion they're gonna they're going to

00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,740
remember that better

00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,050
oh and this is the author's actually BJ

00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:44,070
Novak and this is him reading his

00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:47,009
amazing book and this is just real quick

00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:49,320
through these in their random i/o times

00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:53,280
I just love this because it's like I

00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:58,530
would not stop at this it's like a light

00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:00,210
suggestion like you don't have you so I

00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:04,020
just think that's a really powerful way

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:09,050
of showing like how we communicate

00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:11,580
through the typefaces that we choose um

00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:13,259
readability and legibility so now that

00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,780
I've convinced you all that topography

00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:17,550
is like the most essential thing we're

00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,460
going to talk a bit about what good

00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,870
typography even means and how to get

00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,099
there and so these concepts are super

00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,500
straightforward and some of them are a

00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:28,139
little a little more invisible behind

00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,900
the scenes stuff so the most important

00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:32,669
thing if I could only choose one thing

00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:36,180
to talk about for 20 minutes would be

00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:41,520
the the size and the line height of of

00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:42,900
your text it's really frustrating to

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,030
come across like a site that's like

00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,770
credibly beautiful and is the tiniest

00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,229
tiniest text like you have no idea what

00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:52,169
a saying you have to magnify it that's

00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:55,409
really frustrating so understanding what

00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:58,860
size is appropriate for the web very

00:07:55,409 --> 00:08:00,510
important um luckily some people much

00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:04,289
smarter than myself established them

00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:08,220
like optimal font sizes it's between 14

00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:10,199
and 15 and 24 and 25 pixels it's really

00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,270
hard to get designers to agree on

00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,849
anything so I couldn't read like a

00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:17,580
straight answer but that is the the

00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:19,289
general range and then of course the

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,669
line height is between one hundred and

00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:24,139
twenty percent and one hundred and forty

00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:28,560
five percent and ideally you're using

00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:30,690
values like line high 1.5 which is one

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,209
it's one and a half times the font size

00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:35,310
that you selected so percentages are

00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:38,820
completely fine but not best practice

00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:40,560
exactly um so when you increase the font

00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,719
size you have to increase the line

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,940
height as well to ensure optimal

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,040
legibility and of course I'm mobile you

00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,990
can make it a little smaller because we

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,149
then much closer to our papers and then

00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:54,240
desktop though sometimes and I forget my

00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:56,579
glasses but it's not really the case so

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,350
you one thing to keep in mind is all

00:08:56,579 --> 00:09:01,320
these various font sizes have to be

00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:04,560
within a container that also change the

00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,500
size so this little thing i jabbed it i

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,300
put ish in there that's my little

00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,149
addition because i don't really follow

00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,279
this exactly so you just feel it out if

00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:16,949
your text takes up the entire screen

00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:22,440
it's just too is too long it's too hard

00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:23,940
to follow in skin I let this

00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,089
intentionally blank because I talked

00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:31,319
about myspace knife I was clever place

00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:34,829
see now that that was a mistake um white

00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:37,440
space is the empty space around elements

00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:42,930
so margins and padding in line height

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:44,970
also called negative spaces so I read

00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:47,069
this quote ones and I'm really bad at

00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:50,670
remembering who says stuff which is

00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:52,110
really rude but the power of white space

00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,990
comes from the limitations of human

00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:57,269
attention in memory so when you use

00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:59,100
white space well it helps guide the user

00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:02,100
through the page and they know what to

00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:05,850
absorb immediately in what it's like

00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,230
less important and also I when you win

00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:10,350
sometimes you see a site that you love

00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:12,389
and you can't exactly say why it's

00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:18,000
usually because it's like on point white

00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:20,370
space utilization void space and

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,620
proximity so the law of proximity states

00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:25,980
that items near each other are going to

00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:28,949
appear related so white space is a great

00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:36,510
way to confirm or deny relationships

00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:41,089
between text and images vertical rhythm

00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:44,579
I talked about this a bit already but

00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:46,819
basically this is done through setting a

00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:49,470
baseline so you set a line height and

00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:51,899
and then you're going to use multiples

00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:54,329
of that value throughout the site for

00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:56,010
visual consistency designers like to

00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:57,899
talk about consistency a lot right and

00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:00,329
so this is one way you can make them

00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:09,569
really happy to show them

00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:13,769
your vertical rhythm hierarchy on the

00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:16,549
web refers to the visual organization of

00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:21,959
things by importance through size

00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:25,199
proximity and color however hierarchy

00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:27,059
helps us understand what's important and

00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:29,429
helps you scan because we don't really

00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:33,029
read do it we just an we don't time for

00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:35,459
that we're very busy and repetition and

00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:38,730
consistency allows for safe assumption

00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:41,850
so if all the paragraphs on a site are

00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:44,279
gray and I'm scanning I'm not reading

00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,899
and all of a sudden I see a block of

00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:47,970
orange text well that's different that's

00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:49,709
that's not a paragraph so that's going

00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:52,529
to catch my attention that's going to

00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:54,449
make me pay attention but it was safe to

00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:58,619
assume that that wasn't a regular

00:11:54,449 --> 00:12:01,170
paragraph it's also very calming it just

00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:03,329
sort of goes back to I was saying when a

00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:05,790
site just feels right someone's

00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:11,819
obviously paid attention to to the

00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:14,339
spacing and hierarchy of that site I by

00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:16,199
contrast to be especially interesting

00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:18,110
right now I've noticed a lot of sites

00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:21,929
that are using poor contrast

00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:24,509
intentionally um I don't know why it

00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:27,449
hurts you'll know when you see it it

00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:30,149
looks like the letters are shaking if

00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:33,600
you have migraines you you you know I

00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:36,179
missed your computer a few times but

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,989
sometimes it's not so obvious so it's

00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:41,579
always safe to use a contrast checker

00:12:38,989 --> 00:12:46,040
contrast checker com I believe is the

00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:49,139
thing it's not you're going to grab that

00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,489
and I was actually working on an example

00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:51,720
of for contrast and I gave herself a

00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:56,339
headache and it was like why would I do

00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:58,549
that to them that is so awful so I just

00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:04,230
didn't but then I had this space there

00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:09,360
and I just spelled it right uh-huh okay

00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:13,889
hence this is used bold or italic who is

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:16,439
both Joey's underlines or !

00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:18,149
um they lose their effect right when

00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:21,980
it's like every sentence is an

00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:25,529
exclamation point it's counterproductive

00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:27,959
so when you're using a SAN serif you

00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:31,160
just bold because you've use italic it's

00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:34,169
not going to come across that clearly

00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:37,230
when you're using a serif you can use

00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:39,809
italic for light emphasis and bold for

00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:41,970
heavier emphasis and also just be

00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:44,459
careful not to overuse that's that's

00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:50,339
really the same here um you over use it

00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:52,350
it loses its effect oh and one less

00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:54,869
point and take us off I think is this

00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:59,279
Twitter or something and it's vibrating

00:13:54,869 --> 00:14:02,459
and low pressure on you um when you have

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:05,339
something in bold and there's a

00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:07,799
punctuation at the end don't don't let

00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:12,359
that punctuation inherit the formatting

00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:20,160
of the emphasized text hyphens and

00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:22,319
dashes okay so hyphens are the the

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,629
shortest little line of the three and

00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:29,100
there's just like a keyboard button for

00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:32,970
it super easy hyphens are often not used

00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:35,970
correctly they are actually used to just

00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:38,369
combine multi-part words so part time

00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:40,860
there's a hyphen in the middle and end

00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:42,949
dash you need to use the the keyboard

00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:47,100
shortcut for that or there's an HTML

00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:50,879
code and n dash is the shorter of the

00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:56,639
two dashes and it's used in date ranges

00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:59,549
like from 2002-2006 and then to combine

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:04,139
to signal a relationship between words

00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:08,160
so love-hate relationship would have an

00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:13,319
end dash in there an em dash is the

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:16,350
longest most underused I would say of

00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:19,470
them all and this one is to break parts

00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:21,660
of sentences to to create stress on a

00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:25,579
particular thought you would use an em

00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,579
dash to sort of separate that

00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:31,429
this that's often achieved with an

00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,410
ellipsis like the three periods instead

00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:36,139
of an em dash which is the proper way to

00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:38,449
do that so let's just talk about

00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:41,569
ellipses now they're used to indicate

00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:45,109
omission with within quotes and not sort

00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:46,939
of stress specific thoughts it has its

00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:49,489
own little keyboard shortcuts so it's

00:15:46,939 --> 00:15:51,649
actually not three periods a row I'm

00:15:49,489 --> 00:15:54,139
totally guilty of doing that myself but

00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:56,359
not correct because it won't have the

00:15:54,139 --> 00:16:00,949
right amount of spacing between the dot

00:15:56,359 --> 00:16:02,479
and then space before or after the

00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:04,609
ellipses you just sort of feel that out

00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:06,799
like how does it feel to you you put a

00:16:04,609 --> 00:16:15,139
space or if you don't have one is it too

00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:18,169
cramped that's up to so curly quotes I'm

00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:20,059
focusing on curly curly smart quotes and

00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:22,720
not the straight quotes that are just

00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:24,889
the the keyboard button because

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,539
ninety-eight percent of the time when

00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:28,339
you're working with text you want the

00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:30,379
curly quotes that's the actual correct

00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:32,989
one we're talking about like coats and

00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:35,980
tags of course that is not the case but

00:16:32,989 --> 00:16:39,379
we're not talking about that right now

00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:42,519
so you'll want the curly quotes and they

00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:50,809
do have a shortcut and special HTML

00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:54,410
characters and just one quick note is

00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:58,669
when you have like a block of text that

00:16:54,410 --> 00:17:00,709
is in quotation marks you want it to

00:16:58,669 --> 00:17:03,499
hang the punctuation so it's not flush

00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:05,750
with the text because it's not hung it

00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:13,720
fades it just sort of break that up and

00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:17,389
it's harder harder to read selecting

00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:20,059
typefaces you'll want to focus on your

00:17:17,389 --> 00:17:21,649
anchor face so whatever you're using for

00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:23,870
the body copy because that's what you

00:17:21,649 --> 00:17:26,360
have the most of that's what you focus

00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:29,149
on when resources are limited and they

00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,950
they always are the very first thing you

00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:33,320
want to do is read your content because

00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:35,750
you want the typography to match the

00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,150
feel of your content

00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:47,350
and match the brand's voice and tone so

00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:51,590
you you gotta read it when pairing

00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:53,870
typefaces most designers will actually

00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:56,840
tell you to avoid doing this and just

00:17:53,870 --> 00:18:00,410
select a typeface that has a lot of

00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:03,500
different styles um I think it's really

00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:05,000
not very practical we Google font a lot

00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:09,230
like I totally used it for this

00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,060
presentation and when you look at which

00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:13,190
typefaces have that many different

00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:16,580
styles like you need at least like seven

00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:19,790
or eight then there's maybe a handful

00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:22,220
left and then when you I think it was 20

00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:24,080
last time I checked I did check um and

00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,940
so when you immediately eliminate the

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,380
ones that are just a little bit silly

00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,210
and they just don't go with your brand

00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:31,550
you look for the handful and then of

00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:33,200
course there are countless other sites

00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:37,040
that are choosing between the same

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,080
handful of typefaces so there's some

00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,600
things to keep in mind when you're when

00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:44,120
you're pairing typefaces when if you're

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,590
if you have a seraph anchor font then

00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:50,210
you're going to want to choose a SAN

00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:53,540
serif for your display avoid overlapping

00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:55,700
mood so I haven't they make certain type

00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:57,380
a's make you feel something and they

00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,880
have certain characteristics and you

00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,170
don't want to have too much overlap if

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,790
you're going to have to separate

00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:04,730
typefaces they have to be very different

00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:06,860
from each other and of course a weight

00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:08,810
contrast is always visually pleasing and

00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:13,310
that's just going to be a heavier

00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:15,200
typeface so the thickness of it so

00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:17,360
there's no like hard rules but I would

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:22,250
say if there was one it's that you don't

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:23,840
want more than to that it just it just

00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,160
sort of you lose touch with like what

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,190
you're trying to say and with the brands

00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,960
communicating last thing i want to say

00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:32,920
here is you're not on your own there's

00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,510
so many resources to help you choose

00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:38,780
which type face to use and this

00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:40,010
specifically with with google fun these

00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:43,370
are the two that i use in the

00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:48,980
presentation they love each other okay

00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:52,370
so i created a website reference for

00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:54,860
this talk so I have my top 10 topography

00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:58,250
that tips I spared no expense with that

00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:00,500
I was like I need that so it's my top 10

00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:02,270
tips along with the associated resources

00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,070
for those and then there's also a new
