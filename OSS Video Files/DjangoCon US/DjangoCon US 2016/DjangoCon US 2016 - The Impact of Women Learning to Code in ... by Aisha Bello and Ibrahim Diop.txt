Description: 
	The Impact of Women Learning to Code in Developing Countries: Benefits and Challenges by Aisha Bello and Ibrahim Diop

In a continent where more than 75% of the world’s poorest countries are located all with common problems of Economic hardship, electricity issues, lack of water e.t.c and there is a global need to change the narrative not just as individual countries but as a continent. Our leaders try as it may have failed us, nothing seems to be working. The next point of action is to use Technology in whatever form to change our narrative, change our story and enhance our lives.

What better way to go than to go the open source route. Already many initiatives have sprung up recently with PyCon Namibia and DjangoGirls spreading through different African countries. In this talk we highlight how Python education has gradually changed the lives of many women and hope to make suggestions on how such initiatives hope to bridge the technology gender gap in Africa and ultimately how it is being used to change our narrative.

Anywhere in the world, achieving development means going through serious technological changes and innovation. That implies having qualified people to drive those changes. These qualified people exists in most of the developing countries but it’s not enough. It is indeed a sheer case of demand outweighing supply. It is no secret that in Africa there are so many untapped resources with a whooping 60% of the entire population between the ages of 15-25. At this point there is so much potential laying fallow.

Globally there is a talent gap in technology with not enough people with the right skill set to fill in the role with Africa with no exemption. Furthermore, by looking closely, it’s easily noticeable that the majority of technological workforce is the men. There is therefore a considerable opportunity: WOMEN. Unfortunately, because of different reasons especially in Africa where women rights are not given due consideration, and due to unfair treatments, very few women are involved in technology. By consciously making extra efforts to enlighten and bring in more women, we can nearly double the amount of qualified people in technology, create more innovations and progress. This is in fact a no brainer solution

In this talk we would talk about how workshops like Django Girls are helping increase the number of skilled people in technology and also stress the need for to create a lot more similar events and make them more “3rd world friendly” by tackling challenges such as lack of electricity, internet, proper equipment etc. In this talk we would curate information from all DjangoGirls organizers in different African countries to highlight the general challenges faced in organizing python workshops and events in various countries in Africa and also profer solutions and suggestions in tackling these issues To conclude we leave with this quote from Karen Spärck Jones, Professor of Computers and Information at Cambridge Computer Laboratory "I think it's very important to get more women into computing. My slogan is: Computing is too important to be left to men."

come on

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,950
hi everyone we're really happy to be

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,500
here and we'll be talking about the

00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:25,770
impact of involving women in technology

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:34,140
in developing countries anyone many now

00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:35,940
hey guys hi Aisha and it's a real

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,190
pleasure to be here to share the stage

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,410
with Ibrahim and to talk about the

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,980
impact millions who could have on women

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:46,050
and their communities as a home so I'm

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,629
Abraham currently living in Montreal but

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:52,379
I'm also originally from Senegal anuja

00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:54,120
not Nigeria and Mauritania so if you

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,680
guys have any goal to achieve regarding

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,879
diversity in the conference you just

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:03,300
call me and I don't be sad all right so

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:07,979
we last year I attended a jungle girls

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:09,990
event in Bilbao and I spoke about this

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:11,940
journey apartment maybe what happened

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,740
earlier this year which is by doing the

00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,440
second official Python conference in

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,770
Africa the first one being pythons Eddie

00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:23,099
south africa during that event I helped

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:25,979
organize Duggar girls wing Duke and and

00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:28,470
also the Buddha's approach and went I

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:33,630
had sore ganized de vagos biggest event

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:35,640
in Nigeria so i must say that during

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,700
that conference in window we had awesome

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,459
talks and presentation but the highlight

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,020
for me was that django girl workshop so

00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:46,200
just feeling that i was there helping

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,770
and teaching somebody to code was worth

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,830
the two day trip from montrose to window

00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:54,630
the Heather for me though is how dream

00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:58,380
our first encounter with python and

00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:00,599
django the enthusiasm the awesomeness

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,690
the feeling that finally discovered

00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:05,610
myself and i was going i had to help

00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:08,369
many more women experience this

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:12,739
life-changing all-encompassing event of

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,739
teaching a girl like me how to code

00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:18,540
according to statistics women a little

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:22,200
bit more than fifty percent of the

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,330
entire african population because of

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,060
historic and social reasons we met I

00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,069
excluded

00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:30,610
from many separate sectors including

00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:33,459
technology in a society where we have

00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,260
more women than the men how can women

00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:39,160
are often underrepresented in the

00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:42,190
workforce even more so technology let's

00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,900
face it third world countries are the

00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,300
part of the world with the highest

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,610
growth rate but in order to maintain

00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:51,540
that group rate there is a need for more

00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:54,069
innovation and more creation that means

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,650
involving more people and increasing the

00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:58,959
number of women the workforce not

00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,620
involving women would mean keeping us

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:05,319
from nearly half of the population

00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,430
potential so no more women will

00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:09,730
contribute to the growth and the

00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:13,090
development of a country just imagine in

00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:15,069
Africa the potential this has this means

00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,290
that in communities women can actually

00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:19,959
go ahead to solve the immediate problem

00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:24,970
which is not limited to poverty lack of

00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:27,040
electricity of clean water so she she

00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,290
said actually more than fifty percent of

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,910
the population is not considered know I

00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:34,060
don't know about you but I find it to be

00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,950
a very catastrophe especially for

00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,930
developing countries where now is the

00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:42,010
time that actually they need as many

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:45,040
qualified people as they can have so how

00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:47,739
can we get from where we used to be two

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,190
very want to be going to start by

00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:54,489
addressing some current challenges in

00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:56,139
most developing countries this is a

00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:58,540
known fact that access to reliable

00:03:56,139 --> 00:04:00,340
internet is a luxury for many and

00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,620
everyone is not a luxury you find out

00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,090
they and air that you can afford it but

00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:08,980
you're in an area where you don't have

00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:11,620
network coverage also we also know that

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,120
in some traditions you still have cases

00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,549
where boys actually given more

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,100
priorities than ladies when it comes to

00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:22,240
I'm going to even basic elementary

00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:25,419
education there is also a common

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,340
misconception that comes with most

00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:29,169
people feeling like if you want to get

00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,150
good software if you want to get the

00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:33,909
best of it means yeah true you should be

00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:37,930
willing to pay quite a good amount of

00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:38,600
money for it for we know that all I know

00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,120
that

00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,820
some of the best things in life actually

00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,800
come free yeah so this is no disrespect

00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,590
to any company but you know instead of a

00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,750
Windows OS you you have awesome feels

00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:53,120
like the line of distribution or you

00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,500
know instead of Microsoft or video is

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,230
the open office there is an alternative

00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:59,090
which is free and this is a great this

00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,710
is great news for you know developing

00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,300
cultures read the money or the phones

00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:07,310
are not readily available in the first

00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:10,250
place having said that we as a people

00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:13,880
need to be more creative than users of

00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:17,860
Technology in Africa we have a lot of

00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:21,080
any early adopters of Technology and

00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:23,300
this for some reason doesn't you know

00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,070
encourage people to necessarily go under

00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,920
the hood and final you know how this

00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:29,930
technology world so for example if I

00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,000
knew how things work if I knew how

00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:34,940
things work under the hood I will be

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,580
better equipped to teach more people how

00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:41,990
to use this technology and how to become

00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:43,850
creative instead of user so actually

00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,710
some people from a Python group in

00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:49,670
Cameroon reached out to us and they

00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:52,490
mentioned a few problem which are some

00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:55,850
ladies ladies that are between 18 and 22

00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:57,500
are actually more interested in learning

00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:59,540
python or program because they have

00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,300
their parent that are backing them and

00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,520
they don't have any like financial

00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:08,540
charge or something like that and ladies

00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:10,520
that are over 22 would hardly ever even

00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,930
go through the course because we would

00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,820
actually go through the course because

00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:16,700
most of them are already having children

00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:22,340
and taking care of a family and they go

00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:24,230
to that course to actually give them the

00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,000
ability to have a first return of income

00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:28,820
so that they can help themselves and

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,490
their families another reason also is

00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,870
that some ladies are running away from

00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,060
classes that they don't like so

00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,170
university are offering default classes

00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,970
and formation that they don't

00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,800
necessarily like and they're just

00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:44,840
running away from that and go to those

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:48,430
group and learn programming so how can

00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:51,050
we now change everything

00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:52,820
we could change the narrative by

00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:55,400
organizing more and more events like

00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:58,190
this event like Django cons or pecans

00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,820
contribute significantly to in creating

00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:03,470
communities and making them more diverse

00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,720
our thanks to the Django diversity

00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,630
statements more people are involved so

00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,730
what we still need to consider that

00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:13,370
there are a lot of people that we don't

00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:15,680
know actually about and we need to be

00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:19,210
aware that that there's there's a lot of

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,380
people that we actually don't know so

00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:23,510
particularly in developing countries and

00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:26,240
this message goes especially to people

00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:28,430
living in these countries we need to

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,680
encourage people by creating stuff and

00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:36,320
letting them know that they can create

00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:40,190
stuff by their own also involving women

00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:42,800
implies well brain growth involving more

00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:45,350
women means increasing the number of

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,600
tech actors by fifty percent so we'll

00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,980
always say that number fifty percent

00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,470
this is quite a valuable number

00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:54,200
considering the technological need in

00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:59,050
developing countries this obviously

00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:01,850
implies more and better innovation

00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:04,090
diversity or we can say now inclusion

00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:07,250
brings a lot more a point of views and

00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:09,740
more creativity so here's the play from

00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,630
the jungle diversity statement we

00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,370
believe that amazing things happen when

00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,620
people from different words and

00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:18,980
worldviews approach each other and

00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:24,100
create a conversation our technology

00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:29,690
innovation creates development and grow

00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:32,720
education is the king just emphasize how

00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:34,670
much of an impact will both try and talk

00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:39,740
about I would like to give a brief about

00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:43,070
the devil ghost story in Nigeria I I

00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:46,630
might begin first by saying that little

00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:49,640
grim came very late lost the first one

00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:51,980
in organizing jungle Gallegos it brought

00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,740
about the first of the official Piper

00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,360
users group Nigeria it was the first

00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,930
guardian of the Python users group

00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:02,839
preteen exist before so young adult

00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:05,120
event brought about that and also we had

00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:07,910
Tessie eight women attend the jungle

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,480
goals workshop this number initially was

00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:13,370
supposed to be 34 there was just so many

00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,250
amazing applications we had to make

00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:19,339
space for more women to come and take

00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:21,769
advantage of the opportunity and after

00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:24,410
this workshop has been six other

00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:26,959
workshops some going to happen soon some

00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,490
have already happened I just want us to

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,670
take a minute and look at the numbers

00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:33,649
yeah so if we have the way 38 women and

00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:36,940
they got and we have an average of

00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:40,100
twenty-five women in the six other

00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:42,680
locations where other prominent world

00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:47,209
events are coming up that would give us

00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:49,970
a hundred and eighty 180 women from all

00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:53,440
over the country who have been directly

00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:57,829
impacted by the struggle girls movement

00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:00,260
with helen ellen attended a las vegas in

00:09:57,829 --> 00:10:03,079
February and she's a third-year medical

00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:05,690
student and she went ahead to deny

00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:08,570
jungle girls in a Boomer show in our own

00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:10,850
words my motivation for going into the

00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:13,430
tech world was to integrate technology

00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:15,260
into health to prevent as many deaths as

00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:17,690
possible and nursing the powers of

00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:20,000
technology I did not take this seriously

00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:23,630
until earlier this year when I attended

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,430
jungle girl Helen now as just applied

00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:27,290
for an internship in a software

00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:31,070
development company improve our skills

00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:35,839
so that she can achieve this dream more

00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:38,570
about meat mercy aka mama Jambo she's

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,850
forbid code in our school she's the

00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:43,610
second year convey design student and

00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:45,709
organizer of jungle girls after and

00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,350
after a workshop this was what she had

00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:50,630
to see the workshop was successful the

00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:53,269
girls wanted more of it they were

00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:55,370
inspired to food people kept asking me

00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:57,500
what next my lecturers were impressed

00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,720
and they kept telling me to continue

00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,089
that's what what prompted me to then I

00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,490
did three days code times which will be

00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:06,709
coming up in august I want to say thank

00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,540
you to jungle God for allowing me be a

00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:11,600
part of something

00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:15,440
before he has a different kind of impact

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:19,280
midterm Eva she's a software co

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,830
conditioner assurance analyst and now

00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,890
jungle gold lagos organizer and pi

00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:26,660
ladies nigeria organizer she's also

00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:30,580
looking to switch into the software

00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:32,390
development field so after the event

00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,160
really this was what she had to say

00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:36,350
after the event i started to walk

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,570
through the jungle tutorials and I go a

00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,880
better understanding of the mood of view

00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:42,500
controller this maybe understand the

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,810
internals of the application I was

00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,120
testing our work that's all I also

00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:49,610
started to check out how python and

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,650
django can make my test more efficient

00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:54,320
and i discovered selenium and gruber

00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:57,140
framework and brought up my testers have

00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,320
become much more efficient now these

00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:02,560
three examples goes to highlight the

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,930
different ways or the different areas

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:09,140
the impact of a single workshop can have

00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:12,140
in the lives of that many women it

00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:14,180
doesn't just propel them forward but it

00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,980
gives them the confidence to take

00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:20,480
advantage of any opportunity as it

00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:23,570
presents itself so like I mentioned

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,090
earlier we have we have Europe some

00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:28,250
peculiar programs in Africa book most of

00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:31,400
these problems actually commonly I even

00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:33,710
find organize these events so like

00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,830
almighty internet that is just like the

00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:38,720
basic of basics without it you can't

00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:41,030
even go to stop overflow you know google

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,830
that outside you know ask your question

00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:46,010
and like go and ask Google things like

00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:47,480
that so it's it's the basic and it's a

00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:49,540
problem because during these workshops

00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,970
we have this room and trying to you know

00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:55,400
pull or push to get hub price of coffee

00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,960
or Python anywhere and you know what L

00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,740
internet there is there's only so much

00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,330
they can't do but we've also had

00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,370
problems where we've had electricity

00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:08,210
issues where the power dose goes out in

00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:10,880
the middle of a training and I'm just so

00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:13,160
you guys know some of the laptops we

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,410
have back home I usually like really old

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,300
and the budget and also amazing the call

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,160
them purified TV sets because moment

00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:21,209
power goes out you don't go off right so

00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,819
there's no battery power ready

00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:24,959
so yeah so imagine how for sure thing

00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:30,149
that can be when you're trying to work

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:33,269
at you know just goes up and so in try

00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:34,709
not to have to let many people I said

00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:38,129
interest at the same time and you know

00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:41,639
try to reduce the load we have we have

00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:43,829
we preload these tutorials with preload

00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:46,470
the applications and you get B drive and

00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:49,410
we try to share it to everyone so for

00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:51,509
example there is a flash drive I take it

00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:53,910
from me Brian I take it on my computer

00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:55,980
and yeah just so you know we have more

00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:58,889
windows users that maybe Mac or Linux

00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,869
users in this part of the world to know

00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:02,550
I'm taking a sludge drag have getting

00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:04,350
these viruses on my own computer and

00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,179
when I'm trying to give it to someone

00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:09,809
else I'm giving them both are viruses on

00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:13,470
the computer said it's not sharing of

00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:17,670
love honestly it's just king or 60 it's

00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:20,249
not healthy another impending problem is

00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:22,350
that many times this woman cannot even

00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:25,350
afford computers they don't have

00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:27,749
computer so they always have to go to a

00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:30,299
friend burl after just to attend this

00:14:27,749 --> 00:14:31,799
workshop I don't know about you boss if

00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:33,329
I have to worry laptops attend the

00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:36,959
workshop I go back home and I give this

00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:38,429
up top bar yeah they're people that you

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,079
know you're resilient and you're going

00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:41,999
to go back amber the laptop and made as

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,160
as possible to you know get cracky work

00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:45,689
the same time it's still a problem is

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,509
still not you know these are basic

00:14:45,689 --> 00:14:50,369
necessity that you didn't even beam what

00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:52,980
I actually experienced the same problem

00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:55,499
in the jungle girl workshop we had in

00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:58,529
window one of the ladies didn't have a

00:14:55,499 --> 00:15:02,069
laptop so i had to lend her mind so she

00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:04,049
can actually continue or term to finish

00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:06,110
the workshop but after that I don't know

00:15:04,049 --> 00:15:08,309
if actually she would continue on her

00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:11,339
programming during rights but that's

00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:16,889
another small prob major problem that we

00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:18,449
have but other than negative stuff we

00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:21,089
have positive stuff also we have a lot

00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:23,129
of growing communities so we are

00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:25,860
witnessing growing African Python groups

00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:28,410
after events like Python anivia

00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:31,259
communities like Python Zimbabwe and

00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:33,269
Python Zambia were born and that's

00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:34,480
without counting all the jungle girls on

00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:37,680
me that were held in different

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,720
it is a lot in Nigeria some in Kampala

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,970
there is also a Python community in

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,860
South Africa which can be considered as

00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:47,139
the most established one in Africa right

00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,420
now they organized earlier Python

00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:51,699
conference and this year is going to be

00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:57,550
in october six and seven in Cape Town so

00:15:51,699 --> 00:16:00,430
you guys are all invited and now if you

00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:01,779
want to know stuff about like Python

00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:04,329
communities in Africa there is no

00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:07,269
mailing lists Python Africa you can

00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:09,279
register it's open to anyone we are

00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:10,870
actually doing our best it's been here

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,240
for six months now and we're doing our

00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:15,699
best to gather all African python

00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:20,889
communities together so actually we can

00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:23,050
work together and do better stuff but

00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:25,149
you also can help all of us can help

00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:27,190
right because I stake actors we have to

00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:31,420
adapt or products for all whether it's

00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:34,029
an event hardware or software there is

00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:36,820
also a need for more Django girls or PI

00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:38,800
ladies like events now another

00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:41,529
interesting fact is that programming

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,620
needs to be promoted differently when we

00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:47,290
think about programming it is a as if it

00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:49,779
has been tailored for men with glasses

00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:51,220
in front of computer or video games so

00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:54,550
that's pretty much how it looked like

00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:56,889
right but that's not all an example in

00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:58,779
the University of Berkeley clearly shows

00:16:56,889 --> 00:17:01,060
that appearance is important so by

00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:03,790
actually renaming one of their class

00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:05,799
title from introduction to symbolic

00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:08,230
programming to beauty and the joy of

00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:11,110
computing they increased female

00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:14,470
attendants by fifty percent that's right

00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:17,579
oh I have one what if we named winning

00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:23,579
the I pipe into a pink Python oh boo

00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:23,579
people using it know about that but yeah

00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,470
yeah so also this um I actually this is

00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,929
a google image search for the word

00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:34,720
programmer and if you actually what we

00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:38,320
see it's just men's glasses screens

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,750
computers I will try that in a dot ng

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:44,650
that you're the UK

00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:47,590
same Teresa so yeah well you know what I

00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:54,960
put on it and also look like this and

00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:54,960
it's not boring easy thank you thank you

00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:08,250
it's for a wonderful talk um when we're

00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:09,780
writing documentation or contributing to

00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,880
open source projects in the Django

00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,530
community you mentioned an example like

00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,110
just changing the title of something

00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:18,210
make it more welcoming are there any

00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:19,920
resources or advice you have for us when

00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:22,560
we're writing documentation and making

00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,960
contributions that are maybe particular

00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,760
to communities in Africa featured in

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,490
your time yes I've been thinking about

00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,170
that particularly because a lot of

00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:33,510
people are not aware that you can

00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:36,180
actually now right in traditional like

00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:38,730
local language like house' or Swahili or

00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,590
Yoruba so when we know that we can

00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,930
actually contact people and ask them to

00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,580
contribute to documentation so if for

00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:46,710
example the Django documentation was

00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:50,190
written house I it would maybe bring

00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:53,040
more also ladies or people in general so

00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:55,140
that's one of the way to help and also

00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,900
the other way to help is actually to

00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:59,130
learn about people so it's actually when

00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,350
you know about people that you can

00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:03,810
customize something so that it would be

00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:06,090
a more attractive to those kind of

00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:13,260
people so yeah that's kind of the advice

00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:15,120
I have for them I'm your experience

00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,880
those students that you teach are they

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,910
trying to augment like their education

00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,550
in computer science are they trying to

00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:26,700
start new businesses with their skills

00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:28,140
that they learn how are they using like

00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,180
what they learned in your classes yeah

00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,640
so we have a little bit of both like

00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:35,670
everyone different kinds of women so we

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,620
have yeah we know most times in

00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:40,050
universities even where you go to learn

00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:43,500
come to science you actually learn how

00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:45,510
to code on your blackboard Annie mark I

00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,370
like there is no computer sometimes and

00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:49,440
you know you're printing and debugging

00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:52,080
on the plugboard yes sir I mean

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,580
workshops like this comes to come to

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,710
play in helping them arguments you know

00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:57,420
that competition of Education that it

00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:00,390
kind of gets in school and you also have

00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:03,060
women in I mean I don't know if you know

00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:05,160
this book most African women a very

00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,600
entrepreneurial so most of them are

00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,040
trying to see how this technology can

00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,540
help them in their businesses you know

00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,779
everything's are trying to do a website

00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:14,330
for my my fashion business or

00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:17,479
make up for my beauty business yeah so

00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:20,499
we have a lot a lot of book actually so

00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:22,429
I guess follow-up question from

00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:25,399
entrepreneurship versus like how

00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:28,429
involved are local businesses in these

00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:31,369
workshops are they like helping fund or

00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:33,200
are they helping like send students and

00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:37,009
to these workshops at all or is it more

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:39,519
so just word of mouth do you mean like

00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:42,320
local entrepreneurial businesses or like

00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:45,979
businesses like companies businesses

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,859
like companies that are already oh yeah

00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:51,409
just a women that want to you know like

00:20:48,859 --> 00:20:53,989
start their own businesses funny enough

00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:55,820
most of the people currently I'm going

00:20:53,989 --> 00:20:59,059
to use my experience that we've had like

00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:01,339
really home support immediately start up

00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:04,609
companies the big names and big

00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:06,229
organizations they're not really direct

00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:08,479
maybe maybe because it's the part of the

00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:11,149
world were in in a bag but here they're

00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:14,330
not really really responsive there's a

00:21:11,149 --> 00:21:17,359
nice dog thanks so much um my question

00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:19,789
is when you approached all these women

00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:21,019
when they want to learn you talk about

00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:23,149
all this problem that they're facing

00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:24,349
when they want to learn but have you

00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:26,330
ever encountered an attitude problem

00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:28,609
from the side of the people or you're

00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:30,529
actually trying to focus on because even

00:21:28,609 --> 00:21:32,210
before Django girls initiative started

00:21:30,529 --> 00:21:34,070
and even before I was actually exposed

00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:35,389
to this for programming community and

00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:37,279
the problems over there I used to do

00:21:35,389 --> 00:21:40,729
workshops at college for students all of

00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:42,589
them and this is funny and I didn't

00:21:40,729 --> 00:21:44,929
understand any of this at that point but

00:21:42,589 --> 00:21:46,070
when I actually encourage all of these

00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:47,809
students to come and attend a workshop

00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:49,759
they used to be just like two or three

00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:52,249
women students like girl students at my

00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:53,839
workshops and one day I actually took

00:21:52,249 --> 00:21:55,879
the time to go and ask they just AM like

00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:57,409
I sent you a personal invite at only

00:21:55,879 --> 00:21:59,089
this is what you're learning I told you

00:21:57,409 --> 00:22:01,549
this is how it will be used for why

00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:04,369
didn't you attend and they sort of said

00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:06,289
unanimously as I they gave me the reply

00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:07,879
that we're just here so that we can get

00:22:06,289 --> 00:22:10,789
a degree and sort of get a better

00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:12,919
husband and that that was my impression

00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:14,960
before I was exposed to all of these

00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:16,369
things which is considerably changed so

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,889
have you ever encountered that sort of

00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:20,989
an attitude problem or how you know

00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:25,600
women are told that what they're

00:22:20,989 --> 00:22:27,490
learning will help them yeah actually

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,190
like I said before this guy from

00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:32,650
Cameroon say that most of the ladies

00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:35,049
they come there while some of them are

00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:38,440
eager to learn but most of them they

00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:39,960
come to earn another degree or find a

00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,059
better job but they don't actually

00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:45,610
understand the value of programming so

00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:47,169
for me the real value of it is that you

00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:50,289
can create stuff you can help people

00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:52,240
with that and this is a challenge you

00:22:50,289 --> 00:22:54,039
have to let them know that you can use

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,890
programming to create stuff and to help

00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:58,900
their own selves instead of actually

00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:01,419
learning programming to find a better

00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,909
job they can learn programming to find

00:23:01,419 --> 00:23:07,240
solutions to local problem water

00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:09,010
electricity and so on yeah attitude

00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:12,370
level you need to have that change from

00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:14,200
that and even at that you could do it

00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:16,210
the way you can actually turn this

00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,100
attitude level sweet it's still about

00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:21,789
understanding them or what appeals to

00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:26,049
them so it could be like for example the

00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:27,640
cookbook you know she has so if that is

00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:29,620
what appeals to them so you're going to

00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,120
use what they love and they better

00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,860
understand when you speak in their

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,289
language the same way they have

00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:37,120
businesses and some of them do run to

00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:38,830
their businesses on Instagram these are

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,780
several a huge facebook they still use

00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:42,039
technology but you do know that they can

00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,570
actually you know just learn how to

00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:46,659
build your own website and do it

00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:49,299
ourselves right so you still yes that's

00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:51,220
a su programa de ago you can still use

00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:53,590
that to understand them and Taillow you

00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:55,210
know how you approach them yes so

00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:57,909
instead of saying oh come on learn how

00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:59,169
to code I could just say oh once a boy

00:23:57,909 --> 00:24:00,789
your business want to get as millions

00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:02,980
and their customers as you can sign up

00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:10,419
and learn how to view on web site yet so

00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:11,950
that could be away thank you hey um so I

00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:14,950
know you mentioned in your talk that

00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:18,250
when the big I guess roadblocks for I

00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:20,830
guess teaching Django girls workshop is

00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:22,750
the lack of computers a lot of us work

00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,730
at companies and after a while like our

00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:27,159
old workstations they either get

00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:29,559
recycled or sent some way is there a way

00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:31,630
for like companies I guess to donate

00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:34,630
their old workstations or laptops to

00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:38,370
jingle girls or your specific branch oh

00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:38,370
yes there is a

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,110
you should talk after this to chicago

00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,090
video okay so even during the last

00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:47,880
offshore broncos i got i didn't appeal

00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:49,890
that cuz then some does emailed me and

00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,480
said that they lost your laptop so deep

00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:52,950
they were going to borough I think

00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,750
they're like three different ladies are

00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:57,080
emailed me and I said a Twitter campaign

00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:59,220
like just a week to the workshop and

00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,200
surprisingly someone from the Python

00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,910
Niger community had to laughter from

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,190
your company and just brought it I gave

00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:07,710
gave it actually wrote about it in a

00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:09,960
blog post it would be brought us to the

00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:12,030
lady's eyes like you don't know what it

00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,280
means to have a lot of it's a big deal

00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:15,930
many of us can take you for granted but

00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,790
is a big deal and it's a really good

00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:20,250
long way so yes if you comment got

00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:21,930
laptops please there are lots of loads

00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:24,380
of people who need them back in

00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:30,030
developing countries like Nigeria sir

00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:32,520
thank you thanks for your talk for those

00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:34,650
of us who are who have python and django

00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,170
communities near us is easy to be

00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:38,730
involved but for those of us who aren't

00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:41,280
aren't physically on the African

00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:44,520
continent what are some ways that we can

00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,260
contribute to helping enhance the women

00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,400
and people in general in Africa learn to

00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,960
program and enhance their programming

00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,010
say look what are things that we can do

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,950
to contribute even if we're not

00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:56,220
physically in Africa actually that's my

00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:57,800
case i'm living in montreal so for me

00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:00,240
one of the good things to do is

00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,940
participate in local event so don't cook

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,190
encourage local jungle girls or hike on

00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:07,170
events locally and also to talk about

00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:09,720
these things so making people aware that

00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:14,400
there are other programmers elsewhere in

00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:17,250
on the planet yeah if it also support us

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,840
like you know if you could 12 for

00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:20,490
example we're trying to do this

00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,290
mentorship thing where the girls have

00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:24,450
mentors both you know they can also

00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:27,960
connect with mentor that are not within

00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:31,140
Nigeria sir if you'd like to mentor you

00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:33,480
it's also an assured if you your company

00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:37,400
is Bella probably and only using C send

00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:41,390
it over the different way back to me

00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,390
yeah thank you

00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:45,620
