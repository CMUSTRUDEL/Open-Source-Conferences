Description: 
	DjangoCon US 2016 - It is Darkest Before Dawn: Alcoholism and Addiction in Tech (CW) (TW) by Timothy Allen

Technology professionals have been in high demand for several decades, and this demand for talent has caused a culture to emerge that often turns a blind eye to those who may be struggling with alcoholism and addiction. We have to come together to avoid this "petri dish" continuing to exist, by watching out for ourselves, and one another. The CDC estimates that ten percent of Americans suffer from the disease of addiction, and only nine percent of addicts ever receive treatment. This "petri dish" of technology culture makes it even harder for those of us with careers in the field.

Recovery can be a wonderful journey for those of us who suffer from the disease, and I hope by sharing some of my journey, people will take a step back and consider what we can do to improve the culture for everyone.

Content warnings: this will be frank discussion that may involve colorful language, and topics including drug and alcohol abuse, death from addiction and sexual abuse.

I tend to be a little loud and do some

00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,369
wild gesticulations so please bear with

00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:22,869
me if I go a little overboard or I'm a

00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:24,369
little loud but I do want to start with

00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:26,860
a Content warning and a trigger warning

00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:29,020
right up front this talk is going to

00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,150
discuss alcohol and drug use and some

00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,550
frank sexual discussions nothing

00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,870
gratuitous but these conversations

00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,210
really aren't easy when we're talking

00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,980
about a progressive deadly disease and

00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,899
that's what addiction is so if you're

00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:43,450
uncomfortable please don't hesitate to

00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:45,010
leave at any point I don't want anyone

00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:48,970
to feel uncomfortable and I will not be

00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:52,780
offended so without further ado so I'm

00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:54,250
Tim as Mikhail said I'm an IT director

00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,990
of advanced initiatives at the word

00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,780
that's cool forward and research data

00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:01,480
services you can find me everywhere as

00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:04,509
Philip or PA I'm a Python ista and

00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,909
Django nut I'm a Django con organizer

00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:09,189
i'm the wharton liaison I'm a fun-loving

00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:11,880
nerd a hockey fan and a guitarist and

00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:14,920
I'm also an alcoholic addict in recovery

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,960
I'm really glad to be here today in

00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,480
recovery we take one day at a time

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,090
I truly believe two bookends to Ron's

00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:25,690
talk that we are all extremely lucky to

00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:27,460
get paid to do what we love for some

00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,960
context this talk was first given at

00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,610
BarCamp fili in a slightly different

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,060
form which it's a highlight of my year

00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:35,950
last November and I want to get it right

00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:39,580
out that being an addict is just part of

00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:42,820
what makes me me this disease can really

00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:47,200
affect everybody in recovery we say from

00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:49,780
Yale to jail but here I in Philadelphia

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,290
I like to modify that from state pen to

00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,290
Penn State

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,540
and there there will be some laughs in

00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,579
this as well so feel free to laugh at my

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,310
high school and college fashion choices

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:04,170
as we go through but it is a serious

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,939
topic and chances are there are a fair

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,550
number of people struggling with this

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:10,890
disease here today now I should have

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,540
said spoiler alert in the last key note

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,880
before I shared this part of the story

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,950
about Simon but I grew up with two

00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,250
loving parents and a little sister hi

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,930
Mariana both my parents are academics

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,269
foreign language teachers and I had a

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,459
thing for computer languages so again I

00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:28,380
consider myself extremely lucky and

00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,780
privileged I was really born on third

00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,510
base in baseball terms I lived here in

00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,640
University City I went to st. Mary's

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,590
nursery school growing up which is the

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,480
Django Khan childcare provider we

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,840
provide child care and had a pretty

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:46,319
normal middle-class childhood my

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,260
godfather uncle Charlie was actually

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,610
quite a computer scientist in 1974 the

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,769
year I was born he wrote a book called

00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,080
an introduction to the theory of

00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:57,060
computing and was the guy who wrote the

00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,269
assembly code on the chip of the memory

00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,489
game Simon that you can see behind me so

00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:04,350
I remember being very young being around

00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:07,709
computers 8-inch floppy disks

00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:09,269
double-sided back in the day and it

00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:12,150
wasn't long my dad brought home a

00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:15,120
computer when I was 7 an IBM PC 88 with

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:19,230
2 5 an inch quarter full height floppy

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,690
drives and soon after that I got my own

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,700
computer when I was about 12 and soon

00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,310
after that started a BBS which is what

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,980
we did before the internet existed

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:31,470
we'd add up to one another was called a

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,000
well intense white dragon and I still

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,670
remember the number it was two one five

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,200
eight seven nine one six eight two so I

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,510
often wonder if the people who have that

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:45,390
number now actually still get the dial

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:48,360
up the horrible beat so you know I had a

00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:53,040
pretty very very very lucky privileged

00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:55,709
upbringing fast forward to when I was

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,750
twelve I loved my comfort zone of

00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:00,750
University City and my parents moved out

00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,580
toward the suburbs and I had never

00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,220
really felt like I fit in at school or

00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,900
anywhere and this is a recurring theme

00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,830
you'll hear amongst attics you know my

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:13,590
computer was my best friend in many ways

00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:15,270
my BBS was getting pretty popular and I

00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,980
met a lot of other local BBS sirs

00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,780
including some of the programmers behind

00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:22,890
the BBS system I used at the time the

00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:25,560
Phoenix BBS unfortunately at about that

00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:29,730
age I was abused by one of the older

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:32,340
programmers when I was 13 I completely

00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:34,620
hid it for many many years and this is

00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,190
part of what kind of started a cycle of

00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,830
shame and hiding things from from people

00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:43,260
for many many years I started drinking

00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,090
in smoking marijuana in high school and

00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,070
because of this I started to feel like I

00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:49,410
belonged in circles social circles

00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:51,090
really for the first time we didn't have

00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:55,320
meetup groups back then for computer

00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:58,740
geeks Dungeons & Dragons was about one

00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:01,800
of my few social outlets so it was

00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:06,780
difficult when we fast forward to

00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:09,060
college feel free to laugh little noon

00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,970
to me I was a prime Khattak candidate to

00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,690
become an alcoholic addict I started

00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:17,370
drinking and doing drugs every day and

00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:18,930
this was about the same time I began to

00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,560
open up about the abuse I had gone

00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:24,450
through so I was exploring like many of

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,390
us do in college and alcohol and drugs

00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:30,320
helped me be social I was popular and

00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:32,610
accepted for the first time ever I

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,470
wasn't always the greatest student but

00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:37,260
I'd always loved computers so as heavily

00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,120
invested in my major and got heavily

00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,880
involved in the early Internet

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,110
and the web I started a site called

00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,090
filly music.com

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,479
in the mid 90s which was the first

00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:50,820
organized local music scene on the web

00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:52,410
which eventually grew into a PHP MySQL

00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,600
site after starting with server-side

00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:57,720
includes the height of technology at the

00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,449
time and somehow I managed to graduate

00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,550
on time which was another start of

00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:04,770
something called denial because I

00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:06,830
couldn't be an alcoholic I graduated on

00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:09,120
time you know I did well with my

00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,070
customized computer science degree that

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,800
measure that put together computer

00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,030
science and psychology or how I like to

00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,960
refer to them now how to mess with

00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:20,789
people's heads Part A and Part B I was

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:25,470
convinced I grow out of it someday you

00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:27,600
know I was just being young so I did the

00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:30,240
logical thing and I moved to

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,030
Jacksonville Florida to get away from it

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:38,430
all for a job Jacksonville is the worst

00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:40,860
place on the planet there is absolutely

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:43,139
no diversity down there the tech scene

00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,880
was horrible but it did manage to clean

00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:47,820
me up a little bit but the drinking was

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,470
always there the drinking hung on I got

00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,000
off you know I stopped doing some of the

00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,010
harder drugs I had gotten into you by

00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,930
that point but the drinking and the

00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:57,180
socializing it was still such a crutch

00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,500
for me to be able to socialize with

00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,270
people to be able to break down the

00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,789
barriers to be able to talk to other

00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:04,889
people and to be accepted by people at

00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:06,750
the bar that's why people do drink so

00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:10,139
often is because if you think about it

00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:11,490
and misrepresentation was referenced in

00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,979
our last talk there's another great

00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:16,349
documentary called the mask you live in

00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:18,810
done by the same directors and film

00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:20,880
producers which talks about how men are

00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:24,120
taught to suppress their emotions from a

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,949
very young age if your age 5 and you're

00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,070
crying in public it's a problem if

00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:31,560
you're crying at age 10 watch out we are

00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:34,560
trained to do this from the time we grow

00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,560
up and it's to the detriment of all of

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,060
us now think about guys at the bar it's

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,440
the one time they'll sell say things

00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,620
like I love you bro

00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,930
well yeah or you know actually cry or

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,719
open up about their emotions this

00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:51,150
addiction cycle is partially I believe

00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:52,500
responsible because of how much we we

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,710
suppress our moose

00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,870
so don't have actual conversations about

00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:01,410
what we are feeling what we are doing

00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:05,340
and it affects both men and women moving

00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:06,840
on to my career CD now a great place to

00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,790
work it was a great place to start but

00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:12,750
they had beer on tap in the tech

00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:15,480
department and lots of drinking so of

00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,190
course you know the the location once

00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,420
again had to be my drinking problem it

00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,830
couldn't be Philadelphia can be

00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:23,190
Jacksonville looking to be the company I

00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:25,050
was at it had to be me but I was still

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,320
in denial about it being the place I was

00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,150
at

00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:31,440
so I thought a bank would be a more

00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:35,159
straight-laced place to work I was

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,599
incorrect it was a interesting start up

00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:40,080
of a bank I actually got to design a

00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:42,690
bank for David Bowie which I had a Bowie

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,219
card for a little while the CEO kind of

00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,260
looked like William Shatner kind of

00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:49,140
acted like William Shatner and kept a

00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:51,060
bottle of vodka in my desk back in the

00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,880
tech department that he would pop off to

00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:56,520
have a sip from during board meetings so

00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,260
it was really not not a great place for

00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,600
an alcoholic to work but you know we

00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:03,390
talked about there being a lot of

00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,860
alcoholism in the tech industry but then

00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,270
I think about it we also talked about

00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,970
there being a lot of drinking and

00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,380
lawyers construction I mean try to if

00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,570
they're an industry that doesn't have it

00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,940
maybe if you're a door-to-door Mormon

00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,980
religion salesman that might be the one

00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,230
but really there is a heavy drinking

00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,970
culture in every industry it's not just

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,610
tech we are just at a higher risk

00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:27,240
because of the behaviors that we tend to

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:28,740
engage in so I started my own companies

00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,240
I've started two companies and taken

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,860
them to sale the first one digital

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,410
content solutions got bought up by a

00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,120
local company called chrome Co that not

00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:40,680
only a beer on tap they had a Jager

00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:44,490
machine in the garage so literally every

00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:47,190
stop I had until Wharton had a very very

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,890
heavy drinking culture now I'm not

00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,890
blaming the company's tech just has this

00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,660
culture which is literally a petri dish

00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:56,760
for addiction it's filled with

00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:59,940
temptations for alcoholics and addicts

00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,530
at every turn we used to back at seedy

00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,230
now before going to an all-you-can-eat

00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:06,010
Chinese buffet we are translating the

00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,530
site for many different languages and

00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:10,780
would have a Afghani translation meeting

00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:12,430
at about 11:30 a.m. on Fridays where we

00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:14,440
would smoke pot in the parking lot and

00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,390
then go to an all-you-can-eat Chinese

00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:21,430
buffet do the math we got our money's

00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:23,410
worth but alcoholism has followed me

00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:27,550
despite all these changes of scenery

00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:30,580
it's my disease to own and I clearly was

00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:32,920
not growing out of drinking I had been

00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:36,820
pretty successful which gave me a big

00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:38,650
form of denial my career in technology

00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,600
you know I worked in tech and on the

00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:42,280
Philly Tech scene since 1996 I've

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,190
started three companies taking to to

00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:48,580
sales I mentioned I started the SLCC the

00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:50,440
Second Life Community Convention in 2005

00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:53,020
which became the biggest virtual worlds

00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,400
convention in the world I served at the

00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,560
vice president of Panama the

00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,390
Philadelphia area new media Association

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,760
if you're from the Philadelphia area I

00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:02,710
highly recommend checking it out and I

00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,410
was also the cards the co-chair of

00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:07,390
BarCamp Philadelphia which is still the

00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:10,120
largest and most active bar camp in the

00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:12,520
nation as well as helping run the

00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,530
wharton web conference right here i was

00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:17,440
a contributor to open source projects

00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:19,450
and the funny thing is if anybody

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,640
treated me the way i was treating myself

00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:26,860
at the time i'd be in prison for murder

00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:30,040
alcohol fueled creativity is such a

00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:33,430
total myth having hackathons at bars

00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,110
i've done it you know James Joyce said

00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:38,430
right drunk at it sober and we had

00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:42,010
modified that to code drunk debug server

00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:45,220
it's really total BS this myth of the

00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:48,580
rock star programmer is one that just

00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:51,130
needs to die because for me everything

00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,600
became a reason to drink a promotion at

00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:56,290
work a friend gonna raise a business

00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,970
deal got done drink a problem at work a

00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:01,060
friend got fired a business seal did not

00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:03,220
go through drink coworkers are going out

00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:06,160
drink death in the family drink my

00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:08,230
nephew was born drink I was drinking

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,810
when I found out my nephew was born I

00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:13,540
was having a party I missed his first

00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:15,960
birthday because I was hungover I called

00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:18,310
my family and said I was too sick to go

00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,390
little did I know I was actually telling

00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:22,720
the truth then

00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:26,440
I was sick I have a disease it's a

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,810
deadly progressive disease his second

00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,270
birthday I was in rehab and I wrote him

00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:33,370
a letter because my uncle has this

00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,060
disease and just celebrated 30 years

00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,070
sober

00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:38,260
I have this disease I do not know if my

00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,970
nephew is gonna get this disease but I

00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,400
do want to have a conversation with him

00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,540
at some point about it and know he can

00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,850
always talk about me

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,400
the shame continued to build I was

00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:50,950
successful but I was in denial after

00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,260
every flier season or local hockey team

00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:55,390
ended I would try to take a month off

00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,630
from drinking with varying degrees of

00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:00,580
success

00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:02,980
so Brene brown is a professor at the

00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,630
University of Houston's Graduate School

00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:07,810
of Social Work and she is considered a

00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:09,300
leading researcher on shame I've become

00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:11,350
a big fan since I've been in recovery

00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,600
shame is one of the most primitive

00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:15,940
emotions and no one wants to talk about

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,160
it and shame can quietly marinate over a

00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:21,730
lifetime so here are some of her quotes

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,760
on shame I think shame is deadly and I

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,980
think we are swimming in it deep the

00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:30,670
bless you talk about it the more you got

00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:35,740
it shame depends on buying into the

00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:39,550
belief that you are alone shame cannot

00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:43,330
survive being spoken shame cannot

00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:45,820
survive empathy empathy and altruism are

00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:48,520
absolute keys to a strong community and

00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:50,680
the amount I've witnessed here at django

00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,780
con and within the django community is

00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,480
absolutely amazing the fact we can have

00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,550
these conversations these absolutely

00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,500
wonderful conversations that are

00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:01,780
difficult but need to happen as russ

00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,720
showed us last year with this talk on

00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:08,170
depression are ones we must have to

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,270
really have a healthy community let's

00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:14,380
consider the stigma around alcoholism

00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:17,410
for a moment i can have a beer at lunch

00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:19,660
right it is friday alcoholic at the

00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:23,680
table would you smoke in front of a

00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:27,310
cancer patient you blacked out because

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,660
you were wasted that was hilarious would

00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,250
you think it was hilarious of somebody

00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,640
with Alzheimer's didn't recall something

00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:35,110
these are diseases

00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,840
why don't you just try beer no hard

00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:41,770
stuff yeah cuz addicts are obviously

00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:43,510
great with limits the stigma that makes

00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:46,090
it really hard for people with this

00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:48,490
disease to get help it is not a question

00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:51,340
of willpower any more than you can will

00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:53,560
another disease to go away I avoided

00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,930
recovery for years after knowing I had a

00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:58,330
problem because of the whole god thing

00:14:54,930 --> 00:15:00,070
which was just an excuse you know I told

00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,660
you about taking a month off after the

00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:03,670
Flyers were eliminated from the playoffs

00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:06,370
that was one of multiple attempts to

00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:08,110
stop and you know really just another

00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:10,530
form of denial oh I can stop for a

00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:13,420
couple weeks I must not be an alcoholic

00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:17,140
that said I will take this disease over

00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:21,370
any other I don't have cancer I don't

00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:25,120
have AIDS my medicine is that I get

00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:28,300
together get to get together with a

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,280
bunch of friends for an hour and talk

00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:35,980
about my biggest problem and my favorite

00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:38,140
subject me so some uncomfortable facts

00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:40,330
to consider one in six Americans binge

00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,100
drink four or more times a month by CDC

00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:44,200
estimates and that number is higher in

00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,240
technology circles for me it became

00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,160
daily or every other day I'd party all

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,840
weekend long sometimes into money I'd be

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,170
the one planning the party after work

00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,180
happy hour with co-workers you know

00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:57,610
they'd go home like normal Earthlings

00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:59,740
and you know I'd go on to the dirtiest

00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:02,590
dizziest dive bar I could find in South

00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:04,630
Philly eating off and became an

00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:06,370
afterthought and you know when you start

00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:09,100
getting text messages from bartenders at

00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:10,750
7:05 a.m. on a Saturday saying you're

00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:14,640
late that's what's known as a hidden

00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:17,350
indicator it might be time to get help

00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,790
excessive drinking costs America two

00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,290
hundred and fifty five billion dollars

00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,300
in crime medical care and lost

00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:24,310
productivity animal annually

00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,750
you know I'd avoid missing work because

00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:28,480
that might mean I'm an alcoholic

00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,970
I've also always loved what I do so I

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:35,110
really threw myself into my career as a

00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:36,970
way to justify my bad behavior by saying

00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:38,800
oh I've got a full-time job I'm doing

00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,510
well at work that was the one thing I

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,880
could hang on to that would get me

00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:45,310
through I made sure to keep up

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,800
appearances and always perform I mean

00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:53,110
calendar appointments in my phone so I

00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:55,029
didn't forget anything one in every 10

00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:57,910
Americans over the age of 12 is addicted

00:16:55,029 --> 00:17:00,250
to alcohol or drugs roughly equal to the

00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:01,779
entire population of Texas this is why

00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,620
it's so important that we have these

00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:05,230
conversations

00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:07,959
I drank heavily from the age of 18 to 40

00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:11,560
this disease is deadly and progressive

00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:14,170
and there is help out there so of that

00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:17,260
population the size of Texas only 11

00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:21,730
percent ever received treatment my

00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:26,079
sobriety kate is April 12th 2015 it was

00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:27,880
the last day of PyCon 2015 i saw a talk

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,700
by jacob kaplan mouse called the talent

00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,590
myth calling talking about the myth of

00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,690
the rockstar developer an amazing talk

00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:37,390
go watch it on youtube after we're done

00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:39,430
here it's really an absolutely must

00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:42,670
watch for everybody everybody on the

00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:44,020
planet let alone our community this

00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:48,400
helped put me I'm not saying Jacob

00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:50,110
capital muffs got me sober what I am

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,360
saying is that it put me in the right

00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:54,040
mindset so that I had had a great week

00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,410
at PyCon but it involved a lot of heavy

00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,610
drinking and Jacobs talk put me in the

00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,679
right mind frame but when I came back

00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,840
from Pike on the next morning my my

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,610
family was gathered in my living room

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,140
knowing that the Flyers had just been

00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:08,290
eliminated from the playoffs and I was

00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:10,570
about to embark on my yearly attempt at

00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:14,230
a month off I was in the right mindset

00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:16,120
for what they had to say and I entered

00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,940
rehab and it's probably the best

00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:21,150
decision I ever made other than maybe

00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:23,380
asking my wife to marry me

00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:26,220
so some uncomfortable facts to consider

00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:28,480
continue 23 million Americans

00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,370
self-identify as being in recovery from

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,940
drug or alcohol addiction

00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:38,830
23 million that's a lot of this country

00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:41,679
and worldwide do the math I got away

00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:43,720
from everything for a month and started

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,700
to build my recovery experience to live

00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,280
the experience toebox of how to handle

00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:50,050
situations I was worried about leaving

00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,720
my colleagues of the river without a

00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:55,780
paddle in the lurch you know what's

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,260
funny believe it or not the world kept

00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:00,180
spinning without me at work

00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,070
it was absolutely incredible I wouldn't

00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:04,080
have believed it but they're really no

00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:06,450
excuses to get the help you need it will

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,420
make your life so much better

00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:12,150
it was Lou Gehrig who said today I

00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:14,730
consider myself the happiest man the the

00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,920
luckiest man in the world today I really

00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:19,980
do consider myself the luckiest person

00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,930
in the world so really if you have a

00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,420
problem please reach out to me or

00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:27,050
somebody else you will be kept it will

00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:29,610
be kept confidential we can talk

00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:33,330
so some uncomfortable facts in django

00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:35,280
con terms there are about 450 attendees

00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:38,930
here at django con we sold out great

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,430
work Jeff and the whole team

00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:44,910
approximately 45 of those people are

00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:48,480
addicted to alcohol or drugs and are

00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:50,910
actively using approximately five will

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,320
receive treatment and I am one of those

00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:58,590
five let's examine our culture and

00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,910
community a little bit programming in

00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,860
start-up culture we've heard it many

00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:03,720
times here already how many companies

00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,370
have you seen with beer on tap a bar

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,540
microbrews in the fridge offered as a

00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:11,190
perk people in technology are already at

00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:13,580
high risk for alcoholism and addiction

00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:16,820
the obsessive compulsive behavior is

00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:19,440
celebrated and it's all around us

00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:23,220
digital design and tech in general has a

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,260
culture of promoting alcohol use most

00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,270
Earthlings are capable of having a few

00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:29,610
drinks and stopping and they absolutely

00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:32,340
have that right but for those of us who

00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:35,250
cannot stop where one drink is too many

00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:38,340
and there's never enough it's really a

00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,870
temptation we have to remove you know I

00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,730
used to see things like oh I'm not a

00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:46,890
problem drinker I'm a solutions drinker

00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:49,100
I don't drink to have a good time I

00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:51,840
drink the stuff of voices in my head

00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:54,480
turns out those voices are your friends

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,090
sometimes it's a conscience motivation

00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,800
empathy they get buried under the under

00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,800
the sea of addiction you're swimming in

00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:06,090
so our culture encourages heavy drinking

00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:08,820
is a way of socializing networking in

00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:10,650
business I've solved one of my companies

00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,630
in a bar

00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:14,100
there are a fair number of us who can't

00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:16,770
just stop which leads us on a

00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,810
destructive path when alcohol becomes a

00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:22,470
perk of the workplace we risk alienating

00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:23,930
people in the quest for cool this is

00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:26,880
unacceptable

00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:29,490
the stigma of this disease will often

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,950
present people who have a problem from

00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:35,400
expressing it it did for me for many

00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:38,340
years there are quite literally people

00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:41,610
who should be at this event who are not

00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:44,610
here because of this disease I want you

00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:46,530
to meet Nick Dave Nick was my rehab

00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:51,320
roomate at the Melbourne Institute rehab

00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:53,550
in April 2015 during detox now detox

00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:56,580
it's about the lowest point you could

00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:58,590
imagine in life filled with shame so it

00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:00,960
does create a bond between roommates who

00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:04,260
are going through detox together sort of

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,360
a in the bunker foxhole mentality again

00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:09,540
we weren't best friends but we had been

00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,640
doing well in early recovery seeing each

00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:13,800
other at alumni nights back at the rehab

00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,900
every Tuesday night we'd go back even

00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:19,620
very early on to show people that there

00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:22,530
is hope who are currently in there I saw

00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:24,120
Nick on Tuesday October 20th 2015 at

00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:25,530
Melbourne alumni night me seem to be

00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:29,190
doing really well we were about six

00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:31,740
months in at the time on Monday October

00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:33,660
26 a couple days before I gave this talk

00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:38,220
for the first time Nick relapsed

00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:41,910
overdosed and died at age 24 this is a

00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:47,880
deadly progressive disease and it needs

00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:50,930
to be addressed so what can we do get

00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:55,710
professional help if you have a problem

00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:57,780
recognize a stigma tell a friend to get

00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:00,090
professional help an intervention can

00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:03,300
save a life even if it doesn't work the

00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:07,100
first time don't be afraid to talk about

00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:10,740
it these topics have to be on the table

00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:13,860
care instead of mockery empathy not

00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:16,020
judgement don't celebrate this disease

00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:19,080
sentiments like work hard play hard are

00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:21,030
 what are we kindergarteners who

00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,410
you get to go for recess you worked hard

00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:27,020
today examine your work culture called

00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:29,240
Penh Wharton and my boss are absolutely

00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:31,880
amazing and supported me in every way to

00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:34,580
get the help I need without any shame

00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:38,270
I've had nothing but support can we say

00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:40,250
that about many other workplaces again

00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:42,320
I'm not here to tell any Earthlings who

00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:44,780
can drink responsibly to stop drinking I

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,210
believe in having fun and absolutely

00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:49,130
insist on enjoying life but if you're

00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,350
like me you'll know you have a problem

00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:55,010
and if you think you have a problem

00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:57,170
please please get help reach out to me I

00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:59,030
will talk to any of you about this that

00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:01,880
is part of my medicine is helping

00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:06,080
another alcoholic or addict get the help

00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:09,500
they need it helps keep me sober so the

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:13,070
miracle I have a daily reprieve from the

00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:14,960
urge to drink I reach out to other

00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:18,320
alcoholics and try to help them and in

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,970
doing so I help myself I've been sober

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,950
on my birthday's for the first time

00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:25,820
since before Nirvana's Nevermind was

00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:28,370
released I've had more on us laughter

00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:31,310
enjoy my life that I've had in 22 years

00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:33,230
of addiction I get to spend a ton of

00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:35,570
time with my nephew watching him grow up

00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:41,000
he's three and lives five blocks from me

00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:43,060
I actually enjoy being myself again it's

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
a miracle

00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:50,690
so I'm gonna close with this yesterday

00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:54,410
is history tomorrow is a mystery today

00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:57,710
is a gift that's why we call it the

00:24:54,410 --> 00:25:00,470
present be sure you do something nice

00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:03,560
for someone else today and by the way if

00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:05,720
they find out it doesn't count altruism

00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:08,150
is its own reward and it's the key to

00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:12,080
recovery it's helping another alcoholic

00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:15,320
or addict out everyday isn't perfect I

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,450
strive for progress not perfection I am

00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:20,300
really lucky that there is a solution to

00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:22,040
my disease and once again I get to hang

00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,960
out with a bunch of my close friends who

00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:26,390
are like I am and talk about my favorite

00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:29,390
topic and biggest problem of me almost

00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:32,870
every day if not twice a day and life is

00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:34,430
good so I really want to thank the

00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:36,260
general community for providing a

00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:37,470
platform where we can talk about the

00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,600
really important issue

00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:41,759
if there's an issue of any type you want

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,620
to bring up the Django community is a

00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:45,659
place that will embrace it and that is

00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:47,759
one of our greatest strengths put the

00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:49,799
technology aside come for the technology

00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:51,120
State for the community that's all of

00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:53,129
you that's everyone here and everyone

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,809
across the world it's one of the most

00:25:53,129 --> 00:25:57,059
amazing communities I've ever been a

00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:59,190
part of I give a talk on how we found

00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:01,110
Django and I talk about all the

00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,669
technical things and you know we went

00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:04,889
through analyzing you know what kind of

00:26:02,669 --> 00:26:07,500
plug-in ecosystem does it have that out

00:26:04,889 --> 00:26:10,080
of the ORM work and at the end of it I

00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,509
talked about how damn lucky we got by

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,190
landing on such an amazing tech

00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:16,259
community the Django community and the

00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:18,480
Python community have been absolutely

00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:20,279
amazing and embracing Wharton as we've

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,279
moved to Python and Django as our

00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:24,539
framework and language of choice and you

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,429
know everybody who supported me the

00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:28,350
Django community my wonderful colleagues

00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:31,080
my friends and my family the warmth has

00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:33,899
been great the lack of judgment has been

00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,820
amazing the understanding of the fact

00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:39,000
that I have to put significant time into

00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:43,379
recovery has been amazing but uh most

00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,539
importantly I can now say hi I'm Tim and

00:26:43,379 --> 00:26:47,659
I'm an alcoholic and thanks for letting

00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,659
me share

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:28,640
thanks so much heartwarming if anybody

00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,330
has any comments or anything they'd like

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,220
to share

00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:37,190
we've got a couple of minutes before

00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:38,840
lunch and thanks so much I think I'll

00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:40,370
just say for everyone thank you so much

00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,630
for sharing and thank you so much for

00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:46,880
telling us your story

00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:48,710
thanks for us hey Tim hey Alex do you

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,600
think communities where they serve

00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:52,940
alcohol and that's kind of a normalized

00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,460
thing ah run inclusive to people who are

00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:57,650
recovering from alcoholism it's like I

00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:59,330
mean I'm a vegan and sometimes it

00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,680
bothers me when people around me are

00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:02,600
eating meat it makes me feel a little

00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,920
bit uncomfortable I'm wondering if fests

00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,590
are the same thing like if you feel

00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:08,840
uncomfortable when people around you're

00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:11,120
drinking it does when it's really the

00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,830
focus of event of an event but for me

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,440
it's very different than maybe any other

00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:17,870
alcoholic or addict so some alcoholics

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:21,310
and addicts have different triggers I'm

00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:23,990
not okay when the focus of an event is

00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:25,670
the bar the alcohol and I was partially

00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:27,200
responsible for leading those kinds of

00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:29,750
events before unless I sound like a

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,660
total hypocrite when I was in my act of

00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:34,310
addiction but things like the Monday

00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,840
night bowling night where it is not the

00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,740
focus and people are having drinks I'm

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,560
okay with that

00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,940
not every alcoholic and addict will be

00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,920
but I think the key here is to find a

00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,690
balance because I don't know of any

00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,610
alcoholics or addicts who you know want

00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:48,350
everybody to stop drinking because we

00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:51,200
have a problem again we're a small part

00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:53,210
of the population but we do exist and as

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,160
a vegetarian I can relate but I was I

00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:57,410
was very glad to see Django Caan once

00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,930
again showing how amazing it is a tagged

00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:01,550
vegetarian vegan table yesterday Thank

00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:03,110
You Ryan Sullivan and Alex are putting

00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:05,090
that together it's just another example

00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:06,290
of how amazing and inclusive this

00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:08,990
community really is

00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:13,220
I completely agree thank you Tim thanks

00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:15,320
Alice thank you Tim for a really amazing

00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:18,050
and honest talk I know that some of us

00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,520
here work at companies that do have the

00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:21,650
beer on tap and you have sort of a heavy

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,110
drinking culture do you have any tips

00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:26,450
about how we can approach the people in

00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:27,789
power in our workplaces to maybe at

00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:31,749
least you know remove the

00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:32,830
reader yeah it's sometimes it's hard

00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:35,109
because it's so entrenched in the

00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:37,720
culture my last company for example was

00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:38,049
a very blue-collar rough-and-tumble you

00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,359
know

00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:42,700
man-up type of community so it's a very

00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:45,549
difficult thing to broach depending on

00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:47,859
the context but I think more and more is

00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:49,479
at this topic gets talked about it gets

00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:50,919
easier and easier especially with things

00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:53,470
like YouTube where you can find all

00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:54,879
kinds of resources or you know the

00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,470
statistics I quoted here when you

00:29:54,879 --> 00:29:57,850
actually put them out there I think

00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:59,529
there are a lot of people who just don't

00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:00,999
realize how large a problem this is

00:29:59,529 --> 00:30:03,489
however it's getting a lot of attention

00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:05,019
and you know with the problems we're

00:30:03,489 --> 00:30:08,889
having with opiate addiction in this

00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:11,679
country now especially with companies

00:30:08,889 --> 00:30:13,809
that have promoted opiates is non

00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,479
addicting oxycontin in particular has

00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:18,159
gotten a lot of attention and well

00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:20,139
that's a very sad story when you hear

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,090
stories about senior citizens who are

00:30:20,139 --> 00:30:26,019
copping heroin because they can't afford

00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:28,269
their opiates anymore and the way the

00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:30,309
effect opiates have had on the suburbs

00:30:28,269 --> 00:30:31,960
it's not something that they can sweep

00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:33,580
under the rug anymore so I think it's

00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,989
getting noticed a lot more so there are

00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,580
a lot more resources out there and the

00:30:34,989 --> 00:30:39,340
conversation has started which is uh

00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:44,979
which has made you know made me proud to

00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:46,929
be in recovery thanks lacy all right I

00:30:44,979 --> 00:30:48,700
think it's lunchtime I'm gonna go listen

00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:50,289
to some very loud music in the data

00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:54,119
center for a few minutes but I'll be up

00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:54,119
there to see y'all soon thanks so much

00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,049
