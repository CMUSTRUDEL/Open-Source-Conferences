	DjangoCon US 2017 - The 10 Commandments of Community Organizing by Jennifer Wadella

Welcome to the advanced class on community organizing. You’ve got a decent amount of members in your Meetup.com group, you hold events fairly routinely, maybe you’ve pulled in some legit speakers at your last conference or event … and you want to do more. This talk will focus on community organizing for growth and longevity by building out teams, improving communications, implementing processes, and most importantly will discuss how to maintain sanity in your work-life-volunteer balance. If you’ve ever had to answer the question “Oh, this ISN’T your full time job???” - this talk is definitely for you. If you’re just starting out organizing and don’t want to fall flat on your face, this talk will be very pragmatic for you.

This talk was presented at: https://2017.djangocon.us/talks/the-10-commandments-of-community-organizing/

[Music]

00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:23,430
you guys hear me okay all right we hide

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,950
you ready for Jengo Conde - yeah all

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,560
right so hopefully you're in this room

00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,480
if you a would like to start organizing

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,579
events or be if you've ever got the

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,340
question oh this isn't your full-time

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,840
job as an event organizer a little bit

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,730
about myself I do work full-time as a

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,530
software engineer but I also run a

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,969
massive massive community and blow

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,120
people's minds the fact that I do both

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,289
at once so a lot of this talk content is

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,329
going to be about that how to do it

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,890
effectively and a lot of things I wish I

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,070
would have nor in four years ago when I

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,510
started so a little bit about me you can

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,670
follow me at like OMG it's Fetty on

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,079
twitter be warned I do watch The

00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,909
Bachelor Bachelorette and bachelor in

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,649
paradise and we watch live Monday nights

00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:05,190
and I do live tweet this is your one

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,960
warning like I said before our

00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,810
JavaScript developer community organizer

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,430
and diversity advocate obviously as a

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,200
woman in technology I've spent a lot of

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,940
time being isolated or being the only

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,950
woman which is why a lot of my community

00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,540
work is very focused on increasing

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,360
diversity efforts and helping bring

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,920
people up who may have a hard time I

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,540
want to kind of give you the overview

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,710
because if you're not from Kansas City

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,190
you've probably not heard about the work

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,750
I do so many years ago I decided to

00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,310
found a nonprofit called Kansas City

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,710
women in technology because I was sick

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,210
of being the only damn woman and I

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,130
launched this organization we had this

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,530
really big like kick-off event like 300

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,510
people attended and I don't know if I

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,460
ran into a single other female developer

00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,140
at this event there were women who

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,430
wanted to get into tech careers there

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,680
are educators wanting to know how to

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,760
bring their code to the classrooms and I

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,770
like to share this because it really

00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,020
kind of set the trajectory of our

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,430
organization so from there it became

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,170
very clear that we couldn't just you

00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,730
know like put out one call to action and

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,160
unite all the all the female engineers

00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,630
across the city so we put in place a lot

00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,280
of different programs based on community

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,500
requests and requests we got from the

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,660
feedback the first one of those is our

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,750
coderdojo chapter has anybody heard of

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,550
coderdojo before okay I got a couple so

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,129
coderdojo is a global nonprofit that was

00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:19,349
founded over in Ireland with the idea of

00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:22,230
creating a code for kids to learn how to

00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:23,519
code the really cool thing about it much

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,959
like Jenga girls is they kind of

00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:26,140
packaged it branded it and made it very

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,180
easy for other cities to

00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,350
a cup and lunch more than happy to talk

00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,910
to your ear off all day about coderdojo

00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,580
tell you how to launch one in New York

00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:35,200
City find me or tweet me but our chapter

00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,819
serves both boys and girls kids K

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,260
through 12 and our goal with this

00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:40,270
program is to create an idea of gender

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,709
blindness to get the concept that it's

00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,360
not weird to be a boy or a girl writing

00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:44,740
code just every day's rocking out

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,110
writing code having a good time

00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,300
um another key element here is we don't

00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:51,459
teach kids how to code we teach kids how

00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,810
to teach themselves how to code because

00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:54,760
what we want to do is create really

00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,800
viable skill sets for them to go and be

00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,870
the engineers of the future and create

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,580
new rules and blow past any boundaries

00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,690
and do things that are written in books

00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,420
simply because they haven't been done

00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:06,340
yet so from there we want to the program

00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,830
called coding and Cupcakes coding and

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,090
cupcakes came out of promoting coderdojo

00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,560
and I would get the programmer dads

00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,690
would be like oh my god this sounds

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,070
awesome signed my daughter up but I

00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,870
would get a very different reaction from

00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,090
a lot of mothers who would see coderdojo

00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,769
and say mmm I don't think my daughter

00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,170
would like that maybe I'll bring my son

00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:25,030
and so already we're fighting this kind

00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,160
of like disposition that parents have as

00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,989
against coding is an acceptable hobby or

00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,150
career path for girls so what do we do

00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:32,590
we brand it we make it pink we make it

00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,030
girly and all the sudden this program is

00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,489
sold out every month for the past three

00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,420
years we've been running it so yeah we

00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:39,190
want to get them in we want to get

00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,959
excited we want them to get exposure to

00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,180
coding in a positive light

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,950
Midwest def chat is a slack channel I

00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,170
run for developers all throughout the

00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:49,209
Midwest coding and cocktails is our

00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,620
adult series for women because again one

00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:52,600
of those things that came out of our

00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,890
community were women saying you're women

00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,070
in tech group why aren't you teaching me

00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,060
how to code there are a ton of great

00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,980
organizations around the country girl

00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,750
develop it that do this but this is our

00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,220
own branded version specifically Kansas

00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,100
City based on our needs in our community

00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:08,350
and then of course we run a jingle girls

00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,430
workshop every year I'm talking about a

00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,530
little more about that later in the

00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,390
presentation but if you haven't heard of

00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,980
jingle girls before I would encourage

00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,900
you to check it out again very easy

00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,489
implementable model to implement your

00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,709
own communities the curriculum is is

00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:22,150
stellar and have to have the problem

00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:24,070
around running a coding education

00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,600
program is writing curriculum it sucks

00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:29,650
jaqen Girls has done the work for you

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,510
okay so why 10 commandments this

00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,130
actually came out of a joke in that

00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:35,620
slack channel that I was talking about

00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,230
we do have a group for community

00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,150
organizers

00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,710
there and somebody was bitching about

00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,660
some problem that happened and I was

00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,490
like thou shalt confirm with the venue

00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:46,550
thrice and so it kind of became this

00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:48,410
running joke and just as is I've spent

00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,330
time running events and doing community

00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,100
organizing these kind of truths have

00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,270
started to pop up it happened that I

00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,410
wish I would have known about because I

00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,270
could have planned and executed better

00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,890
from the beginning so that's the basis

00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,440
of this talk so I'm gonna give you a

00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:02,240
quick overview oh so I was raised

00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,490
Catholic I'm not religious anymore but

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,950
the 10 commandments thing is a joke

00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,030
God you know certain rules down to Moses

00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,350
and he brought them down moving stones

00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,700
and the one stone had the three that

00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,790
were the most important commandments and

00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:15,470
then the other seven still important but

00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,390
not like as big as those big three and

00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,830
so this is very very much the same way

00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,900
these are your three big ones that

00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,460
absolutely take priority and then the

00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:26,210
other seven are definitely going to keep

00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,890
your sanity so real quick thou shalt

00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:30,410
practice self-care communit number one

00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:32,270
thou shalt become an expert communicator

00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:34,760
commitment number two that she'll manage

00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:36,710
expectations number three

00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,710
thou shalt not neglect the volunteers

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:42,320
thou shalt plan as far in advance as

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:44,930
calendar ly possible thou shall confirm

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,120
the venue thrice thou shalt arrive at

00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:49,700
least one hour before starting time thou

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,890
shalt test the Wi-Fi thou shalt have a

00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,690
designated chaos lead and thou shalt

00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:55,670
focus on process improvement wherever

00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:57,410
possible I would like to prioritize that

00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:59,900
that last one but that's a whole nother

00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:06,590
talk in and of itself so let's talk

00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:08,570
about self care as an organizer in the

00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,920
community it is so easy to get so

00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,300
excited and passionate because the world

00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,230
has so many problems we want to solve

00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,670
right but you can very very quickly bite

00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,260
off way more than you can chew and all

00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,610
of a sudden like starting off the

00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,600
calendar year its June you already

00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,710
burned out you're like crying yourself

00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,910
at sleep tonight because you're so

00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,320
stressed out with your million two deuce

00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:27,200
oh and they're still your day job which

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,250
is suffering madly so avoid burnout at

00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,890
all costs and we're gonna talk about

00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,750
ways to do this but I'm very big on self

00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,580
preservation because your community will

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:39,260
suffer if you do not prioritize your own

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:41,270
self-care take on small tasks tasks and

00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,370
improvements this is really big because

00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:45,260
again you see all these different

00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,340
problems you want to solve but if you

00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,510
want to be effective if you want to

00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,520
avoid burnout you want to break those

00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,969
down into very small pieces for instance

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,379
look at

00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:52,759
feedback from all the programs who run

00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:54,860
and will take that feedback and will say

00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:56,419
okay here's a big picture item like

00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,889
let's say motivating the kids to take

00:06:56,419 --> 00:06:59,509
some new challenge how do we break that

00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:01,189
down into smaller pieces where it's not

00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:02,929
this huge implementation standpoint all

00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:04,339
at once so we'll start planning we'll

00:07:02,929 --> 00:07:06,139
start documenting the startup process

00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:08,299
and then piece by piece and implementing

00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:09,769
that idea that we've come up with so

00:07:08,299 --> 00:07:11,839
breaking down tasks and small

00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:13,819
improvements and thinking what can i

00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,349
physically get done as a volunteer

00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:17,919
somebody who does not do this full-time

00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:21,289
and not hate my life

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,610
give yourself office hours this is huge

00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:24,259
when it comes to responding to email

00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:27,110
because that's what gets me every time

00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:28,219
is email hit my inbox and I think I have

00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,319
to insert right away but then that

00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:31,669
totally breaks my flow of whatever like

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,049
project I was working on at work with

00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:35,179
like this massive refactoring I was

00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:37,129
redoing so what I do is I give myself

00:07:35,179 --> 00:07:39,860
office hours where to say okay I'm gonna

00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:41,599
check and respond to email you know 6:00

00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,189
a.m. go to the gym 7:00 a.m. get back at

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,419
8:00 a.m. answer emails for another hour

00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:46,219
and then I start my work day and I do

00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:47,509
that 9:00 to 5:00 take a break for

00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:49,249
dinner and then I go back to my email

00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:51,529
answering for all those emails in

00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:53,479
between I love love love inbox by Gmail

00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:55,819
because it has a snooze feature which

00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:58,099
you can custom set your emails to alert

00:07:55,819 --> 00:08:00,229
you again it will save your life and you

00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:01,219
will look like such less of an

00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,899
when it comes to your email and

00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:04,669
communications nothing makes me feel

00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:07,129
worse than when I get that email from

00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:08,629
somebody being like hi you know I don't

00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:10,009
mean to bother you you didn't respond to

00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:12,050
my last email and I'm like oh my god I'm

00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:14,119
so sorry please nag me I am the worst I

00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:18,159
do care about you let me respond to that

00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:21,709
so inbox news feature highly recommend

00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:23,959
guard your time carefully your time is

00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:26,179
the biggest asset you have to offer and

00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:28,339
sometimes that's gonna mean saying no

00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:30,319
sometimes that's gonna mean prioritizing

00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:31,669
something over something else if you're

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,409
used to working on a product with

00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:35,360
features and you know the sales team

00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:36,800
comes to you they're like well I want a

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,399
B and C and it has to be done tomorrow

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,379
no no no no maybe I can give you a I can

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,089
get a start on B but manage other

00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:45,649
people's expectations and guard your

00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:52,389
time because that is the most precious

00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:52,389
asset you have no is a complete sentence

00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:57,199
speaking of guarding time Jennifer's

00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:58,880
first law a person's incompetence and

00:08:57,199 --> 00:09:00,259
email is directly proportionate to the

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,410
likelihood that they will massively

00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:06,779
waste your time

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:09,060
uh again this is four years of

00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:10,620
experience speaking that when somebody

00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,870
emails me about something and it's just

00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,920
like word vomit and I'll email back and

00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,079
I'm like I'm sorry can you please

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,129
understand a what what the time of date

00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:18,959
for this thing that you want me to show

00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:21,029
up at be what your target demographic

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,009
audience is so I can know the way I'm

00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:25,139
presenting or what kind of thing and you

00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:26,610
know see some other question if they

00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:28,920
can't answer three simple direct

00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:31,500
questions and continue to bomb it at me

00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,600
for another three email threads I know

00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,220
this person if they can't communicate

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,079
effectively in the email are going to

00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,670
waste my time I made this mistake

00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:40,470
I lost two hours of my workday

00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:43,230
volunteering to do this panel that this

00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:46,230
woman was endlessly berating me about it

00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:48,629
was a poorly run event by time it was my

00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,339
turn to speak I had literally 30 seconds

00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:52,019
with four other people behind me and we

00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,399
were at the end mark of time where none

00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:55,019
of us we're gonna communicate what we

00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,339
were there to communicate because this

00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:57,600
event was so poorly managed so

00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:00,389
mishandled and there were only four

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,350
people in the audience again one of

00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:03,689
those four people might have been

00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,189
valuable but me is my me and my time are

00:10:03,689 --> 00:10:06,750
very valuable and I need to guard and

00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:08,490
protect because I am going to be more

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,620
effective as a community organizer in a

00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,269
lead if I'm prioritizing where I'm

00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,750
spending my focus instead of edging

00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:19,380
towards burnout define your personal

00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:21,899
scope and don't go outside it as a

00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,000
diversity community since day one of

00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:25,680
launching we received so many requests

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,850
from the community and it's really

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,660
really hard because you want to do

00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,709
everything and you want to solve

00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,509
everything and you want to be everything

00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:32,610
for everyone but that's not feasible

00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:34,500
that is not something you as a single

00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,699
human being can do so this is where you

00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,319
need to define your personal scope

00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:39,300
you're gonna say okay I'm gonna take on

00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:41,339
X amount of ski speaking engagements per

00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,189
quarter you know I'll bet those whether

00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:45,329
it's a forum based on validity or you

00:10:44,189 --> 00:10:47,069
know who needs it more whatever your

00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:48,930
personal preference is but understand

00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:51,449
that you can set a personal scope and

00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:55,649
then don't step a foot outside it that's

00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:57,809
how burnout happens find a task tracking

00:10:55,649 --> 00:11:00,269
system that works for you

00:10:57,809 --> 00:11:01,199
Trello is a big one very easy to use and

00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:03,930
we're actually talking about this at

00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:06,149
breakfast I get really bad anxiety

00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,529
sometimes when I have so much on my to

00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:09,420
do plate that I have found the most

00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:10,740
effective solution for me and yes this

00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,300
does great against me because I'm a

00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,020
software engineer right but I write it

00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,300
down on a piece of

00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,740
paper and I don't know what that step is

00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,660
but all of a sudden I feel so much

00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,220
clearer and so much more coherent that I

00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,660
have this list on my desk this is what

00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,400
I'm gonna get done Monday this is what

00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,620
I'm gonna get done Tuesday I have to get

00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,080
this done by Thursday and so that's been

00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,940
really helpful for me again utilizing

00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,920
technical tools setting calendar to do's

00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,270
are crucial there are a lot of steps

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,180
that I'm going to talk about a few

00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:37,770
slides from now in are kind of the way

00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,850
we run our program so we've set calendar

00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,380
reminders to make sure we're always

00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:45,750
following up on these certain details

00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:47,670
that we need on your calendar how many

00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,110
times have you like wanted to set up a

00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,700
meeting with somebody and there's like

00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,870
four back and forth emails so well this

00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,220
time work for you well this time work

00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:57,570
for you well that day oh no actually I'm

00:11:53,220 --> 00:12:01,050
gonna be a vacation anybody yeah okay i

00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:03,000
gift you calendly so calendly is a

00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,470
service where you can basically set up

00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,030
your own personal calendar syncs with

00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:08,160
your Google Calendar and so you can

00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:09,510
block off time slots like for instance I

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,920
have my nine-to-five workday right I

00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,990
don't take meetings during that time

00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,970
except twice a week I'll have a 45

00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,860
minute mentoring window open if somebody

00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:18,210
is trying to get mentoring and launching

00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,980
organizations like mine that's my one

00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:21,420
exception but then from there I have my

00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,160
morning meetings and my evening meetings

00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,380
so when we're interviewing new team

00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,000
members for our organization I'll send

00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,380
them my account of calendly I can say

00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,340
hey excited to talk to you schedule

00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,320
something that works for you and my

00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:32,850
calendar done so there's no

00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,380
back-and-forth that way so much less of

00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:36,300
my time this is one of the best tools

00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,640
I've ever used it does have a free tier

00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:41,880
I use the pay blend because it gives me

00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,170
multiple different time slot options and

00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,000
it also has hidden options so my

00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,410
leadership team has access to like my

00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,420
hidden calendar availability but the

00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:53,610
general public only has this other view

00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:56,610
so this tool has saved my life fielding

00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:59,580
criticism I don't say this to scare you

00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:02,190
but if you do anything whether it's

00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,240
running an event getting you know in

00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,450
front of the community is a leader

00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,970
speaking you will get criticized you

00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:10,680
will get criticized a lot some of it

00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:13,020
will be valid some of it will not be

00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,940
some of it will people will have no

00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,410
understanding of the limitations that

00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:19,380
you're up against but that will not stop

00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,550
it so I like to kind of reef because I

00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,050
was not prepared for the amount of

00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,970
criticism I received when I started

00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,850
running an organization especially if

00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,880
it's an organization

00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:29,319
in supporting minorities that bullet on

00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,209
your back that target on your back for

00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:36,730
criticism is gonna get that much bigger

00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:38,410
because what about white men sorry so

00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:41,199
the key here is learning to decipher the

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:42,699
criticism it's incredibly hard when

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,529
somebody criticizes your event your

00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:46,000
organization something new is create you

00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:48,220
have created it's really hard to not

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,990
take that as a criticism of yourself

00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,670
because you created it it was your

00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,410
decision it was your thought process it

00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:55,420
was you know these things that are tied

00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:58,240
to yourself that made it run that way

00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:00,430
and this is incredibly difficult to you

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,350
know not devastate you and make you want

00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:05,670
to quit because you didn't do something

00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:08,199
perfectly perfect is the enemy of good

00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:09,579
so the trick is learning to decipher I

00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:11,319
love this quote by Hillary Clinton take

00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:13,930
criticism seriously but not personally

00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:15,699
if there's truth or merit in the

00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:18,279
criticism try to learn for it otherwise

00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:21,730
let it roll right off you a story time

00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:24,190
we had a leader on our team who came on

00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:26,170
she was very excited very energetic who

00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,220
really wanted to do the role and this is

00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,560
what she told me repeatedly

00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,880
however she consistently didn't do her

00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,680
role didn't fulfill her tasks and

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,980
responsibilities and would consistently

00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,779
no call no show our board meetings we're

00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:39,160
a very flexible organization a lot of

00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:40,630
the women involved with our organization

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,310
have families and sometimes they can't

00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:44,740
get kid duties handled or anything like

00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:47,170
that and so I'm very big on what I call

00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,430
work life volunteer balance all we need

00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,420
is clear communication let us know

00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,680
what's going on and we're gonna figure

00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,199
out a way to help each other out and

00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,730
work as a team however this person was

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,889
repeatedly not communicating with just

00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:59,079
no call no show this person would then

00:14:56,889 --> 00:15:00,759
post very passive-aggressive messages on

00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:02,410
our slack community pertaining to

00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:04,420
information that she a missed at that

00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:05,470
meeting and B did not read in the

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,339
meeting minutes that were sent to

00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:11,589
everybody else to follow up so this this

00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:15,839
was kind of happening and I this is back

00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:19,810
when I gave people more chances and

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:21,310
lesson learned so I was interested in

00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,630
asking her to step down but one of my

00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,800
team members was like oh she's going

00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,410
through a job turns such and give her a

00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,519
chance well this person then rage quit

00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:30,009
in the middle of our board meeting by

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,329
sending the nastiest email about me to

00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:34,959
our entire leadership team that I have

00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:37,029
ever received four paragraphs of why I

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,810
was a horrible human being why I was

00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:41,110
anti FEMEN

00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:43,120
like all this stuff 90% of it was just

00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,649
horrible and her trying to point fingers

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,209
because she realized that people were

00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:49,540
realizing she wasn't doing her role

00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:51,129
however each block of criticism that she

00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,319
had against me I knew started from

00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:55,420
somewhere so it was my job to say okay a

00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:56,860
lot of this is unwarranted this is her

00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,389
venting this is her trying to point

00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,160
fingers and throw shade at me

00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:02,110
that being said what was the trigger

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,329
point for this comment what could I have

00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:06,339
done in my behavior or in the way I was

00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:10,089
communicating to trigger to get to that

00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:11,170
escalation and so that's the real spot

00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:12,670
you need to be at criticism is

00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:15,759
understanding when people are just being

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:17,379
crazy but understanding your your part

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,999
in the role and figuring out how you can

00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:20,139
communicate better I'm not saying that

00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:21,730
you were the one in the wrong I'm not

00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:24,459
saying that they're not completely wrong

00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,870
but it will save you headaches down the

00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:27,579
line and you will feel better about

00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:30,600
yourself and the decisions you make when

00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:33,399
you kind of get this this clarity

00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,949
embrace the Mockingjay I'm assuming

00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:38,100
everyone who's seen Hunger Games yeah

00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:40,870
okay I very strongly identify with

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,529
Katniss because she just set out to do

00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,689
like this

00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:45,129
this one good thing right I just wanted

00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:47,350
to launch an organization for women

00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:49,000
developers but the thing that happened

00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,350
that I was not prepared to handle it was

00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,240
becoming this lightning rod becoming

00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:54,550
this symbol all of a sudden I was the

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,379
token woman in tech in Kansas City and

00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:58,360
it was a lot of spotlight that I was not

00:16:56,379 --> 00:17:00,459
prepared for I remember our first

00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,350
kickoff event I had to get off on stage

00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:03,790
and I'm literally just like slamming

00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:06,000
shots of bourbon because my hands are

00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:08,169
shaking and I'm terrified and I'm so

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,909
scared of having that spotlight on me

00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:11,409
and people looking at me and I was not

00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:13,419
prepared for this and I struggled

00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:15,010
against it for a very long time but I

00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:17,439
realized as a community leader as an

00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:19,209
advocate people want something to look

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,589
up to they want something to aim towards

00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:23,380
and so instead of letting my

00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:25,089
insecurities take over I had to learn a

00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:27,010
way to kind of embrace the Mockingjay

00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:28,569
embrace being that symbol and learn to

00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:32,890
operate in that world in a context of

00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:35,500
what people needed me to be build your

00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:37,149
network community organizing any

00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:41,409
leadership roles can be lonely because

00:17:37,149 --> 00:17:42,669
you have a certain level of stature and

00:17:41,409 --> 00:17:43,840
way you need to present yourself and

00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:45,070
sometimes that means you're not gonna be

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,480
able to talk to your team about certain

00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,799
issues you're gonna have rogue

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,649
volunteers you're gonna have awkward

00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:51,600
difficult conversation

00:17:49,649 --> 00:17:53,429
codes of conduct the way we're being

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,429
inclusive or exclusive these are

00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:57,929
conversations that warrant groupthink so

00:17:56,429 --> 00:17:59,779
the more you can find other community

00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:02,580
leaders to talk through your problems

00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:04,110
find a mentor mentor other budding

00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,309
community leaders because you don't want

00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,570
to do this for the rest of your life and

00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:08,700
only be the only one we want that

00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:10,710
multiplier effect the more you can do

00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,970
this the better your network will be I

00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,980
really love connecting with other

00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,019
community leaders because I've been

00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,909
through crazy like some of the

00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:20,159
stories I had to tell blow people's

00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:21,509
minds but I want them to be prepared for

00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:23,249
that because we weren't prepared for

00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:26,610
that and at coderdojo we had two dads

00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:28,230
almost get into a literal fistfight you

00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:30,090
don't there's no class on community

00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:32,730
organizing and how to deescalate to dads

00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:34,200
right so the more we can share stories

00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:36,119
and support each other and how figure

00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,309
out how to be very proactive about

00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:41,940
situations that might happen the

00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:44,669
stronger our groups will be learn to

00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:47,399
delegate so when I started my

00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:49,409
organization four years ago I went with

00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:52,649
a committee of women and it was like

00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:53,999
hurting angry cats everybody had

00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:55,679
a different idea everybody was going a

00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:57,360
different direction and there was a lack

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,980
of unity there was a lack of vision and

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,799
because it was a committee nobody had

00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,999
specific roles and so a couple of the

00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:04,980
girls had marketing backgrounds and I'd

00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:06,690
say okay hey take this meeting time

00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,919
let's put up a social calendar that's

00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,869
gonna outline our events for the next

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,070
six months well they'd be there for two

00:19:09,869 --> 00:19:15,360
hours they'd come back to me and tell me

00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:16,980
well we need to change the logo so I

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,450
made a lot of mistakes along the way the

00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,490
point that we operate now as an

00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:22,470
organization is I write actual job

00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,940
descriptions yes we are a volunteer

00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:25,559
organization but if you come on to our

00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,179
team you have a job description you have

00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:29,610
responsibilities you have quarterly

00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:31,860
goals and objectives again keeping in

00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:33,450
mind this offers work-life volunteer

00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:35,389
balance and we make sure that all our

00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:37,649
workloads and our responsibilities are

00:19:35,389 --> 00:19:39,179
manageable from that time and if it gets

00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:41,100
to be too much well that's when we start

00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:43,139
recruiting more people to help but this

00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,690
is huge and delegating because some

00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:47,940
people you can't just like lob a general

00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:49,139
task list out and say do this sometimes

00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,519
you as a leader need to take it on

00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:52,889
yourself to better prioritize and

00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:54,149
delegate I love this photo this is from

00:19:52,889 --> 00:19:56,129
our jingle girl's event this year this

00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:57,899
is our second year um the first year I

00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:59,539
did almost everything myself

00:19:57,899 --> 00:20:01,129
everything from

00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:02,989
marketing to communicating and

00:20:01,129 --> 00:20:04,820
recruiting mentors to all the attending

00:20:02,989 --> 00:20:06,590
communications to dealing with the

00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,179
vendors to get our food and dietary

00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:11,330
restrictions cover and it was a lot of

00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:13,729
work but this year I started early and

00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:14,869
recruited this amazing team and the fun

00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:16,669
thing about this was they took what I

00:20:14,869 --> 00:20:18,169
did the year before and they doubled it

00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:20,029
they did so much better than I as a

00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:21,619
single person could ever do alone

00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:22,970
they brought way more mentors in they

00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:24,889
got way more attendees and they were on

00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:26,840
the news talking about this you might

00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:28,429
have worked this team put in blew my

00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,539
damn mind and it's the best feeling in

00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:32,179
the world that you can have as an

00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:34,159
organizer to do something and then have

00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:35,869
a team come together and do it way way

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,029
better that's the multiplier effect

00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:39,349
that's how we grow and build sustainable

00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:40,249
communities is by bringing other people

00:20:39,349 --> 00:20:42,080
into the fold

00:20:40,249 --> 00:20:44,059
- then superseded with everything we've

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,710
done before so learning to delegate is

00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:49,849
huge if you're a type-a neurotic

00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:51,950
control-freak like me it's gonna take

00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:54,679
some some mousse on some stress relief

00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:56,960
but documentation is Cle keek reading

00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:59,389
clear and defined roles and making it

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,799
easy for people to step into this that

00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:02,960
being said a mistake I've been in the

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,759
past is I am a mama lion I like to

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,279
protect my people I probably called a

00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:09,109
Caudill way more than I should and so

00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,700
sometimes they hurt me that I've not

00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:12,080
I've tried to like solve all the

00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:15,229
problems for everybody instead of giving

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,059
my leadership team key opportunities to

00:21:15,229 --> 00:21:19,039
solve their own problems and then become

00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:20,599
you know efficient in that area so

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,039
that's something to keep in mind is if

00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:23,479
you're like me you might want to protect

00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:24,679
everybody and make it easy and like make

00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:26,989
sure everybody's lives are manageable

00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:28,340
but make sure you are not blocking their

00:21:26,989 --> 00:21:32,210
opportunities for growth and for

00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:34,970
leadership alright that was a big

00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:38,929
commandment thou shalt become an expert

00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:42,470
communicator communication I pretty sure

00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:44,090
is the problem behind every issue poor

00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:47,809
communication so this is something I

00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:49,309
really really harp on never assume

00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:53,450
people are as in tune to your

00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:55,399
organization as you are so I like to

00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,659
bring this up because when you're

00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:58,429
working full time and when you're

00:21:56,659 --> 00:22:00,259
running something on the side it's so

00:21:58,429 --> 00:22:01,369
easy to get tunnel vision right because

00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:04,909
you're trying to implement you're trying

00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:06,830
to execute and it's easy to assume that

00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:08,029
everybody is on that same page everybody

00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,889
is operating on the same level of

00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:11,890
priority about your focus that you are

00:22:09,889 --> 00:22:12,910
and that's not how the world works

00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:15,010
people are dealing with their own

00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:16,420
and so that's why communication is key

00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,860
to make sure that what you have

00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,210
prioritize is getting communicated to

00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:23,080
other people who might not have it as

00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:24,700
high on their list I have a lot of

00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,830
communication patterns just like you

00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:29,290
know design patterns and code that I use

00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:30,910
all the time for effectiveness I like to

00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:32,950
make things easy for people with lists

00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:34,840
and call out important information like

00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,540
I mentioned those word plummet emails

00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:39,250
earlier no do not worry DOM attack me it

00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:41,470
is so if it takes me two or three times

00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:43,240
to read your email to gain valid

00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:45,400
information from that you just wasted my

00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,140
time and reduce my willingness to work

00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,490
with you and so I hold myself at that

00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:51,640
same standard if I want to communicate

00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:54,400
to a group of people I am going to write

00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,260
craft reread and tweak this email until

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,000
I know that they can glean all the

00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:59,530
information that they need necessary and

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,960
it's not going to be a pain in the butt

00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:03,730
for them to digest one of the things I

00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,320
do that I like to call out is when I

00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:07,720
mention a date I do this certain date

00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,760
formatting I say the date of the week so

00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:13,210
like let's say Friday the actual date of

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:15,490
the week let's say August 18th and the

00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:17,380
time and the time zone this is a little

00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:18,700
trick from my mentor who would tell me

00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,870
about trying to get people to follow up

00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,700
on things and if you didn't include this

00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:23,590
time zone it was very easy for people to

00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,900
be like oh well I thought you meant like

00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:27,760
6 o'clock in the evening not 6 o'clock

00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,920
in the morning so these are kind of

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,360
safeguards you can put in to let people

00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,980
know exactly what time line you're

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,390
communicating on especially if your

00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,860
event planning and have to have certain

00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,180
things in place giving that sort of

00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,830
deadline that will easily stick in

00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,810
people's brains is great like if you

00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:42,010
were to just say you know August 18th

00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,600
would you know off the top of your head

00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:45,310
what day of the week that was unless you

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,890
had something else going on on Friday

00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:50,170
August 18th so this is just the tiniest

00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:52,180
little trick that can help you get other

00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:57,550
people in your same level of remembering

00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:59,440
when things are happening so this is

00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:01,990
probably hard to read but this is an

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,130
example of the email I sent out at the

00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,730
beginning of the month my leadership

00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:06,700
team

00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:07,960
I've got about 23 people right now and

00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:12,970
they're all across our different

00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:14,560
programs that we run and so I kind of

00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,910
like to lay out again people get tunnel

00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,380
vision and what they're focusing on so

00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,670
here's where I call out everything we're

00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,850
gonna have going on with the month with

00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:23,140
that date format overall updates any big

00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:24,280
sponsorship updates like if our

00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,620
marketing chair needs to know to put a

00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,300
news

00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,790
in the newsletter and any leadership

00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,110
members we might be interviewing I also

00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:32,000
always include an opportunity for

00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:34,670
one-on-one meetings of my calendar again

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,370
with our leader that you know went

00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:38,480
nuclear in some time email I think I

00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,650
could have been better about pulling up

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,240
with her and saying hey if you have any

00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:42,860
concerns please let me know hey if you

00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,510
have any criticism or feedback beat for

00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,220
me please let me know and instead of

00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:48,940
letting it just escalate to this point

00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:52,460
where she went a little apeshit okay um

00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:54,880
natural manager expectations people are

00:24:52,460 --> 00:25:00,980
not psychic people are not psychic

00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:04,309
people are not psychic so this is a

00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:06,860
pitfall that hit me very early in my my

00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:09,140
organizing career because if you're like

00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:10,850
me time is important and if I'm gonna go

00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,110
to event I'm gonna read all the text on

00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:13,250
that Eventbrite page I'm gonna know

00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,570
where the venue is I'm gonna know

00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,920
exactly what's happening I'm gonna know

00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:17,780
exactly when the schedule is of things

00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,550
and so I just assumed that everybody

00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:23,179
operates on this baseline I do of

00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:24,620
reading what event they're going to this

00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:27,410
does not happen a lot especially with

00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:28,700
parents and so they'll come in not

00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:30,559
having read and me having the

00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,610
expectation that they have read saying

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,590
well I thought it was going to be this

00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:34,910
and that's where the contention happens

00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:36,650
that's where do people get pissy that's

00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:38,090
when they get upset that that things

00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:39,860
weren't the way they were expecting so

00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:41,210
the more you can do to communicate

00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:43,370
effectively whether it's on Eventbrite

00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:45,260
descriptions or sending out emails or

00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:47,240
whatever works for your organization to

00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,890
better manage people's expectations the

00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,309
less criticism and complaints

00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:54,140
are going to get oh you need my real job

00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:55,850
so I mentioned this in the beginning of

00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:57,020
the talk get this question a lot there's

00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:58,580
this weird thing that happens with

00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,500
volunteer organizations that people just

00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,790
assume that you're not restricted to

00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,559
traditional business restraints that

00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:05,870
economies of scale don't apply to you

00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:07,070
because it's volunteer it's the same

00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:08,120
thing of like when you get an app for

00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,679
free in the App Store and you like

00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,750
expect way more than an app you'd pay a

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,059
dollar for just because it's for free

00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:15,620
right they can do everything so this is

00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:17,000
something that's very easy to fall prey

00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:19,220
to because people don't understand

00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,350
sometimes you'll have to explain that I

00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,850
do kind of mention at least once a year

00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:24,650
at a lot of our events please be nice to

00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:26,390
our volunteers they give up their

00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,890
Saturday morning to help your kids code

00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,730
so please keep that in mind we're not

00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,970
paid to be here

00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:33,810
sometimes people need that reminder

00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:38,020
grace is gonna cry

00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:39,580
this is a gift from The Bachelor she is

00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,880
like possibly my favorite villain of all

00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:43,420
time

00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,830
I want to say that no matter how well

00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,720
are you doing me and Jake expectations

00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:50,290
and clearly communicating some people

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,490
will never be pleased I'm running a

00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,860
little low on time but I love to share

00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:58,270
the story just because it's hysterical

00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:59,830
so I got a tweet when my twitter account

00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:01,990
had to be private for a period of time

00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:04,060
with this dude reaching out about my my

00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:05,470
or Kansas City women technology he's

00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,460
like well I tried to email your website

00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:08,020
he's broken why don't you have a phone

00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:11,440
number in my head I'm like you're why we

00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:13,360
don't have a phone number listed but so

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,560
I respond to him but my account is

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,020
private so he couldn't see my tweet

00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,730
which I realized after the fact but we

00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,930
had a check talk which are one of our

00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:21,280
general networking events that Wednesday

00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:23,560
night and we were doing it at this

00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,630
arcade bar and so the event just started

00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,820
like I'm sitting facing the door and two

00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:29,200
girls had just walked in and they were

00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:31,630
sitting we were we were talking

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,760
it's crazy looking to like his hair

00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:35,350
puffed out to here like blocks eyes with

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,050
me and be lines and I'm like oh

00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:40,000
this can't be good and so he immediately

00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:41,590
begins laying into me about this the

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,510
fact that his daughter is interested in

00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:45,940
computer science and goes to school like

00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:47,140
45 minutes away and she doesn't have a

00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,340
mentor and her friends make fun of her

00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,110
for being interested in computer science

00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:52,090
and it's just reaming me about this and

00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:53,140
I'm you know Jessica Lee okay I'm sorry

00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:54,640
sir like we're still a small

00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,800
organization we haven't been able to

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,330
expand out to colleges yet you know

00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,560
absolutely want to do everything we can

00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,240
to support but we're still small and

00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,620
growing and trying to build up none of

00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,140
this was satisfying him he was just

00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:07,480
reaming my ass and so finally I'm like

00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:09,340
you know I'm more than happy to give you

00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,600
my email address for your daughter like

00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,830
I understand what it was like to be your

00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,210
daughter I was definitely made fun of

00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,890
for my computer interest and he's like

00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:17,410
well I can't do that she won't listen to

00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:18,940
me anyway and so I was like oh okay you

00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:20,530
literally just came here to me out

00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,180
there was no conflict resolution you

00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,630
were looking for you just wanted to yell

00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:29,650
at me

00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:31,180
Crazy's gonna cry so another issue I've

00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:32,680
run into is being a good community

00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,390
partner because when you're launching an

00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,790
organization other organizations in town

00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:38,980
might want to partner with you and I

00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:41,410
firmly believe that you need to secure

00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,710
your organization's oxygen mask first

00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:46,370
before partnering with other aurochs

00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:48,140
partnering with other organizations you

00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:49,460
need to get your house in order to be an

00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,890
effective community partner and it's

00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:53,570
okay to express that

00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:54,770
so get your house in order then you can

00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:57,080
build building begin building

00:28:54,770 --> 00:29:02,420
partnerships and helping others

00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:04,040
thou shalt not neglect the volunteers do

00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:05,300
not make your volunteers herd cats I

00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,650
don't know if you've ever showed up to

00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,030
an event before where it wasn't real

00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:09,290
structured or real planning you show up

00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,790
and you're excited and ready to help and

00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:12,260
there's just a million things going on

00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:14,450
you can't get instructions for what to

00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:16,030
do like nobody really has a place and

00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:18,440
you feel like maybe your time was wasted

00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:20,420
if you want your volunteers to come back

00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,340
have everything structured and ready and

00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:24,020
set up for them don't ask them to go do

00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:26,150
all this insane problem-solving and cat

00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,440
herding it's not fun especially if you

00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:28,640
don't know what's going on you don't

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,550
have contacts and you're not in control

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,170
it's just stressful mmm make things

00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:34,910
easier for your volunteers make parking

00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,559
and arrival instructions clear have an

00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:37,640
emergency contact number available have

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,410
clear instructions duties and

00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,330
responsibilities for your volunteer and

00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,140
as much as possible keep your volunteers

00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,870
out of the line of fire

00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:47,270
of criticism see earlier Crazy's gonna

00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:49,040
cray I don't like putting my people in

00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:51,860
the crossfire of people that I know will

00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,940
never ever be happy mm-hmm plan your

00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:55,280
events ahead of time get volunteers

00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:56,450
plenty of notice I really like sending

00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:59,090
out reminder emails and creating

00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:00,679
calendar invites the key here is to make

00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:02,059
sure that one person is in charge of

00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:03,740
communications and your volunteers

00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:04,580
aren't getting communicated with for

00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:08,059
multiple people that may have

00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:09,740
conflicting priorities again falls back

00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:11,090
to communication excellent communication

00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:14,150
is clear and keeping your community your

00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:16,520
volunteers your mentors happy find ways

00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:18,590
to thank your volunteers solicit their

00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,059
feedback and act on it we hold

00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:21,890
retrospectives after every single one of

00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:23,270
our events and we ask the mentors for

00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:24,830
their feedback because we want to keep

00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:26,900
them coming back so we want to take

00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:28,850
their input and implement what we can to

00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:31,280
make their experience better offer

00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:32,900
leadership opportunities and so as we've

00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,460
grown instead of trying to become a

00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:36,050
control freak and handle everything we

00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:38,300
very much try and build our vent our

00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:39,800
volunteers and our mentors up allow them

00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,750
to take on organization rules build the

00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,730
resumes get some leadership practice

00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,320
provide nice volunteer shirts

00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:46,820
I hate crappy shirts that don't fit and

00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,220
everybody else does too so please

00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:51,470
prioritize that play an appreciation

00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:53,420
dinner some parties afternoon a big

00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:54,230
event sometimes it could be mice nice to

00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,910
wind down

00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:57,929
you know nice dinner in a cocktail so

00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:59,700
this is something we always prioritize

00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:01,559
actually thank you to rub sis for

00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,909
sponsoring our mentor appreciation party

00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:05,909
this year after our jungle girls event

00:31:02,909 --> 00:31:09,600
it was quite lovely promote their

00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:11,369
efforts so developers especially women

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,169
aren't always the first to step up to

00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,789
brag about themselves so brag for them

00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:16,769
this is just the tiniest tiniest thing

00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:18,240
that you can do to show how much you

00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:19,649
appreciate your volunteers they're

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,240
working on an open-source project

00:31:19,649 --> 00:31:22,710
tweet a little bit about that offer to

00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,980
feature them in a blog if you have more

00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:28,379
of a platform to offer them nominate

00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:29,879
them for awards I'm so excited my

00:31:28,379 --> 00:31:31,110
organization is needed to do this for

00:31:29,879 --> 00:31:33,059
like almost four years but we finally

00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:35,519
recruited a stellar PR chair and one of

00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:37,019
our roles is simply to take all the

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,429
amazing women in our organization get

00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:40,169
information and submit them for awards

00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:42,240
again back to that me being the token

00:31:40,169 --> 00:31:43,830
woman in tech and Kansas City problem

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,269
we're very actively trying to dispel

00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:46,619
that by getting all these other women in

00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:47,850
the spotlight so if you can do that for

00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:48,960
your volunteers and your mentors your

00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:50,970
already know they're donating their time

00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,649
and are good people and doing great work

00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:55,740
so let's make sure they get recognized

00:31:52,649 --> 00:31:56,999
for that again this is going to take

00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,619
more time and more effort on your part

00:31:56,999 --> 00:32:01,169
but it will keep your volunteers coming

00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:02,759
back feeling happy and also recruiting

00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:05,970
other volunteers to come and enjoin your

00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:07,950
organization national plan is far in

00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:10,230
advance this calendar calendar Lee

00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:16,490
possible it was the worst word but it's

00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:16,490
effective sorry my slide sir

00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:29,089
[Music]

00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:41,120
okay sorry about that okay moving on so

00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:42,590
if you plan your events in advance it'll

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,260
be easier to book speakers volunteers

00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:46,670
and venues granted people have their own

00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,470
schedules so if you can get on their

00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:49,910
schedule earlier on that's key to do

00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:51,200
you've ever planned a wedding you have

00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:53,990
to book your venue at least a year in

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,820
advance so keep that in mind if you have

00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:57,830
diversity goals make efforts sooner

00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:00,350
rather than later nothing drives me up

00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:01,940
the wall more than some organization

00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:04,250
putting on some event and then emailing

00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,480
me less than 24 hours for this event

00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,890
because they've suddenly realized they

00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,120
don't have any women on their panel and

00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:10,400
they might get chewed out for lack of

00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,660
diversity I'm like sorry dude if you

00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,220
really want to make a diversity effort

00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:15,050
I'm not gonna be your token woman 24

00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:18,650
hours in advance like do a better effort

00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:23,140
from the get-go mm-hmm now she'll

00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:25,190
confirm the venue thrice cover your ass

00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:26,900
we've had events before we've had

00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:28,280
routine monthly events and then I've

00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,020
shown up like one month and knocked at

00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:32,180
the door nobody's there the space ism

00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:34,130
asked my attendees arriving who looks

00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:36,680
like the Jackass here it's me it's not

00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:38,660
the vendor so anything you can do to

00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,920
keep your vendors and your venues on the

00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:42,410
same page with you the better you will

00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:44,030
look again more work on your part but

00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:45,410
you will you will have better feedback

00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,730
and you will have solid events if you

00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:48,170
make sure that you're notifying

00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:49,850
everybody and reminding them because

00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:53,300
they have Mordor to focus on than just

00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:54,170
your event and here we go again with my

00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:57,260
okay

00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:58,640
follow up or look like a jackass this is

00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:00,500
something that I fell prey to early

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,550
where I would you know take get feedback

00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,310
and be like well they should have just

00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:08,300
known or I'm a volunteer so you know

00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:09,260
they should know I only have five

00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,790
minutes left okay

00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,260
thou shalt write at least one hour

00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,610
before starting time setup will always

00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,899
take longer than you expect your team

00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:17,090
and speakers will be late your attendees

00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:18,860
will show up early first year and Jenga

00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:21,980
girls are attendee showed up two hours

00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:23,149
early our volunteer staff wasn't even

00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:26,030
there yet we were still getting off work

00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:28,340
in setting up the venue so it happens be

00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:31,280
aware be prepared for it - I'll test the

00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:33,740
Wi-Fi and bring any supplies needed bad

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,659
Wi-Fi will tank your technical event in

00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:37,159
a heartbeat it's not fun there's no

00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:40,159
coming back from it

00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:42,440
that being said test test ahead of time

00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,790
if you can and really key have the phone

00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,560
number of their contact information for

00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,570
the person who adores where the router

00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,120
is be can unlock where the router is and

00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:52,250
three reset the router bring all the

00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,390
dongles I firmly believe that it's on

00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,470
speakers to bring their own equipment

00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:56,500
but again you're the one who's gonna

00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:59,470
look like a jackass so be prepared

00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:01,640
I shall have a designated chaos lead

00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:04,520
Murphy's Law what can go wrong will go

00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,660
wrong no matter how well you plan an

00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,710
event there is something that will

00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:12,290
happen that you will not have planned

00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:18,920
for I'm assuming everybody seen this

00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:20,390
gift before there will always be

00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,380
problems you can't plan for the one

00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,640
thing you don't want to have is your

00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,020
leadership team that's already in charge

00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,250
of running event being those people

00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:27,110
running around to solve problems on the

00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:28,880
fly so have a designated chaos lean

00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:30,800
somebody who is there simply to deal

00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,570
with all the random things oh the toilet

00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,980
paper ran out of the bathroom we've got

00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:35,780
a random person to go make a Costco run

00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:37,310
to handle that that did happen in New

00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:39,050
York City Gengo girls event by the way

00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:42,070
it's like terrified me ever since I

00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:43,790
heard that story constant vigilance

00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:45,560
again I don't want to scare you from

00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:46,940
community organizing I just wanna I like

00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,440
to send my troops into battle prepared

00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,910
right so I want I want you to know

00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,470
everything that can go wrong so you can

00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:53,810
hold effective events being aware of

00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:56,150
that thou shalt focus on process

00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:57,680
improvement wherever possible we do

00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,910
retrospectives after all our events we

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,440
solicit feedback from our 10:00 news

00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:01,820
from our mentors from our volunteers

00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,440
from the parents of our attendees and

00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:05,150
then we take this feedback we collect it

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,290
in Docs there are some big items that we

00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,730
can't tackle right away but there are

00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:09,740
some small things that we can tweak and

00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:11,090
add to our process improvement that's

00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:13,460
allowed us to run really great events

00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:14,810
over time over the past four years our

00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:16,340
retrospectives have gotten shorter and

00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:17,600
shorter and shorter and so and finally

00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,740
they got to the point where nobody had

00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,240
anything to say and I'm like alright

00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:24,140
what's our next big challenge innovate

00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:26,150
or die talk about what went well what

00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,860
didn't go well and what can we do better

00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:30,830
next time if you've never been to a

00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:32,060
retrospective before repeat emails if

00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:33,650
you get a lot of emails asking the same

00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:35,420
question those questions should be on

00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:37,250
your fax page they should be on bold in

00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:38,990
your fax page people will miss stuff on

00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:41,690
the pax page make it easy for them to

00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:44,000
read identify your pain points and work

00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:46,160
on those first again biting off what's

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,600
feasible but definitely identifying what

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,800
your leadership team was spending the

00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,830
most time on especially if it's

00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,260
monotonous and can be automated

00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:55,250
streamline your check-in process

00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,780
automate posts to social media wherever

00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:58,250
possible I'm

00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,660
for engineering sake at social media

00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,160
unless it's live tweeting the bachelor I

00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,510
have a very amazing team who does that

00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:05,570
instead and there's so much better at it

00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:07,430
than I would ever be begin gathering

00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:08,930
data and feedback as soon as you can I'm

00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:10,310
getting these processes of place are the

00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,930
best thing you can do you for continuing

00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:13,310
to improve and also going after

00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:14,660
sponsorship money you can say hey these

00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:16,010
were these were the numbers we hit

00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,330
that's last year this is what we're

00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:19,220
doing this year this is projected for

00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:22,990
the next year that can really be great

00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:25,820
in your tool belt summary those are

00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:26,960
community organizing if you follow me on

00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,460
Twitter I am working on a book that

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,440
summarizes a lot of this and a lot more

00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:32,690
so if you want to get more information

00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,100
that will be a good place to look these

00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:37,150
slides are available on github at that

00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,150
link does anyone have any questions

00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:45,470
thanks for the great talk and the tips

00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:48,020
regarding any box by Google and Kalyn D

00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:49,610
my question is I have an 11 year old

00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:51,590
niece who lives in Jacksonville Florida

00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:53,480
and she has a 13 year old brother who

00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:56,870
has really embraced writing Python code

00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:58,760
with the PI game library what resources

00:37:56,870 --> 00:38:00,440
would you recommend that my niece can

00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,570
access online

00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:05,090
perhaps a specific resource on coderdojo

00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:07,190
or a book I can order for her to give

00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:13,520
her a fair opportunity to get excited

00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:14,810
about code it's either 18 months or

00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,800
three years I can't remember is the coda

00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:17,630
pillar by fisher-price

00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,220
which is this little caterpillar you can

00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,990
connect to do cool programming that's

00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:29,270
good for her age as soon as she is

00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:30,360
capable of read alright that changes my

00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:33,990
answer then

00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,990
[Laughter]

00:38:34,339 --> 00:38:37,760
we start all our kiddos off on scratch

00:38:36,109 --> 00:38:40,460
which is the drag-and-drop UI developed

00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,809
by MIT that being said at a conference a

00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,579
couple weeks ago I just gave a talk on

00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:45,049
jewel box which is programmable jewelry

00:38:43,579 --> 00:38:47,869
founded by Sara Chipps who's the

00:38:45,049 --> 00:38:50,210
co-founder of girl develop it and so

00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:52,250
those are programmable bracelets I mean

00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:54,109
it's basically a nicely packaged Arduino

00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:56,450
but they can sync via bluetooth can

00:38:54,109 --> 00:38:58,280
connect with her friends have a really

00:38:56,450 --> 00:39:00,380
great community and utility library and

00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:02,180
Docs around it so I'm interested in

00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:07,819
getting something like this set up in my

00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:10,490
community but I'm wondering how as a

00:39:07,819 --> 00:39:12,230
male do I get women to feel comfortable

00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:14,329
to come to things like that and believe

00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:16,880
I'm gonna respect them and all that kind

00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:19,369
of stuff yeah I get this question a lot

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,900
we've actually got a women take tech

00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:27,200
makers group in town which my buddy Kyle

00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:28,670
runs because if you start there if

00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,299
you're a lightning-rod and create a

00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,530
group for women

00:39:29,299 --> 00:39:32,390
eventually women are gonna come that

00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:34,069
want to step in and join your leadership

00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:35,480
teams so the best you like if you can

00:39:34,069 --> 00:39:36,980
just start if you can just like plow

00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,630
through that wall get things going and

00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,460
then help support the women who want to

00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:44,630
come up and and lead it that's the best

00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:46,730
way to go so in terms of community

00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:48,920
organizing like the the processes that

00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:50,540
you're proposing here they definitely

00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,710
sound like really great and like you're

00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,849
gonna run really great events with them

00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:54,260
but they also sound like they take a lot

00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:57,200
of time like you were saying and I was

00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:58,849
wondering whether you find that like you

00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,099
were talking about work-life balance and

00:39:58,849 --> 00:40:03,380
are you able to sell the same like other

00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:04,819
hobbies or like how much of a life do

00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:07,339
you have if you're spending like three

00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:10,309
hours a day answering emails how does

00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:13,000
that work I totally halo like for four

00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:16,430
hours on a Friday night it was awesome

00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,410
no so this has been a lot of work from

00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:20,930
the get-go and this was so much time and

00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:23,660
this was so many like nights like crying

00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:24,980
on the phone like struggling but once I

00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:26,359
got to this point of getting all these

00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:28,250
processes in place and building up a

00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:30,230
leadership team I don't spend nearly

00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:32,000
that much time anymore like if I had

00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:34,250
better known how to set up leadership

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,819
and roles and better delegate from the

00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,619
get-go

00:40:34,819 --> 00:40:38,089
which is why I give this talk I would

00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:40,380
have had a lot more time in the

00:40:38,089 --> 00:40:45,059
beginning so as far as the time I said

00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:46,349
this a week I mean between composing

00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:48,569
emails and like managing my leadership

00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:49,710
team and dealing with random like issues

00:40:48,569 --> 00:40:51,660
that come up it's probably gotten down

00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:52,859
like maybe five hours a week like it's

00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,029
been low enough that I've been able to

00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:55,440
get back on the speaker circuit again

00:40:54,029 --> 00:40:57,390
and start doing talks around the country

00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,789
so just put in the hard work at first

00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:01,170
and then it'll level out I was just

00:40:59,789 --> 00:41:03,240
curious to hear a little bit more about

00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:05,430
I've run an organization as well and

00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,960
I've started to delegate in the problem

00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,220
I'm having is kind of you talked about

00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,599
that email you send at the beginning of

00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:11,759
every month to kind of like level set

00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,200
I'd be curious to talk just to hear a

00:41:11,759 --> 00:41:15,930
little bit more about your experience

00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:18,869
once you delegated how you kind of

00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:20,069
started to see communication be useful

00:41:18,869 --> 00:41:21,180
to those people to make sure stuff

00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:22,890
didn't fall through the cracks to make

00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,750
sure the communication came up to you

00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:27,089
and back down and just how to manage

00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:29,640
that yeah I asked my team to CC me on

00:41:27,089 --> 00:41:30,930
everything just so I kind of have like a

00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,250
bird's-eye view again I'm trying not to

00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:34,950
be such a mama lion and give them

00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:36,900
opportunities there but so having them

00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:38,430
see see you in communications we have

00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,839
several different program teams that are

00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:41,579
running on their own schedules that I

00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,930
don't even attend those meetings I just

00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:44,430
ask that they're on the calendar and

00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:46,470
then meeting the meeting notes from

00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:48,420
everything or added do Google Drive we

00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:50,039
do monthly board meetings where we do a

00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:52,200
recap of everything that's going on so

00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:53,640
people are aware I'm aware most of my

00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,740
team will approach me if there is an

00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,940
