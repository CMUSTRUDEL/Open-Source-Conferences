[Music]

00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:18,050
there we go right so it's about

00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,360
something I was thinking up on the plane

00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,440
ride from Python Australia to here which

00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,660
was last week

00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,700
I like content in text files it's great

00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,500
you can have things formatted nicely

00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,180
they can be in get you can do pull

00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,669
requests on them it's all fantastic but

00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:34,130
I also like things in CMS's in

00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:36,260
particular I'm a big fan of wagtail and

00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:39,110
so I'm redoing my personal site in

00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:41,120
wagtail and I'm well I mostly like it

00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,410
but there is content I want to have in

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,960
such static files I have things like

00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,370
lists of national parks and lists of my

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,410
talks that don't really change their

00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,840
append-only they're more suited to get

00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:53,269
and so I thought why not have both how

00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,800
can I combine these two into one site in

00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:57,739
a particular I didn't want to have to

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,420
rewrite a custom thing that paused gamal

00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:01,910
files for every page loading the video

00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,199
was really slow I wanted to use the ORM

00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,420
in Django because it's great because

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,400
it's Django and so I have made a thing

00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,750
called haven't pronounced this year on

00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:13,520
stage let's go with Yambol which is an

00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,780
ORM for accessing data in text files so

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,250
in particular it lets you have

00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,159
structures like this where you have

00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,689
files in a tree under different model

00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:22,610
names so here example I have all my

00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:24,500
talks from this year in one llamo file

00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,630
they look a little bit like this so

00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,399
nicely formatted you can go through I

00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:30,470
can do edits on these easy on the plane

00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:32,420
and then what lets you do is use the

00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,890
Django around to query them like this so

00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,630
you say oh I just wanted talk to these

00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,570
normally that normal Django models and

00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:41,479
do sorting and filtering and even gets

00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,950
and stuff like that so how does it work

00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:45,710
well it's kind of really simple and

00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:47,750
awful yeah simultaneously so what you do

00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:51,079
is it reads the ML files that you saw

00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:53,329
previously into memory sort of like

00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:55,430
normal Django fixtures it then makes an

00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:57,920
in-memory sequel like database it then

00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,350
uses Django's internal migrations code

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,210
to make tables in that database it then

00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,280
writes the models into that database and

00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,750
saves them and then it then routes

00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,360
queries for them using a database router

00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,770
to that database all on every startup of

00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,890
your sub piece of software cuz that's a

00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:14,720
great idea so it would take a couple of

00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:16,880
things it is just like normal yeah Mille

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,800
Django's low data which does fixtures is

00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,510
very similar if you look inside low data

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,300
it's just kind of reading yeah Mille and

00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:25,370
JSON and just does make a model instance

00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,050
model dot save make another one don't

00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,370
say that's all this does too

00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,080
obviously the animal if you don't know

00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:33,920
this use safe load because normal load

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,570
can do code execution very bad I use the

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,830
schema editor for the database it's as

00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,440
amazing piece of software written by

00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:41,030
some guy I'm sure you know but what it

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,430
lets you do is you can take just a bit

00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,620
that makes tables and say hey I want to

00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:47,120
pass this model and make a table for it

00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,290
outside of migrations it's kind of a

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,480
simple way of doing it's like three

00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:52,670
lines if you're curious just an

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,890
interesting lead to look at and it also

00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:57,500
uses a thing in Python 3.4 which is new

00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,540
which is sequel lights database memory

00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,790
your eyes so sequel light used to have a

00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,790
thing called : memory : which is just

00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:06,320
hey I want an in-memory database and it

00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,760
was thread-local and every connection

00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,190
was a brand new one you couldn't share

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,510
it very easily sequel lights come along

00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,760
since then it lets you do shared

00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,800
databases like this is shared across all

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,260
my threads it has caching and local

00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,510
stuff in it and unfortunately you need

00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,310
your eyes to do this and python 3 4 is

00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,800
the first version supports sequel like

00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:28,040
your eyes so it's not great but hey

00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,500
there you go and so the result is I have

00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,030
my website redesign almost done pages

00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,610
like this are powered entirely off of

00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,410
this fake yeah Mel based RM it's pretty

00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:38,480
great you can just go in there and say I

00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:40,040
want to have all the places grouped by

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,230
the different section and order by name

00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,870
it just works and I can edit these in my

00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,190
git repository very easily if you want

00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,200
to go and download it it's on github

00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:50,690
right now I pushed it up about 10

00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,400
minutes ago it has a readme it has some

00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:54,550
documentation I don't promise it'll work

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,400
but it works for me standard disclaimer

00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:00,010
and then finally one last plug I and

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,330
some other people are helping run a

00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,830
community conference in the North Bay of

00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:06,560
the Bay Area called North Bay Python if

00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:08,780
you are curious please come and talk to

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,810
me or follow us on Twitter or go to a

00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:14,110
website we have a cfpk up soon thank you

00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,110
very much

00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,230
so I have a mild content warning here

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,760
I've tried to make sure there's nothing

00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,470
too horrible in here but if you are

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,550
squeamish there will be artificial eyes

00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:28,889
in this presentation in large numbers

00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:31,110
but yeah so just over a year ago my wife

00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:33,150
remove I my wife and I were involved in

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,479
a pretty nasty car accident over in

00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:39,810
Yellowstone Park and I ended up down one

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,250
eye which sucks you know um but I did

00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,940
get to learn what it takes to get a new

00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,800
one made

00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,060
so I'm now I you can come and come and

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,260
see me in the corridor later and see if

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,430
you can tell which of my eyes actually

00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,010
you'll know because I'm about to show

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:52,620
you one of my eyes is is no longer real

00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:54,540
it's an artificial eye and I'm going to

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,790
talk about what it takes to make one of

00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,889
those because an unexpected highlight of

00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:00,900
this otherwise pretty awful experience

00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:04,110
is I got to learn all about my making um

00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,910
so if you need a new eye mate and I have

00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:09,180
got a very good recommendation so talk

00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,410
to me if you need lead the first thing

00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,410
you have to do is pick your eye maker

00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,870
and I make is called oculist there are

00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:17,789
about 300 of them in the United States

00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,050
it's a very niche profession and it

00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:20,370
turns out there's not an enormous amount

00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,690
of demand for this but just enough to

00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,320
monitor to keep a professional

00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:27,210
association going and fascinating I bet

00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,919
this is a family profession if you want

00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,330
to make eyes there aren't that many

00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:32,220
places to learn to do it you basically

00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,870
have to apprentice with someone and it

00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,490
turns out that ocularis are almost all

00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,440
related to each other and they they

00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,330
thought they have these apprenticeship

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,830
family relationships and I think it's a

00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,080
fascinating thing because it's both an

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,500
art a craft and medicine all rolled into

00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,190
one

00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,870
so I talked to four ocularis in the San

00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:50,520
Francisco Bay Area which is basically

00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,229
all of them because why would you miss

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,020
out on an excuse to meet people who make

00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:56,849
eyes and and one of the things I showed

00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,260
them obviously was was show me show me

00:05:56,849 --> 00:06:00,240
show me what you got show me your eyes

00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:02,220
so these are some of the eyes that I was

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,280
shown by various ocularis that I didn't

00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,289
pick and then I met this guy who had

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,270
this beautiful box and eyes this is the

00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:10,470
guy I ended up picking and these are the

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,030
eyes that he showed me this is

00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,940
collection of blue eyes he has a

00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:17,370
separate box for all of the brown eyes

00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:19,770
and his name's William Dan's he's been

00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,780
doing this for 45 years and he is a

00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,669
fifth-generation ocularist his

00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,260
grandfather his great grandfather all

00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:26,940
the way back to like I think the 18th

00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,569
century in Germany his family have been

00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,219
made

00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:31,679
King Eyes originally out of glass and

00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:34,800
these days out of acrylic plastic and

00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:36,360
oil paints and his son is apprentice

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,520
thing under him so I got to meet his son

00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,860
who will be a sixth generation or last

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,719
as well and so it turns out it's a

00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,969
three-day process essentially you go in

00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:47,099
for three consecutive days to because

00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:49,349
all of these things that made custom to

00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:50,550
fit you they have to you know match up

00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:52,559
to your other eye cuz otherwise it's

00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:55,649
going to look a bit weird so day one is

00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:56,909
the mold I decided to cut the photograph

00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,439
of this because this is probably the

00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:59,939
most distressing part of it all but

00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:01,740
essentially this is the same stuff they

00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:04,229
use for dent taking dental impressions

00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,270
and they sort of squirt it in get a mold

00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:08,490
of the the gap that the artificial I was

00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:10,680
going into and and take that away and

00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,300
use that to create the eye day two is

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,539
where it gets really fun and because

00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,919
that's the fitting so he's got a mold he

00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:18,809
makes the eye out of acrylic plastic

00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,430
just just the shape but he needs to

00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:22,860
figure out where the pupil is going to

00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:26,610
go and so he draws it on with a felt-tip

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,949
pen this is a this this is my actual eye

00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,059
but at an earlier stage when it was when

00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,409
he was still trying to work out where

00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:33,659
things going and then I have a video

00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,709
which give you a few screws you might

00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:35,399
want to look away but I don't think it's

00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:38,279
too bad

00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:40,409
is that animating there we go yeah so he

00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:42,289
pops it in and uses that to make sure

00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:45,269
that he's getting it in the right place

00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:47,329
and based on that the exciting day is

00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:50,339
day three day three is the painting and

00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:52,110
you'd expect that painting and I would

00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:54,029
be done mainly from photographs and but

00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,159
that doesn't work because a photo might

00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:58,050
not have the exact colors that are going

00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,809
to match your real eye so you have to go

00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,909
in and actually sit for the painting so

00:08:00,809 --> 00:08:04,740
here he is holding up his this eye that

00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:07,379
he's been working on comparing it to my

00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,399
my real eye and making adjustments and

00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:11,729
just making sure that he gets that

00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:13,889
painting exactly right and because we

00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:15,360
expressed great enthusiasm at learning

00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:16,889
more he took us back in tears of oratory

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,319
and showed showed us where the magic

00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:23,039
happens this is straight it's just

00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:26,189
regular oil paints on plastic that right

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,389
there is the I'm old so this is this is

00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:29,519
the mold that he made from that

00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:32,310
impression and that's my eye being in

00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,419
the process of being painted and the the

00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:36,000
veins on it

00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:38,550
Arum pieces of red silk thread because

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,469
this is the best possible and this is

00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,120
the best way to get them get the

00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:43,880
illusion of

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,320
to tear little bits of thread and to

00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,140
have the threads apart and then tweezer

00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,589
them on um so you add all of that

00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:54,470
together um this is a video of the

00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:56,870
moment that I got my new eye so and it

00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:58,790
goes and there it is the reason it can

00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,320
move is I've got a permanent implant in

00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,660
the socket that's wired into the muscles

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,100
and then the artificial eye just sits on

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,460
top of that so I've actually got quite a

00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:10,250
good amount of of movement from it and

00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,810
this is the finished eye and that's how

00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,310
you make an eye come and ask me

00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:19,190
questions later if you want to know more

00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:20,720
thank you hi I'm Katie my twitter handle

00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:24,200
is hidden somewhere on this slide if you

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:28,940
want to live tweet about my talk so hi

00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:33,440
I've been thinking um I don't speak your

00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:39,529
language I don't speak American what I

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:41,420
speak is Aussie get a Australian is not

00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:46,180
American there are some slight

00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:46,180
differences this is how I spell color

00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:54,480
this is how I spell Center this makes

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:58,410
CSS really fun

00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,769
this is how I spell localization and I

00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:02,880
like to be able to use languages at

00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:04,500
programs computers applications in my

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,190
own language so localization is

00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,670
important

00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:10,320
so I've been thinking this is Django

00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,660
thing you may have heard of it there's

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,480
this wonderful welcome page and you get

00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:18,209
an administration area and if you speak

00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,250
American you can read this but what

00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:23,279
about everyone else

00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:25,310
so by default you get American there is

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:29,810
a partial translation for Australian

00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:33,389
however I don't only speak Australian I

00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:40,139
speak emoji so today I am announcing

00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:43,440
this translation I translated the entire

00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:52,709
Django 1.11 framework into emoji you're

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:55,290
welcome I specifically chose not to

00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:57,779
translate the Python into emoji because

00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:00,260
that wouldn't actually work this is the

00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:02,930
main site aiming page

00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,040
so you've got a Django admin site admin

00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,440
and then you've got your groups and your

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,080
users and you can go in and you can add

00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,490
new users you cannot add to user that is

00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,210
just a merger character

00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:17,090
sadly um but you can edit users and it's

00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:18,830
all there and that's really great

00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:20,780
because it's really hard to try to

00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:25,250
translate hashing algorithms into just

00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:26,930
emoji um you can also add your passwords

00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,370
and all that but the wonderful little

00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,960
listing of what you have to do for your

00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,850
passwords I did translate that exactly

00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,590
so for those playing at home your

00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:37,520
password cannot be too similar to any

00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:39,470
other personal information your password

00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,350
must contain at least 8 characters or

00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:44,930
your custom setting your password cannot

00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:46,930
be a commonly used password and your

00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:50,930
password cannot be entirely in your work

00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:52,730
that's great um and if you notice very

00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:55,100
closely there is still some

00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:56,960
english-american in there these are

00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,760
strings that as far as I can tell you

00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:03,590
can't actually translate and they stick

00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:05,420
out really badly um and you can create

00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:07,880
groups that are single emoji so there is

00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:11,780
a group in this particular setup that is

00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:13,610
just a unicorn emoji and then you can

00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:16,940
delete your groups again and stuff so um

00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:19,070
that is a mji and new translation I had

00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:23,810
this all up on my github under the repo

00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:25,880
Millenial you're welcome Django has a

00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:27,920
bunch of actual languages that P

00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,590
collects people actually fluently speak

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,150
we have Welsh we also have a whole bunch

00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:35,390
of other translations but there's so

00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:37,610
many so many so many incomplete

00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:39,710
translations that if you happen to speak

00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:42,770
any of these languages please help out

00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:45,140
it would be really great um and there is

00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:47,660
this one that is partial and does anyone

00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:50,900
know what this particular code is yell

00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:52,760
it out it's Klingon there is a partial

00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,390
translation already there this is not me

00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,480
I swear

00:12:53,390 --> 00:13:00,129
after Jango a minority and Klingon yeah

00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,769
and that is an actual real emoji as well

00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:05,230
so um but if you are seriously

00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:07,930
interested in translating and know any

00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:09,790
language other than American go into the

00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,529
documentation it's really great it's

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,660
really easy to sign up to the

00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:15,189
translation service and please help out

00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,009
because it'd be really great if other

00:13:15,189 --> 00:13:24,160
people can use Django in your language

00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:25,930
Thanks good afternoon class

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,120
I'm dr. Russell Keith McGee this is a

00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,829
moji archaeology 101 if you're looking

00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,970
for dr. Bennett's class on making the

00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:33,779
most of your Django Illuminati

00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:36,550
membership it's just down the hall in

00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:38,620
1963 the human emotion of happiness was

00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:40,509
created it was created by the American

00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,850
Xavier Ross ball who was employed to

00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:44,589
create an image of a happy face to raise

00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:47,379
the morale of employees at an insurance

00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:49,209
company but once people realize that it

00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:51,029
was possible to express emotions they

00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:53,620
wanted to express emotions of their own

00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:56,500
in a New York Times interview in April

00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:58,000
1969 Vladimir Nabokov said I often think

00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,610
there should exist a special

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,250
typographical sign for a smile some kind

00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:05,889
of concave marker supine round bracket

00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:07,089
and then in 1982 Scott Farland had a

00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:09,310
breakthrough when he proposed the

00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:11,370
composition of three ASCII characters as

00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:14,110
a trigraph to express an emotion

00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:15,670
happiness although these code points

00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,439
don't in themselves represent any

00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,750
emotional context if composed

00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:21,639
horizontally they combine to provide a

00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,439
powerful expression which the user can

00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:27,130
comprehend simply by turning one's head

00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:28,870
90 degrees to the left while happiness

00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,459
does have significant utility as an

00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,240
emotion users felt it was not meeting

00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:33,310
all of their needs

00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,230
however by replacing the third code

00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:37,480
point the much more functional emotion

00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:39,250
of unhappiness could be expressed this

00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,139
ironically led to much higher levels of

00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,579
happiness because users were now able to

00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:44,589
voice displeasure at everyone that

00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:46,660
disagreed with them thus began a

00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:48,610
Precambrian explosion in the expression

00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:50,410
of emotion as users realized the hidden

00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,240
potential of the u.s. ASCII code point

00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:54,189
said the first changes were simple

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,509
issues of ergonomics by reversing the

00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:57,430
code point Auto it was possible to

00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:59,559
evenly spread the physical of the

00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:02,259
physical exertion required to express

00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:03,970
emotion most sophisticated extensions

00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:06,189
were then added such as adornments

00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:08,350
wearing glasses and an optical tiredness

00:15:06,189 --> 00:15:10,250
from staring deep into the ASCII code

00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:12,320
chart looking for emotional inspiration

00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,300
there was also a move to represent more

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,820
extreme emotions such as extreme

00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,680
happiness some are some expressions of

00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,360
extremist couldn't be embedded in a

00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,680
simple 3 glyph they require the

00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,290
introduction of a fourth glyph to

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,440
demonstrate scorn or to embody a simple

00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:29,000
tear rolling down the face some purists

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,620
felt that the three code-point limit

00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,900
should be retained and so they

00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,240
compressed complex emotions losing the

00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:37,310
fidelity of nasal expression others

00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,440
freed themselves of NRI constraints

00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:41,920
allowing for the rendition of say the

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,980
absurdist philosopher Homer Simpson or

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,940
beneficent midwinter courier Santa Claus

00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,500
others revisited the premise that

00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:50,120
emoticons had to be press pressed

00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,130
horizontally and looked to the

00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,620
perpendicular as a presentation style

00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:56,600
however the US ASCII code set was

00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,950
reaching its limit at this point this

00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,900
led to the introduction of Unicode

00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,400
providing vastly more alternatives with

00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,830
which to construct even deeper

00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,480
expressions of emotion it's not clear

00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,070
for the literature that any of these

00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,190
glyphs are actually used in their leaked

00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:12,200
languages of origin the schism between

00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:13,520
minimalists and maximalists in the

00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,530
expression of emotion reached its zenith

00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,510
in this pair of expressions the 11

00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:19,550
character table flip as the ultimate

00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:21,440
expression of anger and a single

00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:23,750
katakana character as an expression of

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,310
simple happiness unfortunately pressure

00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,560
was placed upon the Unicode consortium

00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:29,270
to allow more literal expressions of

00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,130
emotion this started with simple

00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:33,140
renditions but over time these

00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:35,960
expressions became more and more literal

00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:37,610
removing all subtlety and nuance and

00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,350
indeed beauty from the process of

00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,700
emotional expression perhaps best

00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,589
demonstrated by the introduction of the

00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,570
pile of Putin will allowing scatological

00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:47,720
references without the need to know what

00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:49,760
scatological means this has been

00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,770
accompanied by a loss of agency in the

00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,690
past users could simply disruptively

00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:56,120
innovate and develop their own emotions

00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,950
but like some sort of Big Brother only

00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,990
those emotions approved by the unicode

00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,280
consortium may be expressed it doesn't

00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,110
matter if you like banana splits the

00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,880
consortium the savage arbiter of the

00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,350
sapir-whorf hypothesis has determined

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,510
that you shall not express those ideas

00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:10,520
and no longer maybe compose those

00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:12,140
symbols to cook trait rich new emotions

00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,689
only those compositions are proved by

00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,370
the consortium are permitted the modern

00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:17,990
emoji represents a significant loss of

00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,970
our collective culture the ability to

00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,530
embody happiness in the 8 bits of

00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,959
storage necessary to display a right

00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:24,069
bracket this lease

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,740
is the essence of the human condition

00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:28,630
this is who we are we are not Stardust

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,580
we are not the champions we are not a

00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:33,309
number we are emotions trapped in a

00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:35,230
brittle corporeal manifestation so what

00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:36,700
are we to do some might call for emoji

00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,470
to be eliminated to be struck from our

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,570
collective history but that is defeat we

00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:42,760
should fight for our emotions so rise up

00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:44,679
rise up my children smash the control

00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,850
image smash the control emoji smash the

00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:46,690
control machine we have nothing to lose

00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,100
but our chains

00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,360
do not be constrained by the limits

00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,700
placed upon you by the consortium

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,950
composed you emotions and express them

00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:56,289
express them deeply and longingly and

00:17:53,950 --> 00:18:02,500
aaron woodley and before someone asks

00:17:56,289 --> 00:18:03,399
yes this will be on the exam well I'm

00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,279
not getting my notes

00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:08,110
so let's wing this okay so hi my name is

00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:10,960
Andrew Pinkham and I'm here to talk to

00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:13,779
you about the improved user so Django

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,570
has an existing user model it gives you

00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:18,970
all of these um the problem is this

00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:23,350
isn't necessarily what you want out of

00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:24,880
your user model so this made a lot of

00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:27,130
sense when it was shipped but nowadays

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,899
you just want to login with an email you

00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:30,880
want a password and for international

00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,559
reasons you usually don't want a first

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,510
name in our last name that doesn't work

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,130
in a whole lot of countries so you might

00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:40,539
think about a short name or a full name

00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:42,220
maybe so if you've read my book Django

00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:44,860
Unleashed you know that I've I sort of

00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,409
go through and I talk about how to build

00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:49,630
this and as a consultant at jambon

00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:53,919
software I was taking that code and just

00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:55,960
copying and pasting it when working with

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,990
Russ Russ pointed out that this was

00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:01,149
really really really really dumb um this

00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:05,500
is what he looked like when he told me

00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:07,659
this this is I didn't um and so we went

00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:11,020
ahead and we created a reusable app

00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:13,899
called Django improved user it's fairly

00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:15,730
creative so genuine improved user goes

00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:17,880
ahead and it just does email

00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:20,890
authentication it gives you a password

00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,440
there's a full name and a short name and

00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,970
you can compose all of these if you

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,590
would like to go ahead and do that and

00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,600
it includes all the stuff that you need

00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:32,590
to sort of get the ball rolling forms

00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:35,830
admin if you're using the factory boy

00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:38,019
you can we have a test factory for you

00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:40,690
and all of this is tested in Django 1.8

00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:43,360
1.10 1.11 so if you're starting a new

00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:44,710
Django project we hope that you find

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,080
this really really useful

00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:49,750
a quick note is that right now the

00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:53,620
version on pipe I is actually version

00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:55,659
0.3 0.4 is going to be shipped out very

00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,159
very soon does this mean that it's

00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:58,860
really in beta no we're using this in

00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:01,960
production in like four or five places

00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:03,700
the only thing that's really that we're

00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,890
waiting for for version 1 is improved

00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,230
documentation I'm working on it

00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:09,970
I would love some feedback if people

00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,860
have done a lot with user models I would

00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,480
love to hear like are we helping here

00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,940
are there any changes that we could we

00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:19,389
could make to sort of do that and on the

00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,769
document documentation side if if anyone

00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:22,630
feels like writing documentation that

00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:30,490
sort of thing we would love some help so

00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:32,110
thank you very much yeah so what I want

00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:34,929
to talk about is the fact that the cloud

00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:36,909
isn't a hundred percent available all

00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:38,799
the services that we can use that make

00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:41,380
our lives easier can and will go down

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,450
and the time that that happens is not

00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,789
the time to fix it you don't really want

00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,529
to be live coding while your payment

00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:49,659
processor is down to make sure that

00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:53,230
things that make sure that your site

00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:55,120
doesn't blow up and so we had a client

00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:58,299
and we had done an MVP on a store

00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,909
launched it everything was great payment

00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:02,590
processor went down and so that was when

00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:04,690
we started to get a flood of five

00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:07,179
hundred emails from places that we

00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:08,649
hadn't quite planned for this and what

00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:10,090
that did is it meant all right it's time

00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:13,120
to buckle down it's time to harden the

00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:14,110
application and make that work better so

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,490
I just want to give you some of my

00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:17,289
inspiration some of the things that I've

00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:19,149
learned so that you can do this it's

00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:22,590
actually not as hard as I thought it

00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:24,580
would be so the first thing you to do is

00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:26,679
actually more of a business decision

00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,630
than a technology decision and that's to

00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:30,909
think about all the different touch

00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:33,940
points that you have to outside vendors

00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:36,039
and think about what you want to do if

00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:37,750
they fail if your credit card processor

00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:41,019
is down do you want to store information

00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:42,909
and do authorizations later do you want

00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:45,700
to hard fail probably not the greatest

00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:49,690
idea but it's it's a valid ID valid way

00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:51,610
and yeah so same thing with sales tax

00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:55,029
you may use a vendor to tell you that

00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:57,250
are you going to email every customer

00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:59,139
that made a transaction and say we're

00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:01,059
actually gonna charge you this this much

00:21:59,139 --> 00:22:05,620
more because our sales tax vendor was

00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:07,990
down transaction alerting anything else

00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,850
in the cloud you're basically gonna go

00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:14,200
through and figure out what do we want

00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:16,360
to do with that in mind you you can you

00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,309
can tune and say hey are we gonna

00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,860
display a 500 or are we gonna have a

00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:23,710
generic message that pops up and says we

00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:25,029
couldn't get to a vendor or are you just

00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:27,970
gonna adjust the messaging for each

00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:30,100
instance so that it doesn't say you know

00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:31,559
this terrible thing happened when all it

00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:35,019
was is you couldn't send them an email

00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:36,580
that their order had gone through there

00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:37,990
are multiple levels of failure in the

00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,840
application ranging all the way from

00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:45,100
lack of datalink just unplug the network

00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:47,529
cable dns resolution I'll often I keep

00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:50,769
records in my router at home so that I

00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:52,179
can override various vendors and say you

00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:55,659
know you go to one two seven zero zero

00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:58,179
one but then the rest we need software

00:22:55,659 --> 00:23:01,299
and so we can do timeouts connections

00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:06,210
refused and anything other than the HTTP

00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:08,470
response that it would suspect so

00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:11,379
depending on your vendors this will be

00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:13,480
either really easy or not so easy

00:23:11,379 --> 00:23:14,919
Braintree is actually kind of nice they

00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,129
give you the ability to do Braintree

00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:20,980
environments and so you can set up this

00:23:18,129 --> 00:23:23,799
use Braintree configuration configure

00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:27,220
and now I'm pointing Braintree to a

00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:29,440
local a local server that I just set up

00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:33,519
a URL that matches what they would be

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:37,029
calling return HTTP okay we'll go into

00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:39,250
more detail one call out unless you're

00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:41,049
running a local proxy with SSL you're

00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,629
probably gonna have to find some way to

00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:47,950
turn off SSL because your payment

00:23:43,629 --> 00:23:50,830
processor wants you to use that if it's

00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:54,279
not configurable like stripe who just

00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:56,500
hard codes their API strings in in their

00:23:54,279 --> 00:24:00,190
init module you can always monkey patch

00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:01,869
override at runtime this is not

00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,399
something we're putting into production

00:24:01,869 --> 00:24:06,820
it's just something we're using to test

00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:10,389
production if it's soap it gets even

00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:13,149
more challenging because soap has wisdom

00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:15,879
and wisdoms connect two different URLs

00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:18,159
for different end points the way that I

00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:20,349
found best to do that is I download the

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,690
wisdom as it save it as a template and

00:24:20,349 --> 00:24:25,839
then build a view that renders that with

00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:28,239
URLs this is the view that I use in

00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:31,389
order to do that and so I'm able to use

00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:33,519
the same view for the whistle and in the

00:24:31,389 --> 00:24:35,619
option you can see there's a 50 second

00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,969
time out there that's usually enough you

00:24:35,619 --> 00:24:39,219
may have to tweak it depending on what

00:24:36,969 --> 00:24:41,859
what the vendors module is set to wait

00:24:39,219 --> 00:24:44,919
for and then it just ends you can also

00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:46,629
return weird status codes I just usually

00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:48,369
leave a bunch of them commented and I'm

00:24:46,629 --> 00:24:51,219
like well I want to time this one out oh

00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:51,700
I want to do bad requests and and go

00:24:51,219 --> 00:24:54,729
from there

00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,839
and then use your unit tests selenium

00:24:54,729 --> 00:24:57,940
Suites if you've got them

00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:59,589
spider you know just set something loose

00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:02,229
that follow all salt follows all the

00:24:59,589 --> 00:25:04,479
links on your site and then lastly tests

00:25:02,229 --> 00:25:06,429
as a user do what they would be doing

00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:16,929
and see what they're seeing and then

00:25:06,429 --> 00:25:18,940
retest often hi I'm Josh

00:25:16,929 --> 00:25:20,379
does anyone here use Django storages

00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,330
pretty popular

00:25:20,379 --> 00:25:23,559
yeah if any of you uses read uh mr.

00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:25,479
Jiang of sorge's redux please upgrade

00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:25,809
because I don't maintain that one

00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:29,070
anymore

00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:31,539
we become general storages cool so yeah

00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:33,099
I'm here to talk to you about the Django

00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:35,349
storages library which is I think the

00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:36,789
most popular library for plugging into

00:25:35,349 --> 00:25:38,169
the you know you want to toast your

00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:40,629
files in s3 you want to host your files

00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:42,369
in Azure Google Cloud whatever not the

00:25:40,629 --> 00:25:45,159
most interesting library but necessary

00:25:42,369 --> 00:25:45,489
so I want to talk about past present and

00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:48,849
future

00:25:45,489 --> 00:25:51,099
so general storage is is super old

00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:53,229
project it's actually pretty 1.0 I think

00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:55,299
jingle 1.0 is when the storage API

00:25:53,229 --> 00:25:57,879
shipped and it basically hasn't changed

00:25:55,299 --> 00:26:00,789
modulo some minor max length features

00:25:57,879 --> 00:26:03,339
and and such since then and this project

00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:07,929
came out you know I guess the guy who

00:26:03,339 --> 00:26:09,070
wrote it David Laurel it wrote it so at

00:26:07,929 --> 00:26:12,909
one point I was gonna look like and

00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:14,769
released it with s3 starting followed by

00:26:12,909 --> 00:26:16,950
a bunch of other ones that since been

00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:20,309
removed like mobile

00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:22,320
anyway it was pretty much abandoned in

00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:25,230
2014 which is when I was working on a

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,780
project that was heavily international

00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:29,400
so we decided to do Python 3 which is

00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,660
also when I think Python 3 became

00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,420
obvious it was gonna win there was like

00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:35,340
a lot of talk about Python 2.8 and stuff

00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:37,160
like that until we know it one of the PI

00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:41,640
cons was like nope not happening sorry

00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:43,950
so I you know we shipping a django site

00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:47,309
every project was upgraded to Python 3

00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:48,690
except this one so I forked it comped it

00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:52,500
on all the bit bucket things like hey

00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:54,900
look at my 4 come use it and as Django

00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:57,179
sorge's Redux and about a year a bit

00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,400
later I became the official successor

00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:04,800
Django storages so that's where we are

00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:06,750
today and we're shipping 9 backends Co

00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:09,000
quality and how much each of them are

00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,559
used across I'd say varies certainly the

00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,900
s3 ones are heavily used and there's

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,520
also you know a lot of demand for Google

00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:19,140
Cloud which was at it because Google's

00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:21,750
and pushing out as your Dropbox man this

00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,429
is my first time maintaining anything no

00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:26,610
one ever told me it's a complete pain I

00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:28,230
think it's really Sochi because I didn't

00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:31,350
write the software you know I'm doing

00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:34,290
with oh man so I work on it as I have

00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:38,070
time and motivation finally got in the

00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:40,770
Google cloud back-end took a while II

00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:43,050
opposed a 3 & 2 but that's what it is it

00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:49,110
is what it is so I have like a road map

00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:51,570
of this that I'm hoping to go forward

00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:54,150
with here's some ideas I see about

00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:57,480
halfway through so right now the test

00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:59,070
suite uses mock which is awesome and is

00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,110
a great idea if you're making web calls

00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:03,360
if your whole library is wrapping web

00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:05,730
web stuff like cloud things I think this

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,620
is a terrible idea like I strip a ton of

00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:10,650
not a time because I don't ship a lot

00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,970
but there's there have been regressions

00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,650
because you know we mock out the

00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,970
connection call and then the connection

00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,550
doesn't get called and that's basically

00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:19,070
what the point of the library is so the

00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:23,880
test suite I think should be done live

00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:26,040
there's a ton I'm a big believer in the

00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,870
UNIX philosophy I mean I used them for

00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:30,760
for Christ's sake like

00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:32,380
and but and this obviously this library

00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,990
completely breaks that right jurors

00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:37,030
mixed in with boto and like I've never

00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:39,190
needed a sure but I used both to all the

00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:41,020
time but actually think this makes sense

00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:42,190
in this case it's not a completely you

00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,990
know it's I don't think it's a very hard

00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:45,190
problem there's just an API but there's

00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,900
a ton of different service providers and

00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,820
there's a lot of commonality if you're a

00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:52,120
one cloud provider to a next so I think

00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:54,430
makes a lot of sense it's also a lot of

00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:57,370
legacy stuff you know there's this AWS

00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:58,900
preload metadata setting which every

00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:00,250
time we break the same person comes

00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,750
around three months later being like hey

00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:04,240
this is broken I'll be like oh sorry

00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:06,429
about that so you know I don't even

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,110
think we really need that so I've been

00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:09,760
thinking a lot like what can I do with

00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:11,440
this because I get a ton emails about it

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,650
a lot of stress because I'm not

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,059
responding to the emails about it and so

00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,740
I what I would like to do is fix this

00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:19,780
once and for all for everyone and then

00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:21,250
maybe submit to Jazz Band which if you

00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:24,070
guys don't know is sort of like an an

00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:27,340
aegis project for Django projects that

00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:31,720
are popular in the community stable and

00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:33,850
are maintained by a group I mean I sort

00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,470
of remember the you know Python standard

00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:37,960
libraries where libraries go to die but

00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:41,980
if it works and it's good enough you

00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:44,170
know so I need some help you i freelance

00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,210
full-time I do not have the one month of

00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:48,400
work it would take for me to fix this by

00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:50,230
myself so if your company wants to

00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,510
donate time or money or you're

00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:54,429
interested in sprinting on it people

00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:56,470
lots of people have emailed me I join us

00:29:54,429 --> 00:29:57,790
Co maintainer z-- they merge them if

00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,030
each their pet feature I never see them

00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:01,900
again

00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:03,850
so I've listed out some major projects

00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,920
and I'm getting a talk on this and other

00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:08,340
stuff tomorrow so hope to see you there

00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,340
thanks

00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:18,240
alright so I'm gonna do a lightning talk

00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:20,970
related to kpop and programming so do we

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,480
have any Korean speakers in the room yes

00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:28,169
no yes any Chinese speakers Mandarin

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,590
Chinese speakers one okay so I'll go

00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:33,900
into the selected me start my timer

00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:35,700
again being fair all right so I'm gonna

00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,500
I'll go into the select the the jingle

00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:41,460
count slack and I'll close to two videos

00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:45,630
a little later from YouTube this is a

00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:47,580
video by a group called EXO specifically

00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:51,480
X okay and this is the Korean version

00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:55,710
and so this group performs in Korean and

00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:57,360
in Mandarin so hence exo-k and exo-m the

00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,980
way this thing you're thinking well okay

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,169
that's exciting in kocha you're not

00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:02,610
really but you're wondering probably

00:31:01,169 --> 00:31:04,410
well how does this relate to programming

00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:06,480
one of the things as developers that we

00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:07,890
often hear about programmers who are

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,350
being hired is that people are looking

00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:12,510
for rock stars and a rock star

00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:14,340
programmer when we think of a roth job

00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:16,620
we tend to think of someone who is a

00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:18,720
high-performing individual may it may

00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:20,070
not work well with the team now if

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,620
you've actually done any sort of

00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:24,660
professional software development or if

00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,919
you just contributed to any sort of an

00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:28,530
open-source project you recognize that

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,390
software is built in teams it's not

00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:32,460
there's not just a lone genius who goes

00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:33,990
off onto a mountain top and then writes

00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:36,030
the wicked codes and then we all use it

00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:39,150
and it's wonderful it's usually software

00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:45,660
was built by teams and so if you are

00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:48,900
looking at hiring if you're looking at

00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:50,790
hiring people to build software for you

00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,620
you want someone's gonna be a better

00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:54,660
team player and so as opposed to a rock

00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:56,580
star what you want is you want a kpop

00:31:54,660 --> 00:32:00,119
idol

00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:02,700
and so the question there is why k-pop

00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:04,830
idols are generally very well trained

00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,950
but as you can see here they functioned

00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:09,899
very well as teams and this is one of

00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:13,109
what really one of the defining aspects

00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:15,719
of k-pop idols and so it's a little bit

00:32:13,109 --> 00:32:17,549
humorous but it's also a billion dollars

00:32:15,719 --> 00:32:19,499
worth of true there are at least two

00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:21,269
billion dollar publicly-traded companies

00:32:19,499 --> 00:32:23,820
who are built around the kpop industry

00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:24,929
this group performing here EXO there

00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,820
Kurt

00:32:24,929 --> 00:32:28,169
they are currently the flagship male

00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,489
group for a company called SM

00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:30,599
Entertainment which is valued at over a

00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,519
billion dollars in the Korean stock

00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:35,719
market so what are some of the defining

00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:38,339
characteristics of the k-pop idols one

00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:41,399
everyone has a specific defined role so

00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:45,659
you have vocalists you have dancers you

00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:47,279
have rappers and then you also have

00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:48,419
visuals who are more trained in acting

00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,559
those are the people who show up in

00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:52,320
television shows things of that nature

00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:53,700
so everyone has a clear role in and they

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,989
know what they're going to do but even

00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,509
more important than that and something

00:32:54,989 --> 00:32:59,549
that I think is missing in the American

00:32:56,509 --> 00:33:02,129
programming industry is the aspect of

00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:04,679
training so most of the gentlemen you

00:33:02,129 --> 00:33:06,359
see here have been trainees therefore

00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:07,950
these guys are in there like early to

00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,899
mid-20s now many of them have been

00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:12,450
training since they were at 12 13 14

00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:14,489
years old and so they have been trained

00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:16,889
to be these vocals to these rappers

00:33:14,489 --> 00:33:18,329
these dancers if you're looking to bring

00:33:16,889 --> 00:33:21,089
in quality people to help you build

00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:22,799
quality software your organization needs

00:33:21,089 --> 00:33:25,829
to have some sort of way to bring people

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:27,239
in and then help them become the DevOps

00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:28,649
people the back-end developers the

00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:31,499
front-end developers you want them to be

00:33:28,649 --> 00:33:34,109
and so you need to take more of a kpop

00:33:31,499 --> 00:33:35,519
idol approach to bringing in people and

00:33:34,109 --> 00:33:36,929
training them to do to perform the

00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,999
functions you need them to perform for

00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:40,529
your organization to succeed instead of

00:33:38,999 --> 00:33:42,629
hoping you'll just go get a random rock

00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:45,059
star who will show up and because rock

00:33:42,629 --> 00:33:47,159
star I magic and fix everything so I'll

00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:49,769
put links to these two videos on any

00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:51,479
Chinese one in Korean in the django con

00:33:49,769 --> 00:33:53,820
slack but that's just a little something

00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:55,619
for you to think about yeah there's a

00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,549
lot you talk not spectacular but if I

00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:58,259
can do it you can do it too

00:33:56,549 --> 00:34:00,989
so keep that in mind maybe here maybe

00:33:58,259 --> 00:34:03,149
it's your next local meetup and with

00:34:00,989 --> 00:34:04,979
