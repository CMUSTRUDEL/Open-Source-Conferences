	DjangoCon US 2017 -  Using Django, Docker, and Scikit-learn to Bootstrap Your Machine Learning Project by Lorena Mesa

Reproducible results can be the bane of a data engineer or data scientistâ€™s existence. Perhaps a data scientist prototyped a model some months ago, tabled the project, only to return to it today. Itâ€™s now when they notice the inaccurate or lack of documentation in the feature engineering process. No one wins in that scenario.

In this talk weâ€™ll walk through how you can use Django to spin up a Docker container to handle the feature engineering required for a machine learning project and spit out a pickled model. From the version controlled Docker container we can version our models, store them as needed and use scikit-learn to generate predictions moving forward. Django will allow us to easily bootstrap a machine learning project removing the downtown required to setup a project and permit us to move quickly to having a model ready for exploration and ultimately production.

Machine learning done a bit easier? Yes please!
