	DjangoCon US 2017 - Keynote - Anxiety, Self-Advocacy, and Promoting Yourself by Tracy Osborn 

Over the last 10 years (and really, her entire life), Tracyâ€™s struggled with anxiety while running her own business, navigating negotiations, and self-publishing several books. This keynote will go through recommendations for keeping your sanity in a dog eat dog world, reducing anxiety, feeling comfortable with negotiation, and above all, being the best advocate for yourself that you can be.
