00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:58,209
look at this I was like ah last but not

00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:01,180
least I do a lot of conference speaking

00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:02,980
now this is my first keynote its fluent

00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,660
and you know it's a big deal when they

00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:08,230
have a giant projection of your face

00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:11,109
behind you that's cool and I've spoken

00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:15,900
at Jango Khan Europe earlier this year

00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:18,789
along with a bunch of other conferences

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:22,810
so that's that concludes the portion of

00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:24,910
my talk of here's why I'm awesome you

00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,440
knowing I'm kind of like a motivational

00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:29,320
speaker which is funny because when I

00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,700
was a kid I saw a lot of motivational

00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,979
speakers coming to my high school and I

00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,289
was just like I want to be you and

00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:36,970
there's like you know wow my life is

00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:38,200
awesome and here's how your life can be

00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,479
awesome which is kind of what I'm doing

00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,919
here but the thing is when you're

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,729
watching these motivational speakers if

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:48,400
you if I this is what I was an introvert

00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:50,349
high anxiety very very shy okay

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,650
you see these motivational speakers and

00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:54,729
I wanted to be them and but it was there

00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:58,060
was this little voice my head it was

00:04:54,729 --> 00:05:00,070
like I can't follow their advice because

00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,510
and with these motivational speakers

00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,669
these people have they know what they're

00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:06,700
doing and they're always like that you

00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:08,169
know those kids in like grade school it

00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,659
was like awesome kids that know what

00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:15,700
they're doing and there's like super

00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:17,260
ambitious and like outgoing and you're

00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,880
like oh yeah this motivational speaker

00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:31,659
they've always been like that they were

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:32,919
those kids times up I'm gone so you know

00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:34,210
when you see these motivational speakers

00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:35,590
and they're like oh yeah here's all this

00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,120
advice and you might be thinking oh yeah

00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:41,620
the advice is not applied to me because

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:44,409
I don't fit that mindset I'm not not

00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,240
outgoing like them I can't help promote

00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:47,820
like that because I'm an introvert and

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,530
they're an extrovert

00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,270
like I have anxiety I think I have

00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:56,469
anxiety and the advice does not apply to

00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:59,389
me the advice I have in this talk

00:05:56,469 --> 00:06:02,990
I'm gonna kind of go over of my life

00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:04,340
because I am NOT an extrovert I might go

00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,439
up here and I sound like I know what I'm

00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:09,520
doing and that's been like five years of

00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:11,539
really hard work to get to this point

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,719
it's been really really hard to get

00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:17,449
that's why I was I was a really

00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:21,939
screwed-up kid I was I had a lot of

00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:21,939
issues talking to people I had a lot of

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,270
bad thoughts about other people I didn't

00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,789
trust strangers I didn't trust people

00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,680
I'll get into that story in a second and

00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:32,479
I wanted to start this talk out with

00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,979
this huge disclaimer of my life is like

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,360
I'm gonna go into these like oh yeah

00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:37,819
here's some things you can do to improve

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,740
your career and you know become more

00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:42,110
outgoing and it's not because I've

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,699
always been outgoing myself like these

00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:49,419
are things that literally helped me get

00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:49,419
over these these issues I had growing up

00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:54,650
so it's taking a lot of work to get to

00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,779
where I am right now it's taken a lot of

00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:59,539
shortcuts I've had to figure out a lot

00:06:56,779 --> 00:07:01,550
of tactics in order to get myself to be

00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:04,339
comfortable on stage to be comfortable

00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:06,500
running a startup and fundraising the

00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:08,690
startup and writing a book and spelled

00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,860
self-promoting that book there's a lot

00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,240
of things I've learned over the last few

00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,270
years I've gotten to meet at this point

00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:18,800
that's taken me from this like really

00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:23,569
like you know Shia mess-up kid to where

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,310
I am right now so yeah I'm gonna go into

00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:30,740
my little background story let you know

00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:32,810
how how I all got I came here when I was

00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,879
two my parents divorced and I was like -

00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,800
ish but like for me basically my parents

00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,360
were never never a unit they were always

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:43,490
separate people lived in separate houses

00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:46,729
and when they divorced the courts at the

00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:49,789
time in the 80s I you know it's you know

00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:53,300
mother and father my dad was a wonderful

00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:56,180
stable stable person very wonderful

00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,759
person my mom while she loved me very

00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,610
much was an alcoholic with substance

00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:03,800
issues and unfortunately the courts at

00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:07,490
the time favor the mother

00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:10,669
so my die had the choice of either

00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:13,490
losing custody of me entirely and me

00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:16,130
living with my mom or to do this system

00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,930
of one year one year off one year with

00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,380
my dad and with my mom one year with my

00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,750
dad

00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,660
wonder if my mom and that's what that

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:26,000
was the best deal now my dad could get

00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:27,949
so that's what's my life growing up I

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,289
was moving constantly and it wasn't like

00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:33,260
my mom stayed in the same town because

00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:36,169
of her issues we moved at least every

00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:38,959
year sometimes multiple years so you

00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:40,610
know growing up it was going going - my

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,450
mom's in a new district I lived all over

00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:47,149
the California Bay Area constantly new

00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:48,980
schools new friends new bedroom me and

00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:53,510
my suitcase being transferred between

00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:56,870
parents in a McDonald's parking lot in

00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:59,270
Vallejo the strange thing is is like

00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,040
with my mom is always a new school year

00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:03,529
a new school dressed like new school

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,450
district and new friends but it was

00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:07,940
actually harder going back to my dad's

00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:09,830
because he was in the same place and I

00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:12,829
would go back to the school I was before

00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:15,589
and all my friends all my friends from

00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:18,260
two years before you know everyone the

00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:20,240
school knew who I was but all of my

00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,040
friends had moved on and so I had to

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,000
remake new friends with this really

00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,440
weird like like knowing but not knowing

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,450
like people had moved on and it became

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,339
comfortable like for my mom

00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:33,079
like those years I was the new kid and

00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:37,220
people would seek me out with my dad I

00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:39,410
wasn't I just I would bring this picture

00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:48,230
up because I am legit Cowboys and my

00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:50,450
family that's me and my dad so when I

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,310
was 12 things were getting worse and

00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:55,760
worse and worse for me my as I was

00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:57,829
growing up I became harder for me to

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,579
every year go out and make new friends

00:09:57,829 --> 00:10:04,010
and start anew you know in any school so

00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:06,470
twelve I was back at my dad's and I just

00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:07,190
gave up I decided I was not gonna have

00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:11,450
friends anymore

00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:12,589
like it was it was just too hard an LC

00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,720
or 12 they're going through a lot of

00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:16,370
issues and I just I just couldn't handle

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,079
it and I couldn't handle people and I

00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,880
distrusted everyone I had this like

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,750
mentality that all these kids in the

00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,459
school hated me

00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:25,250
and so why should I be friends with them

00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:28,220
and I would spend my lunches in this

00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,720
little corner of the quad like in this

00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,250
doorway of a teacher and she I remember

00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,029
her bringing me in and asking me he's

00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:37,310
like Tracy do you have friends which is

00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:40,310
like lady isn't that obvious like why am

00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:41,120
I here I probably was like yeah of

00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,890
course they do

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,579
can I go back to eating my lunch alone

00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:48,890
now about six months in this this one

00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:50,449
girl like took pity on me and she with I

00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:52,760
remember her coming up to me and be like

00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:54,320
Tracy we are your friends

00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,420
and I'm like no you're not which is

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,190
weird to respond to like whisper on Liv

00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,350
and she's like no really where your

00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,060
friends like stop stop doing whatever

00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,380
you're doing and you know that little

00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,320
fantasy as kids do as they're walking

00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,970
together and you always think yourself

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,920
oh I stopped everyone just gonna keep on

00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,810
walking and no one's you know they don't

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,760
even knows I'm there and I would do that

00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:16,459
multiple times and they would always

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:21,829
turn around be like ah Tracy come on

00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:24,529
what are you doing so like six months of

00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:26,329
giving up six months of this this one

00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:29,329
girl deciding to make me her project and

00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:32,870
to reintroduce me into having friends

00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:35,150
but the this mental feeling about people

00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:37,370
about this trust of strangers is like

00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:39,350
this how hard it is to make friends of

00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:41,120
getting into groups and being completely

00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:43,250
scared and just shutting down this is

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,550
something I still struggle with to this

00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:50,240
day I high school was better for me I

00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:52,430
well at the end of that 12th 12 years

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,630
old into the my seventh grade I told my

00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:55,230
parents I was not gonna move anymore

00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:57,180
which is a really shitty thing

00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,710
a kid to have to do to tell their mom

00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,760
with her dad like tell your mom I'm not

00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:03,540
gonna live with you anymore and live

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,700
with my dad it was rough but as soon as

00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,620
I stopped moving I went from a D student

00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,880
to an A student I started to get friends

00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,070
in high school I was with the misfits

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,900
listen to tool we played dungeons

00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:16,010
dragons high school was actually a

00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:24,540
really cool time for me but moving

00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:25,770
moving to moving to university leaving

00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,620
all this group of people that I

00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:30,840
collected these people I felt safe with

00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:33,300
University my first year was I've just

00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,430
wait right back to my 12 year old self I

00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,380
went back to not trusting people not

00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:40,260
making friends and yeah another year

00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:43,200
went with me not really making friends I

00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:46,380
made one friends that year on my dorm

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,820
room like my next-door neighbor and we

00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,620
ended up living together the second year

00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,360
and a second year I started making my

00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,580
friends in my own and she came up to me

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,020
and - I was going out for like the first

00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:57,810
time and she's like crazy

00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:59,430
you made friends and she's like so happy

00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,410
for me because he knew how hard it was

00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:07,500
for me to like go out there and like

00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:08,220
meet people so these issues were already

00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,530
in my head

00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:14,280
stuck in my head these this distress of

00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:17,280
other people another I got walloped by

00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,050
another life event in this time like I

00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,510
said my mom was a alcoholic with

00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:23,670
substance issues and the alcoholism was

00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:25,620
slowly killing her during this time in

00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,270
high school it was you know she'd be in

00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,370
hospital every now and then in

00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:32,580
university she was in the hospital a lot

00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:34,620
more than just every now and then so my

00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:36,630
my times and university was constantly

00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,860
going up and mom's in the hospital again

00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:41,130
we found out from the neighbors that she

00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:43,550
was taken away in an ambulance and it

00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:47,610
was you know brought to say the least

00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:50,880
and then my dad my wonderful wonderful

00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:52,320
dad had originally diagnosed with

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,730
melanoma in high school and I didn't

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,690
know what that meant and never really

00:13:53,730 --> 00:14:01,530
paid attention and when I was 21 he was

00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:02,610
the Rinda melanoma I came back and I'm

00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:06,090
always still alive at this point this is

00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:08,230
not my mom is my stepmom I was 21 he was

00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:12,040
like no reigniting I was with melanoma

00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:15,370
in May and he died a September this is

00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:19,210
actually this is actually five days

00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:20,530
before he died it was on his birthday my

00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,750
birthday is there a tenth his birthday

00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:24,310
after eighth so we got together for my

00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,290
birthday

00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:27,940
and it was all like oh you're beating

00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,200
the cancer it's awesome like well I'm

00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:32,020
gonna have her birthday together like we

00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:34,500
usually do and the next day it just went

00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:38,290
downhill and he died on September 13th

00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:40,690
and my mom was still alive but not

00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,460
barely so and then the next year and a

00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,440
half a year and a half later we became

00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:46,150
estranged I stopped talking to her I

00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:51,880
didn't see her for six months before she

00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:56,130
died so I was 22 and the years of 22 to

00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:58,990
25 I was in and out of deep depression i

00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:00,990
the social anxiety issues transformed

00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:03,130
into panic attacks to the point of where

00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,540
when a panic attack would happen I would

00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,520
actually start physically hurting myself

00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:09,640
because when your emotional pain is so

00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:11,620
great what what can you do then cause

00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:14,830
physical pain to distract yourself from

00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:17,350
emotional pain dug myself into this

00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:19,060
really really deep hole and it's really

00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:23,290
strange looking to myself now at 32

00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:25,090
turning 33 in a month that less than ten

00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:28,390
years ago I was a completely different

00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:29,680
person I had so many promise these

00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:32,800
problems of talking to people his

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,560
problems of being social problems of

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,090
having confidence in myself this deep

00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,790
hole out that I was in and then I had to

00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:41,440
slowly start like climbing out of

00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:45,250
because I still knew that I liked to

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:49,690
build things I wanted to to build things

00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:51,700
for other people to use and this process

00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:54,880
I knew I needed to get out of that hole

00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:58,630
in order to to be up here to be giving a

00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,190
keynote so I know these all these like

00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,840
tips I give you where I'm just like oh

00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:07,330
alert you know go out and do these

00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:10,690
things I know how hard it is I know how

00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:11,860
hard it is you know this is the things

00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:14,590

being an advocate for yourself like

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,889
having to take life by the reins and and

00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:41,310
jump off that cliff and do things that

00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:42,689
are scary these are the things I these

00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,670
are like the top tips that I've learned

00:16:42,689 --> 00:16:47,490
over the last few years that have helped

00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:51,779
me go from that person when I wasn't for

00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:52,829
to now waiver advice is not

00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:54,720
one-size-fits-all

00:16:52,829 --> 00:16:56,550
the things that I mentioned here like

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,069
are not gonna apply unilaterally to

00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:00,990
everyone in this audience my goal is

00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:02,939
that there's only one thing there like I

00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:05,429
can use that one thing to improve my

00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:07,049
life or career so fYI if this isn't

00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:08,400
apply to you I totally understand it's

00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:10,380
me this is things I worked out for my

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:15,630
life I really hope that at least one

00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:21,049
thing works out for you alright tip

00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:21,049
number one the worst they can say is now

00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:28,500
let's talk about the scariest moment my

00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:31,169
career I in University I started working

00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,789
at a startup and it was like it wasn't

00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:34,409
like oh I started to approach me like oh

00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:35,789
we were certain it was like guys in the

00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:38,130
garage and they're like hey or building

00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:40,679
this website we need a designer do you

00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,970
wanna come work with us I'm like sure so

00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:44,220
I went on that website I start hacking

00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:46,440
down to that garage and started hacking

00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:50,610
together which is pretty cool like legit

00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,590
startup and this this was really fun we

00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:54,120
went from the garage I graduated

00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,340
University and they moved up to the Bay

00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,590
Area turn into you know from this like

00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,409
bunch of dudes in the garage to like an

00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:03,150
actual company in the Bay Area and I

00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:04,650
started working with them full-time as a

00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,110
designer and it ended up working them

00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:08,850
for about four and a half years I know

00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,530
it was just like these are my friends

00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,510
like these are people like we're gonna

00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:15,240
build this website this collection of

00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:18,710
websites it was an online education lead

00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:21,240
gen company which is kind of weird if I

00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:22,740
not be like the sexiest thing to be in

00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,740
but it was really cool to meet these

00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,480
bunch of these guys and we're like we're

00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,549
gonna work on this together build it up

00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,530
look how far we have come we're all

00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:35,120
gonna be walking away or this from this

00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:35,120
with buckets of money

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,130
so yeah I worked them for like four and

00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:47,270
a half years in total around the fourth

00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:47,270
year I met my future husband uh-huh and

00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:52,260
he kind of changed my life in funny ways

00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:54,690
you know not just the obvious like oh

00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:58,770
yeah we got married tie plays so we

00:18:54,690 --> 00:19:00,630
started we like if anyone knows Andre so

00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,130
Andre is the author of your lip three

00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,170
he's a Python her as well

00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:07,230
here look three is used in requests and

00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:09,630
pip and all that kind of stuff so Andre

00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,160
when I first met if you know him this is

00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:13,530
very typical for him somehow in our

00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:16,170
first dates he wiggled out of me that

00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,610
like what I was doing what my job was

00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,050
and how much I was being paid which is a

00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:21,510
really weird thing to be talking about

00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:25,980
on your first days but this is totally

00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:28,440
normal for Andre and he was like you are

00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,630
being underpaid I was I originally

00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,790
started this job at 40k a year because

00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,680
you know Hoover start up you know 40k

00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,270
like this is all we can do and then

00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,820
every year it might review they'd always

00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:40,680
be like oh you know you're awesome 10%

00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,660
raise like this is the max we can do and

00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,700
you got it and I'm like yeah I'm awesome

00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,130
so I think when I met him I was at

00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,600
53,000 and I was just like yeah I'm

00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:50,880
making 53 and he's like you were being

00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,040
underpaid I'm like no I'm not it's like

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,750
yes you are and I'm like it's a startup

00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,820
and he's like it doesn't matter and I'm

00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:59,130
like they can't afford more he's like

00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,990
I'm sure of course they can and then I

00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:03,510
had like litany like all these excuses

00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:05,940
and so our dating kind of turned into

00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:08,190
media for coffee and we'd walk around

00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,390
the suburbs behind the coffee shop and I

00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:12,390
would just give him all the excuses

00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:14,460
about why I shouldn't ask for a raise

00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:17,409
and he just refute every single of them

00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:22,279
yeah true love right

00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:24,169
and somehow over this time he he broke

00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:26,600
down all of my excuses about why I

00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:30,309
shouldn't ask for a raise why I was

00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:33,500
actually not I was being legit underpaid

00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:36,350
and he convinced me I needed to go high

00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,779
53 my yearly review was coming up very

00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:40,100
soon it's at 53 thousand and he

00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:43,669
convinced me I need to go in there and

00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:47,000
ask for a raise to 90,000 that is a

00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:48,799
gigantic jump and I like still to this

00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,940
day I have no idea how he convinced me

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,549
to actually ask for that because I think

00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:55,940
that's so scary for me now to go that

00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:58,520
amount that amount of money so I went

00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,110
into that interview and just like

00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:03,559
shaking if I do it's like I am just like

00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:05,539
oh this is I I'm gonna get fired like I

00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:09,649
am breaking all the rules that are set

00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:14,179
by you know companies for employees and

00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:16,130
of course I in that in that review they

00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:18,169
were like the same thing before Tracy

00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:20,570
10% raise you're awesome like

00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:26,390
congratulations you can leave now and I

00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:29,809
was like well like I did some research

00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:31,640
and I think I'm actually worth I think

00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:34,100
the race was going to be to like 60,000

00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:37,700
or psyche that I was like I should be be

00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:38,870
paid 85 now notice that 85 not 90 the

00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,309
number he convinced me and I went back

00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:44,260
to Andre afterwards and I was like oh I

00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:44,260
said 85 he was like I knew you would

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:52,560
that's why I said 90 if you were gonna

00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:57,990
cut your thumb this is this is Andre

00:21:52,560 --> 00:22:00,720
this is so him so I said 85 and my

00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:01,680
bosses two faces with white and they're

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,960
like you need to leave now

00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,520
like not quit like not your mo isn't

00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,600
fired just yet but they're like you need

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,980
to leave this office and we need to

00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,420
deliberate about this and so I went back

00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:14,970
to my desk and I'm just like oh my god

00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:17,490
like I am so fired and not like less

00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:20,330
than a half an hour later they called me

00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:26,220
back into their office and I said well

00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:28,620
we can't do 85 we can do 82 what is like

00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:30,240
they're gonna offer me 60 and then it

00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:38,180
went up to 82 and I'm just like of

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:38,180
course I took it 55% raised Wow

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:56,169
listen hour later I started doing this

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:58,870
house wait that was too easy they knew

00:22:56,169 --> 00:23:01,059
they were under paying me that's why huh

00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:03,700
that's why it was so easy to get that

00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:07,480
raise they knew that their under paying

00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:09,760
me and there was no reason for them to

00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:13,000
ever pay me a market salary even though

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:15,610
they obviously could until I asked for

00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,700
it this was like a nuclear explosion in

00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:21,010
my brain like my whole world turned

00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,870
upside down learned a very valuable

00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:24,700
lesson about working in a company is

00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:26,260
that there was no reason to pay me more

00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:29,620
unless I asked for it and things like

00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:32,919
the max 10% raise are just there by

00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:34,510
accompany to you know stop you for

00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:36,730
asking for more prevent you from asking

00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:39,610
for and thank goodness that Andrey came

00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:41,350
along and helped me out with that this

00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:44,100
was such a transformative time in my

00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:49,390
career to realize that it was up to me

00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:50,799
to know what I'm worth it was up to me I

00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:52,450
couldn't rely on this company these

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,529
friends I was working with his buckets

00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:56,860
of money they were all promised each

00:23:53,529 --> 00:24:01,200
other I couldn't rely on other people to

00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:01,200
to know what I was worth and pay me that

00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:07,120
it taught me that I need to ask for it

00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:08,590
and this is super scary like I I have

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,020
much rather just be working my company

00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:12,610
know that I was being taken care of but

00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,320
you can't trust on that and I understand

00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:16,090
as a business person I run wedding

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,130
lovely I have full-time employees under

00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:19,450
me I totally understand the whole like

00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:21,070
oh crap I hope they don't ask for a

00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:24,190
raise because you know the company is

00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:25,450
stretched really thin I understand it

00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:27,940
from a business perspective too I know

00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:29,919
why they did that but it taught me that

00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:36,370
as an employee I also had to be in

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:38,169
charge of myself so how do you know how

00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:40,960
much you're worth how do you know to

00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:42,190

should I negotiate spoiler always

00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:12,710
negotiate like this is a very easy

00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,690
question to respond to like even if it's

00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,880
that your initial offer is awesome it's

00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:18,289
just a little ask for a little more and

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,730
that's what the people have said in this

00:26:18,289 --> 00:26:21,799
email list they were able to help out

00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:24,440
this person and give them the advice

00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:26,299
that they needed to take that step that

00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:30,190
would potentially affect their career

00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:30,190
for pretty much of that press their life

00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:34,159
terms of knowing how much you're worth

00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:36,830
obviously look at salary aggregators and

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,590
you know there's things like salary calm

00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:41,390
pay scale calm glassdoor.com I wish I

00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:43,130
did that when I was at this company and

00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:44,840
I would have realized how underpaid I

00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:46,309
was I mean it still I would have still

00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,900
had those other excuses like over

00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:49,400
certain oh we can't afford it that

00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,799
required another person to be like oh

00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,510
yeah they can but it would have been

00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:56,900
good at least know what other people

00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:58,250
were in paid and there's actually this

00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,679
was a couple years ago this got really

00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:02,360
big died down since then but it's still

00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:05,090
happening people on Twitter and other

00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:10,549
social media networks talking okay

00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:12,049
King salaries the talk pay hashtag and

00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:13,789
fYI you can talk to your co-workers

00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:16,460
about salary if you're under the

00:27:13,789 --> 00:27:18,230
impression that it is illegal or against

00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,669
the rules or it's you know it's in your

00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,470
employee handbook where it says hey you

00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:21,830
can't talk to your co-workers about your

00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:24,830
salary

00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:27,590
all those are just things made up by the

00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:28,999
company to prevent you from talking to

00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:31,399
each other and then asking for more

00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:33,230
there it's not illegal

00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:36,379
you totally can talk and you should talk

00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:40,549
talk to your co-workers make sure on

00:27:36,379 --> 00:27:41,929
even footing and don't wait and see

00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:43,490
you're unhappy to become informed like

00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:47,240
you could be like I'm when I was on that

00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:50,440
company I was totally happy and like I

00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:52,600
would have just continued on as I was

00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,340
until this other person let me know

00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,559
where I actually was it was positioned

00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,509
so it's worth even if you're happy of

00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:01,309
where you are you know do some research

00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:03,369
make sure that you're you are indeed

00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:06,110
being paid and then you were able to ask

00:28:03,369 --> 00:28:10,009
that asking part is the hard part

00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:12,919
I found this yesterday and immediately

00:28:10,009 --> 00:28:16,429
put it into this so what you do if

00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:20,919
you're in a yeah right what you do if

00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:20,919
you're in a job interview

00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:34,529
[Laughter]

00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:36,179
throat sucks number B point one always

00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:43,919
be beeping yeah

00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:45,389
get real poofy there's a couple books

00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,009
that really did change my life during

00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:48,269
this time as well I know this is a

00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:49,710
controversial book I know there's a lot

00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:52,980
of people out here don't like this book

00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:54,360
I loved it if you haven't read it I

00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,409
encourage you to read it make your own

00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,059
decision

00:28:55,409 --> 00:29:00,929
I think llenan is a really really good

00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:04,409
book and it it helped me take those like

00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:07,799
take those steps of reading in and then

00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:10,289
asking and now making doing negotiation

00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:12,090
or figuring out where I was in terms of

00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:15,090
my career in salary and me and being

00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:17,580
able myself to make those changes I

00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:19,679
totally believe that some we can you

00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:22,080
know as women try to change the world in

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,399
terms of how we how it is like the

00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,249
culture changed the culture together

00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:28,139
while also being advocates for ourselves

00:29:26,249 --> 00:29:29,909
and this book is a really great but for

00:29:28,139 --> 00:29:34,259
helping your helping you learn to be an

00:29:29,909 --> 00:29:35,820
advocate for yourself and this book is

00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:38,009
magical if you have not read this book

00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:40,379
you should read it it is great it is

00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:42,809
well written is a great story and has

00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:46,080
such great lessons art of asking by

00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:50,700
Amanda Palmer or how I stopped worrying

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:52,200
and let people help you know when you

00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,960
have this support now we're building the

00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:57,419
support network and people you know who

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,369
are there to help you you have to let

00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:03,450
them help you and that sometimes can be

00:29:59,369 --> 00:30:05,610
a really really hard thing to do when it

00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:07,740
comes to feeling confident enough to ask

00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:09,869
for things for taking that step of

00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,730
putting myself out there and asking for

00:30:09,869 --> 00:30:13,740
something I need something that's hope

00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:15,779
this practice asking for small things

00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,820
and you know there's a lot of like weird

00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:20,700
marketers out there who who talk about

00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:21,840
this like asking for I don't you know

00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,119
I'm talking about people who like kind

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,499
of break the rules and they'll like try

00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:27,929
to get something that benefits them but

00:30:25,499 --> 00:30:29,879
like hurts I thinking of Tim Ferriss and

00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:31,769
the sue Mercado some Tim Ferriss things

00:30:29,879 --> 00:30:33,299
you might know I'm talking about like

00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:35,070
yeah you can totally like take the world

00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:37,649
and then they're kind of being scumbags

00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:39,779
don't be evil I tried to when I try to

00:30:37,649 --> 00:30:41,250
find small things to ask for in my

00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:44,370
day-to-day life I try to find things

00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:48,360
that benefit me as well as a person

00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:52,230
whom I am asking for example airplanes

00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:53,429
oh I take a lot of flights I spoke at 17

00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:55,590
conferences last year which is pretty

00:30:53,429 --> 00:30:59,429
baller and so therefore I was on a plane

00:30:55,590 --> 00:31:01,140
a plane a lot about one-tenth of the

00:30:59,429 --> 00:31:05,010
planes I have on I'm actually not on the

00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:07,080
plane that I booked because I say you're

00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:09,150
here and your plane is leaving at like

00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,130
5:00 p.m. and the hotel is kicking you

00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:12,840
out at 11:00 so you just go to the

00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:14,700
airport with your computer you're like

00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,770
I'll just work until my plane takes off

00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,840
and get to the airport and there's

00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:19,919
another flight going to your destination

00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,929
leaving earlier in the day and you

00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,340
probably saw it when you're booking the

00:31:21,929 --> 00:31:24,480
flights and it was probably more

00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,130
expensive which is why you booked the

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,370
later one but now you're at the airport

00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:31,559
there's a flight leaving earlier walk up

00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:35,159
to the desk and ask if they can put you

00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:37,529
on my flight it works all the time oh my

00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:40,020
gosh seriously do this it's in it like

00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:41,669
the airline's incentive to put you on

00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,200
earlier flight if they have room because

00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:45,450
that means the later flight yeah

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,649
something could go wrong they want to

00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:48,809
have more seats in that later flight

00:31:46,649 --> 00:31:51,559
just in case like it doesn't hurt them

00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:54,510
really to put you on that earlier flight

00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:55,919
and of course it benefits me because now

00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,539
I'm in an earlier flight going home way

00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,770
earlier on a flight that's probably more

00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:01,260
expensive the book but I don't have to

00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:02,909
pay more like some like some of the big

00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:05,130
carriers America and Delta United

00:32:02,909 --> 00:32:07,590
sometimes will ask you to pay an extra

00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:10,049
change fee and about 50% of the time

00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:11,399
I'll like oh yeah okay a change fee

00:32:10,049 --> 00:32:13,140
alright I'll do it

00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:15,809
about 50% of time they like and waive

00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:18,600
that for you it's totally worth asking

00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:19,830
is a really cool you know if you're

00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,990
traveling a lot and you see that

00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:23,190
opportunity you can ask and see if

00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:27,059
they'll move you to that or fly and the

00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:28,559
worst thing they can say is no so that's

00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:30,779
one of the ways that's something I I

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,130
practice doing whatever I'm flying and I

00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:36,899
try to look for other opportunities for

00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:39,330
me to I mean really like promote myself

00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:41,640
like take advantage of the system but in

00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:43,890
a way I can ask for ways I'll improve my

00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,299
life that also you know works out in the

00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:49,320
other person's favor look for those

00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:52,440
opportunities the other thing that helps

00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:56,549
me with asking with asking for things

00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:58,050
that that will benefit me and I'll think

00:32:56,549 --> 00:33:00,540
about what's the worst case

00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:01,770
Aereo you have to think about this

00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,720
logically because the worst case

00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:05,370
scenario could be a meteor is gonna fall

00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,840
from the sky and then it's gonna smoosh

00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:08,790
me and then the world's gonna explode

00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:11,970
any like you can go really far with the

00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:14,460
worst case scenario dial it back think

00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:17,910
logically what's the actual worst case

00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:20,250
scenario back to the whole salary

00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:24,660
negotiation thing the way I look at it

00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:27,510
started negotiation is that there is

00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:29,460
about a 25% chance I mean you know these

00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:31,860
are all guesses but this is how I really

00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:34,770
like I really think this is pretty

00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:36,720
accurate my feelings are as they're

00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:39,750
about 25% chance of them just being like

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,280
sure you know one in four chance does

00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:44,910
that mean like okay cool we can do that

00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:46,860
number there's a larger chance there's a

00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:48,540
50% chance that they'll negotiate back

00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:50,280
they'll say let's meet em you know like

00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:52,500
that company did me they don't want to

00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:54,030
say they want just like the people I was

00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,620
to work with are like master negotiator

00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:57,210
so of course I'll never take my offer

00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:00,540
they always try to like save Farias by

00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:01,560
like cutting me down and like 52 or 82

00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,510
okay

00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:06,570
like people are usually gonna meet you

00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:10,320
in the middle but I believes like like a

00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:11,100
3/4 75% chance of getting a better offer

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,560
than we had before

00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:15,450
so I'm like that's a risk I totally can

00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:18,570
take 75 chance percent chance of getting

00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:20,550
a higher offer but of course there's

00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:24,020
some negatives there's like say a one in

00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:26,250
five chance of that missing no saying go

00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:29,910
which puts you right back to where you

00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:33,690
were before so you know that's a what

00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:36,690
ninety percent chance of either making a

00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:38,910
higher salary or nothing happening and

00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:41,310
then there's the worst-case scenario

00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,960
like what what is the worst case when it

00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:44,850
comes to a job offer or a salary offer

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,120
and the worst case could be they're like

00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:49,169
no and we're taking offer away like it's

00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,700
it's scary

00:34:49,169 --> 00:34:52,470
if someone says okay I'm offering this

00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:54,450
job for 50,000 you're like actually

00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:55,440
fifty five you know there's a chance

00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:57,630
that it's like you know what we don't

00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,890
want to work with you anymore and that's

00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,480
really scary you don't want that job

00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:02,220
offer to go away and that's what stops a

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,860
lot of people from taking that step in

00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:08,430
negotiation so the thing that reassures

00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:10,080
me in that case is what I really want to

00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:11,440
work for companies that attitude it'd be

00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,940
better to suss that out

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,930
they had that attitude about money

00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:18,670
earlier on than later so that's kind of

00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:22,390
how I look at things in life in general

00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:23,859
I try to really think about what are the

00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:25,030
chances of something going right for me

00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:25,420
whether the chances of something going

00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:28,150
wrong

00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:31,089
what's that worst case scenario and if

00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:32,760
that worst case scenario happened how

00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:35,260
would I react to it

00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,780
so with say yeah sorry negotiation it's

00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:40,119
all positives it's either gonna be a no

00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,859
a yes and if it's a horse

00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:43,270
her if o'clock response I get worsen the

00:35:41,859 --> 00:35:45,940
offer I don't want to work with them

00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:48,849
anyways it's like reassures me reassures

00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:52,619
me and helps me take that really scary

00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:52,619
step of asking for more money

00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:58,540
some general negotiation / asking tips

00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:00,940
really quickly if you're negotiating

00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:02,530
money this works for our salaries this

00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:04,510
works if you have a company and you're

00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:06,940
raising money try not to give the first

00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:09,010
number yourself now look at the person

00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:10,510
do the number resist the urge they're

00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:12,280
like oh what were you making your last

00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:14,170
job I feel like I don't think that's

00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,970
relevant or something you know try not

00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:17,290
to give that number they're trying to

00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:18,790
get you to say your number so they can

00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:20,710
be like hey we can give you a five

00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:22,150
percent boost whereas if you didn't give

00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:27,520
a number they might have given you a ten

00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:29,230
fifteen percent and in any asking

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:33,250
situation when you're asking for money

00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:36,040
the fundraising asking do these switch

00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:38,140
planes how to switch planes don't

00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:42,490
undercut yourself keep the request brief

00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:44,079
I have a tendency to babble I try not to

00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:45,609
do that alright just like you're asking

00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,880
for you know earlier flight you're like

00:36:45,609 --> 00:36:50,530
I I see there's a slight open and I have

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,240
an important thing at home in this

00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,530
meeting I need to get to and so I was

00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,119
like kind of hoping that you can move me

00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:56,619
to this earlier flight because that

00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,150
would be really awesome and help my cat

00:36:56,619 --> 00:37:01,329
or something that you know you just like

00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:04,329
keep going it's much better just be like

00:37:01,329 --> 00:37:05,619
I see there's a flight available is

00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:06,700
there I'm on the later flight is there

00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:12,190
any way I can be on this earlier flight

00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:14,710
and stop or you know thank you for your

00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:20,020
offer of 80,000 I think I'm worth 85

00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:21,640
stop like don't babble I can go on for

00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,400
ages about this ask me more violent more

00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:26,530
about it later

00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:29,950
in general negotiation does not mean

00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:32,800
you're a mean person or selfish you're

00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:36,310
just asking for something better and

00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:40,900
this this reassures me when I need to to

00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:43,660
take that step and ask for more this is

00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,920
why I love Jay Cooke on that support

00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:47,380
network the people out there that can

00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,089
help you make these ask or you know tell

00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:51,730
you where you are and you know terms of

00:37:49,089 --> 00:37:54,790
salary or career this is such a great

00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:57,160
place to meet other people that leads me

00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:59,380
into my next big tip because if you're

00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,599
someone with anxiety or social anxiety

00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:03,310
or me you know walk into a room of

00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,930
strangers and your brain is yelling at

00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:08,170
you like these people are my enemies and

00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:10,210
they all hate me like if you're like me

00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:15,190
it's really really scary to come into a

00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:19,180
place like this I an ex-pro tip is to

00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:20,440
make one one meaningful connection at

00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:24,760
events you don't have to meet everybody

00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:28,240
just make one my very first conference

00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:30,579
ever was soft by Southwest in 2008 this

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:33,040
is deep into my being scared about

00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:35,470
people face and someone had told me

00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,300
someone I could mentor when I was in

00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:38,950
school told me that if I wanted to make

00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,260
it into tech I needed to go to South by

00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:43,240
Southwest and I went to this job this

00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:45,490
job that I you know the whole story

00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,780
about money was from and none of them

00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,069
were really interested in going out and

00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,420
meeting other people I asked then I'm

00:38:48,069 --> 00:38:52,270
like oh there's this conference and like

00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:54,520
we're not doing that and I took the

00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:57,190
really scary step hellooo I took the

00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:58,990
really scary step of deciding to take

00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:01,210
that person's advice bought the plane

00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:04,829
ticket bought the hotel room and I flew

00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:07,960
South by Southwest knowing no one and

00:39:04,829 --> 00:39:10,780
that first conference was largely me

00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:12,670
walking into like an after-party seeing

00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:15,280
everyone in little groups talking to

00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:17,140
each other going back and then running

00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,330
away

00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:22,099
I was like everyone is talking to each

00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:23,810
other I can't like jump into those

00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:25,280
groups ever like everyone has their

00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:27,920
friends and I'm here on my own and it's

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,990
oh I just sit in my hotel room on the

00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,040
plane back I go into the sessions I

00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:32,869
still had a good time I was like oh

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:36,170
that's cool that was largely alone for

00:39:32,869 --> 00:39:37,280
the entire event on the plane back found

00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:38,599
some people who were at South by

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,040
Southwest you know and we're going back

00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:44,330
to the same area which is kind of cool

00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:47,330
and we got to talking I have became

00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:48,369
friends on the plane and those people in

00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:51,560
the Bay Area

00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:54,440
like from then I met more people and

00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:56,599
then I met more people and it's like a

00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,490
direct line from those people in that

00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:00,650
plane to where I am right now in my

00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:02,810
career like just person to person to

00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:07,190
person to event to event event like

00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:11,840
meeting those people just like changed

00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:14,090
my career I still have anxiety advanced

00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:17,210
and there's a few things that I use

00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:20,270
nowadays to help me you know walk into

00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:22,070
that crowded after-party room where I

00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:24,410
was talking to each other and go out and

00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:25,609
try to make that connection and see if

00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:30,109
there's that person in there that's

00:40:25,609 --> 00:40:31,400
gonna change my career in my life this

00:40:30,109 --> 00:40:33,500
is what I did earlier on I haven't done

00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:37,910
this in a few years earlier on Aundre

00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:40,010
same dude I talked about before we would

00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:41,420
go to a lot of events in the Bay Area a

00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:44,750
lot of tech events that were there and

00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:46,550
we would we kind of turned into a game

00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:47,960
so instead of walking to a room being

00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:50,900
like okay now I need to go mingle

00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:53,420
for you know thirty minutes and you

00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:55,160
don't really have a purpose we didn't

00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:56,480
have like rules there wasn't like any

00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,770
like you have to talk to this many

00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,990
people there was nothing like set in

00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:01,760
stone but the agreement was is that we

00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,990
would split up no I think not be with

00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,230
each other because sometimes that's kind

00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:08,050
of like you know hand-holding holding me

00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:11,390
back with meeting people we had split up

00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:12,800
talk to people and then we came back we

00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:15,800
had to tell each other like who we met

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,660
and why they were cool and changing it

00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,339
from this like weird meaningless

00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:20,599
activity of like walking to room and

00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:22,010
just trying to chat people for a half an

00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:24,920
hour before you can leave turning that

00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:26,540
from that to okay I need to go meet

00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,560
someone and then

00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,640
because I'm gonna have to report back to

00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,990
Andre and then we're gonna split up

00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,150
again and go meet my other person then

00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:34,370
come back together it just switched

00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:35,600
something in my brain it made it easier

00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:37,550
for me to just walk up to people I'll be

00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:39,080
like hey I'm Tracy nice to meet you

00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:40,310
because I had to do that like it was

00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:43,520
more of a game instead of just this

00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:45,950
weird like social activity and it really

00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,510
helped me like get the confidence to

00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:48,800
start breaking into groups of people and

00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:55,040
just like saying my name and meeting

00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:57,860
them and this is what I do nowadays this

00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,050
is like this social anxiety I was at PHP

00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:01,640
Tech earlier this year and I've been

00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:04,130
doing all these conferences I think I've

00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:06,740
come so far in my life and PHP I don't

00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:08,060
know PHP it was a completely new

00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,560
environment for me it didn't have any

00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,970
friends there and I did that thing where

00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,320
I walked into the after party and I was

00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:14,240
like oh my god there's all those

00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:17,930
feelings again they're not they haven't

00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:20,120
gone away in that case I do nowadays is

00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:21,890
I again instead of just meaningless

00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,570
activity of going into a room of people

00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:26,480
and trying to meet people and not having

00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:29,360
a purpose I tell myself that I cannot

00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,640
leave until I've made one meaningful

00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:33,620
connection like it's not just like me

00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:36,560
five people or just like talk to five

00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:38,000
people like in one meaningful connection

00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,170
might sound a little scary so you might

00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,680
be like oh I could talk to like ten

00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:44,510
people and they can all suck but I find

00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,700
that just one person and it's actually

00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:48,140
easier when I do it it's actually easier

00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:50,120
to meet someone where I'm like oh I'm

00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:51,650
glad I met that person and then I'm like

00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:55,490
cool I could leave now I made that one

00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:57,080
connection but it's like changed events

00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:58,550
for me it's made it so I continue to

00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:01,490
network even when I'm feeling scared

00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:04,910
when I you know give networking events a

00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:06,200
little bit more purpose the other thing

00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:09,980
the last thing that really helps me out

00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:12,440
with events is I really it's really hard

00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:15,440
nowadays I really try to tell myself

00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:17,450
that 99% of people are awesome now

00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,790
that's a really big number you might be

00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:20,870
like I looked at Twitter today and it's

00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:24,050
pretty obvious

00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:26,550
[Laughter]

00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:30,300
like 1% of people is actually pretty

00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:31,800
pretty big number number it took me

00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,120
forever on the plane to draw even it was

00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,990
just happy faces and the person next me

00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:40,320
was like what is she doing but you know

00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:41,550
there's like say 350 people here I think

00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,290
that's how many people are doing a coin

00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:46,940
that leaves like three and a half people

00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:50,730
who suck you know I'm sorry that's you

00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:54,480
let me know but that also leaves like

00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:55,830
over 300 people who are awesome and when

00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,180
I look at Twitter and there's people I

00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:59,880
know that social media amplifies

00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,750
negative horrible people I just try to

00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,760
tell myself that they are being

00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:06,000
amplified and that the vast majority of

00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:08,520
people in the world are people just

00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,410
trying to make their way that are nice

00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,090
people they don't have to agree with me

00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:15,600
we can have completely different values

00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:19,080
but they can still be a what I say an

00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:21,450
awesome person it makes it easier for me

00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:22,830
to be around people it makes events less

00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,930
scary I have to really really

00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:27,390
internalize this that people are going

00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:29,850
to be more good than bad you know

00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:32,990
because I'm fighting against that brain

00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:35,880
instinct that people will hate me

00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:39,120
non-tech ways there's been a really big

00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:42,000
non tech way that helped me like renew

00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:47,220
my faith in people I do a lot of

00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:49,550
outdoorsy hello dad speaker turn your

00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,550
phone off

00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:55,300
all right that's on silent now all right

00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:57,700
I do a lot of outdoorsy events um a

00:44:55,300 --> 00:45:00,550
couple few years ago I took I decided to

00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:02,770
uh hey run away from tech okay at that

00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:05,650
second run away from tech and do the

00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:07,930
John Muir Trail in California 200

00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:09,340
something miles and did it by myself

00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:11,110
because I couldn't figure out fine

00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,220
anyone else who was willing to go run

00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:14,590
around for three weeks in the wilderness

00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:16,300
with me and I was like that's not gonna

00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:18,160
stop me I really got to get away from

00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:20,920
the computer so I'm just gonna go do

00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:23,680
this hike and it's a lot of people are

00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:26,980
like whoa you did that on your own you

00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:29,380
did that on your own as a woman like

00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:31,630
wasn't that scary yeah you look at

00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:35,110
that's the movie wild yes I've seen it

00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:37,090
I've seen the movie wild I've read the

00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:40,840
book it kind of drives me nuts I

00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:42,370
actually do not like the book it made I

00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:44,410
feel like there yeah yeah you talked to

00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:47,020
me about it later I had a great

00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:49,060
experience people on the trail became my

00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:51,340
family people found out that I was on my

00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:52,540
own and without me asking people were

00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:55,660
trying to take care of me people are

00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:59,800
checking up on me I felt so safe on this

00:45:55,660 --> 00:46:01,240
trip it was amazing these are some

00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,570
people I met on the trail when I was

00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:05,230
there

00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:06,430
these were my besties you know this is

00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:08,590
two weeks into it which is kind of cool

00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:10,540
I think the thing with backpacking is

00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:12,220
that you say you're at a restaurant here

00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:13,720
and you see people good people the table

00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:15,370
you can't just like sit down next to

00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:16,750
them and be like hey I'm Tracy they'd be

00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:20,380
like what are you doing why are you at

00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:21,970
my seat but with backpacking you were on

00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:23,830
like a long trip like this Pacific Crest

00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:24,880
Trail anything you walk into a

00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:26,290
restaurant you see a group of

00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,700
backpackers all sitting around a table

00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:28,840
and you can tell who they are

00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:32,320
cuz they're the ones who are really

00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:34,540
dirty and stinky and you can just like

00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:36,310
walk up to them sit down being dirty and

00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:38,860
sneaky yourself and be like hi I'm Tracy

00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:40,930
oh yeah how's it going he just like make

00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:42,280
new friends and that's like that's why I

00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:44,590
did the entire trail I was a sailor

00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:46,180
first I just like went from table to

00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:48,340
table meeting people walk to people

00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:51,400
somedays can't to people other days and

00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:54,190
like got Laura like really got over that

00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:56,710
fear of just like meeting strangers and

00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:57,790
then trusting them and then backpacking

00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:59,250
road was a little bit different than the

00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:01,810
real world cuz again you can't do that

00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:04,040
really but this is one of the things

00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:07,880
that kind of really helped me

00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:10,610
more outgoing like I said remember that

00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:15,560
social media it makes awful people like

00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:17,390
more common I again I try to tell myself

00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:19,400
that anything awful I see on social

00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:21,200
media there's that 1% of people I don't

00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,580
like and then I can move on my life and

00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,130
try to reassure myself that there's

00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:28,270
still awesome people fighting those off

00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:28,270
people you know what I'm talking about

00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:36,170
and it's also important to get to this

00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:39,320
point to be the support network for

00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:40,580
others you know while finding is

00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,170
supporting our people to help you it's

00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:44,260
important to give back and I don't mean

00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:48,050
that in a completely altruistic way

00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:50,180
selfish secret selfish secrets when you

00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:52,190
help other people if you're helping

00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:53,630
someone with negotiation and you're

00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:56,090
telling them hey you know you should

00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:57,170
don't ever take that first don't take

00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:59,420
that first offer you can always

00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:01,220
negotiate for when I give that advice it

00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:03,950
makes it more likely to take that for me

00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:04,340
to take that advice later like I help

00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:06,380
people

00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:08,750
I totally solve it I help people to help

00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:11,120
myself out in the future it helps remind

00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:13,220
me of the things I need to do you know

00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,600
when someone's buttons on the line when

00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:16,910
it comes to negotiation it's totally

00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:19,130
easy for me to give them the I with the

00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:21,650
advice they need to hear and the more I

00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:25,190
give that advice it is easier for me to

00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:26,960
take it down alive so of course help

00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:28,250
people become a support network for

00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,380
others because that's what you should do

00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:33,560
and be good people and you know help

00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:35,930
each other out but if you also want

00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:38,920
another reason to do so

00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:42,190
remember that helping people to code

00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:45,710
helping people with support questions

00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:50,620
helping someone negotiate a job offer is

00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:50,620
going to improve yourself as well

00:48:52,850 --> 00:49:00,810
last but not least take breaks as needed

00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:03,780
there is this weird like stigma against

00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:06,060
people taking breaks I was talking to

00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:08,340
Kim and you're saying or taking your

00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:10,320
first your first vacation soon after a

00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:11,700
year and I was like hell yes because

00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:15,390
that's what we need to do we need to

00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:17,790
like take you can just run away and take

00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:21,360
a huge break and turn off tech and don't

00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:23,160
worry about people judging you when I

00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,900
did the John Muir Trail is actually in

00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:27,330
the middle of fundraising for my startup

00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:29,700
that's kind of the worst situation to

00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:32,700
run away from tech but also for my

00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:34,260
mental health it's when I really did

00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:38,370
need it right away because oh my god

00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:41,130
fundraising is awful don't so I was like

00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:42,900
I didn't tell anyone I did announce it

00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:45,180
on Twitter I didn't do anything I put

00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:46,800
Andre on my email to respond to me if

00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:48,570
someone was like hey Tracy where are you

00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:53,970
I was like oh I've been here this whole

00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:56,910
time in the meanwhile I'm running around

00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:58,710
the wilderness for three weeks I've done

00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:01,800
this a few times over the last few years

00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:03,960
a year and a half ago I went to a

00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:06,120
surfing retreat for three weeks in Costa

00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:08,100
Rica this makes me look awesome which is

00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:09,810
why I love this photo but believe me

00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:13,140
it's because I all look awesome because

00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:17,160
I'm on land I am the worst surfer in the

00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:18,990
world three weeks was not enough I can

00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,460
look at me look how awesome I look yeah

00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:24,300
there's nothing on me and on a board

00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:26,490
because that doesn't exist this has been

00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:29,190
like key for my life especially as I've

00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:31,290
gone like way far into the whole life I

00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:33,540
had to promote myself world by having a

00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:34,920
certif and writing books and putting

00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:36,480
myself in the situation where I just

00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:38,040
constantly have this self promote and

00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:41,690
work against these like feelings that my

00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:43,590
brain had built up from age 0 to 26

00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:46,920
every now and then I get completely

00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:49,110
overwhelmed and then I turn off all

00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:51,990
electronics and tech and computers and

00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:55,380
not just like a week I run off for like

00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:56,640
three to four weeks I'm lucky I can do

00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,830
that too that's another reason why I

00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:00,500
work for myself

00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:01,910
and even when I do this I'm always

00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:03,800
there's always this voice in my head

00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:05,330
it's like what if someone judges me for

00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,520
walking away like what if someone's like

00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:09,170
Tracy has a book true and why is she

00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,340
just like running around Costa Rica

00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:12,410
surfing when she really should be

00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:14,330
promoting her book but no one does that

00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:19,880
it's just my brain this is my brain

00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:21,980
yelling at me you know and breaks I I do

00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,940
physical activities I really like you

00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:24,980
know running off and doing something

00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:27,020
really physically challenging

00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:28,880
Frakes don't have to be I don't

00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:31,670
recommend everyone to go on the John

00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,560
Muir Trail it could just be stepping

00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:36,470
away from Twitter for a little bit get

00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:38,870
away from negativity and the things that

00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:41,180
are going on especially right now I'm

00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:43,780
just kind of frustrating you can step

00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:47,390
away from tech take the breaks you need

00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:51,170
don't burn yourself out I think we all

00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:53,300
know this but it's still hard to to do

00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:54,680
yourself you know Hey again the selfish

00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,850
secret the more I tell you to take

00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,590
breaks easier it is for me to take

00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:58,790
breaks

00:51:56,590 --> 00:52:01,340
but seriously step away from tech if you

00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:04,370
date a bit don't feel like you have to

00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:05,720
be always on all the time it's really

00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:07,490
important for mental health and this is

00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:15,230
something that's helped me a lot with

00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:20,960
things I do in conclusion you are your

00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:22,550
own best advocate I it's it's awesome if

00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,230
the world comes together and supports

00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:25,880
you and that happens a lot and that's

00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:28,760
why I say I had said people are awesome

00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:31,430
but in the end watch out for your own

00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:33,080
opportunities watch out for things that

00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:34,640
you need to do it's hard to say that you

00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:38,480
have to make that effort especially as

00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:41,380
you know like I said I was shy and had a

00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:43,580
lot of self anxiety to take that step

00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:46,600
but really you are your own best

00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:49,760
advocate take care of yourself first

00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:53,920
we're going to ask ask for what you need

00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,920
and the worst they can say is no

00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:58,040
remember there's more awesome people

00:52:57,050 --> 00:53:00,200
than terrible

00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:02,120
I like you can disagree with me I know a

00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,890
lot people do descri me this is

00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:07,490
something I have to remember in order to

00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:09,150
survive really in this world and I hope

00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:12,089
it helps you I hope I can help

00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:16,130
I truly believe this and I hope that I

00:53:12,089 --> 00:53:16,130
can help you all feel the same way

00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:20,069
build a support network you know you're

00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:22,380
your own best advocate but it's always

00:53:20,069 --> 00:53:24,869
easier to go as a group and to have a

00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:27,630
group around you so build that support

00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:31,589
network ask the people ask for help when

00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:34,170
you need it and be the support network

00:53:31,589 --> 00:53:36,180
be the support network for others again

00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:39,029
it's a good thing to do just in terms of

00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:40,589
our community in our in our world but

00:53:39,029 --> 00:53:47,809
also it's going to help you in the long

00:53:40,589 --> 00:53:50,839
run as well and take breaks as needed

00:53:47,809 --> 00:53:54,390
and I talked about so my backgrounds and

00:53:50,839 --> 00:53:55,529
any of this talk I got one of the few

00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:57,270
delights in life is when someone

00:53:55,529 --> 00:53:59,069
messages me and says hey that helped me

00:53:57,270 --> 00:54:01,049

00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:02,760

00:54:01,049 --> 00:54:05,160
