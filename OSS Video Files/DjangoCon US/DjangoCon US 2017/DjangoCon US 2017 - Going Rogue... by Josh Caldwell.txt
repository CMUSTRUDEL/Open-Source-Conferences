Description: 
	DjangoCon US 2017 - Going Rogue: How Code.org Created a Curriculum Development Platform Without their Engineers All by Josh Caldwell

As a Middle School computer science teacher, I know enough to be dangerous, but not enough to consider myself a “real” developer. As a member of the curriculum team at Code.org (a nonprofit dedicated to providing all students with access to CS education), I knew that our combination of rendered markdown files and Google docs was far from the most effective way to write and deliver curriculum. If only we could schematize our curriculum writing, I thought, we’d be able to write more consistent lessons with better support for teachers to see which lessons are aligned to which standards, or where a given concept was first taught.

When I brought this proposal to our engineering team everyone was excited about the idea, but there was no way we had the bandwidth to actually create it. Our small team of engineers are booked solid building tools for students to learn programming and for teachers to manage their classes. When it comes to the needs of our curriculum writers, we obviously need to come after the students and teachers. But wait, I know how to program. I did the “Two Scoops” tutorial. Why couldn’t I make the tool I had dreamed of?

Using Django and Mezzanine as a base, I gradually built a system that allows Code.org curriculum writers to write faster, more consistent, and better supported lessons at a massive scale. Along the way, I also dealt with the very real concerns of my engineering team. How can we be sure this will scale to our 10’s of thousands of teachers? What about our millions of students? How can we be certain that this doesn’t introduce new security vulnerabilities to our site? Are you sure you know what you’re doing here?

The answer to all of these problems was surprising simple, and has allowed me to address the needs of our curriculum team without taking the engineering team’s focus away from the customers that really matter - teachers and students.

After many months of development, CurriculumBuilder has become an essential internal tool for curriculum writing at Code.org, and continues to find new ways to solve problems that would otherwise go unaddressed. Not bad for a Middle School CS teacher who had never before written software used by others.

[Music]

00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:19,890
thank you just just so we know this is

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,470
my first talk at a technology conference

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,210
I talk in front of thousands and

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,430
thousands of teachers a year but I don't

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,560
ever talk in front of developers so this

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,119
is weird for me and if I make like

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,399
middle school he jokes that don't land

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,910
on you just give me the benefit of the

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,190
doubt so Who am I I am a recovering

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,050
middle school teacher I taught computer

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,340
science and robotics and English in

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,579
middle school for years and years before

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,530
coming to code org where I now develop

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,510
computer science curriculum and help

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,690
develop new teachers to teach computer

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,280
science I am NOT an engineer I didn't

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,410
come from an engineering background I

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,870
actually had my degree in theater before

00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,850
I thought I've never like done a real

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,429
life engineering thing before this thing

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,589
that I'm going to show you today but I

00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,970
am a button for punishment which is how

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:07,650
I ended up in this situation in the

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,470
first place

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,590
who is code.org though if you don't know

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,120
code.org our our mission is to ensure

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,280
that every student in every school in

00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,530
America gets the opportunity to learn

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,150
computer science we do that in a lot of

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,130
different ways so we have a branch that

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,810
does advocacy and outreach and working

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,670
with governments to help ensure that

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,990
there's funding for computer science or

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,360
that there's pathways for teachers to

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,820
get trained we have a whole group of

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,620
folks that work with training teachers

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,330
we have groups that reach out to school

00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,800
districts to try and import the

00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,060
importance of computer science to them

00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,590
and then they have my team which

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,830
actually makes the curriculum to teach

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,540
computer science to those kids we are a

00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:49,050
relatively small team for the amount of

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,370
work that we do of this small team I

00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,810
guess you can't actually tell the

00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,250
difference between the yellow shirts but

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,810
about half those yellow shirts are our

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,700
engineers so we are a small team in

00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,900
general to do a lot of different things

00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,850
and we have a relatively small

00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,640
engineering team but we have a massive

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:05,040
reach we actually reach one in five

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,230
students in American schools so one in

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,940
five students in the entire United

00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,220
States of America uses some form of our

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,830
curriculum as he said I just finished a

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,510
summer of training up 1,500 new computer

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,830
science teachers and we do that every

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,319
year so we do a lot of work with a

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,999
really small team to make that work

00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,099
happen our engineers make some really

00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:24,989
pretty fantastic tools to teach

00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:26,520
programming and computer science so we

00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:28,980
we have tools that

00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,360
teach programming in ways that may be

00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,940
interesting to students you may have

00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,730
seen this programmable minecraft that we

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,800
worked with Microsoft on we work on

00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,020
tools that make students are allow

00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,460
students to be expressive and that's

00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,960
really wonderful because we get to use

00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,420
those tools we get to design our courses

00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,430
around those tools so this is my

00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,740
bailiwick there's the middle school

00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,660
realm of things so that science algebra

00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,550
seus discoveries those are the courses I

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,250
make and we we do a lot of different

00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,960
courses but despite the great tools we

00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,000
have to use in our courses we have

00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,280
historically had very poor tools to

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,930
create those courses with right we're

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,610
the you know you never put all of your

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,320
energy on your in-house stuff you put

00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,170
your energy into the stuff that faces

00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,180
teachers and students so as a curriculum

00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,940
developer we had a real hard time making

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,200
solid lessons for teachers because we

00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,120
were using a whole bunch of platforms

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,310
whether it's markdown at Google Docs or

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,660
PDF we were manually creating all of

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,850
these different overviews if you've

00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,020
never seen a curriculum there's lessons

00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,790
but then there's all of this other

00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,960
material that kind of combines them into

00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,030
different views that we had to make

00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,740
manually there was no metadata we were

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,780
inconsistent about our style and our

00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,820
format and there was a ton of tribal

00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,290
knowledge right we were very small team

00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,540
so every person who had kind of

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,430
developed a system of working had that

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,320
locked away in their head and it was

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,650
very hard for somebody to join a new

00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,540
thing just to give you an idea of the

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,010
kinds of things that go into a lesson

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,870
plan the things that we grapple with

00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,630
that we were doing in these Google Docs

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,950
or markdown files every lesson plan has

00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,840
learning objectives what do we want

00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,070
students again we have material to prep

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,200
things you might need things you might

00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,840
need to do digital resources videos

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,280
files all kinds of stuff new vocabulary

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,840
that's introduced no code that's

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,820
introduced and overview of purpose tags

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,350
and keywords related extension lessons

00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,970
assessment information Hawaiian learning

00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,730
standards just all of this stuff that

00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:16,770
gets fed into a lesson plan that was

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,989
happening in these static pages and if

00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:21,480
you updated one you had to go and update

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:25,200
a jillion other places it was painful

00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:30,780
and so I said to myself can't be that

00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:32,820
hard why don't we just like make a thing

00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,650
that lets us write lesson plans the way

00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,090
we want to do it because I had asked our

00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,250
engineers and they're very nice people

00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:40,490
but they had a lot on their plate and I

00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:43,920
was not their priority so

00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:47,970
maybe unwisely I decided I was going to

00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,440
try this out on my own so I had never

00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,360
done anything with Django before but I

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,920
like Python atop Python I thought this

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,570
doesn't seem too hard I found a pretty

00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,220
cool package called mezzanine which if

00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,660
you've seen it is kind of a CMS e

00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,600
package it's got a lot of the things I

00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,730
wanted I mashed him together and kind of

00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,160
cobbled together a thing that kind of

00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:07,530
did what I wanted and I product to my

00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,500
engineering team and I was like check

00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:12,480
out the beautiful thing I made and I

00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,780
don't think that they saw that I think

00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,580
they saw this they were they they gave

00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,470
me a pat on the head they're like good

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,870
job buddy we're real proud and we'll put

00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:26,760
that on the fridge but we're not putting

00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:28,350
it on our website they did however work

00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,910
with me a little bit they said all right

00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,800
you really want this to happen you want

00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,020
to have a new tool you want to write

00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:38,250
better lesson plans here's our

00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:41,250
requirements whatever you make cannot

00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,600
interact with our main code org site we

00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,730
don't want to introduce any security

00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,160
flaws whatever you do sits on its own

00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:49,410
thing in fact it's got to like stay out

00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,330
of the ecosystem entirely you can't be

00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,040
on our AWS account you can't have any of

00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:57,960
our support any of our tools and ever

00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:59,430
anything this lives in the woods we're

00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,050
gonna minimize any organizational

00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,600
dependency if this thing disappeared

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,670
tomorrow cuz you made it so poorly we

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,500
should not know about it so whatever you

00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:11,640
do should be able to continue existing

00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:13,350
without the tool you're on your own for

00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,700
everything that was not clear before we

00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:18,510
are not helping you with this this is

00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:20,060
your own problem by the way it's got to

00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:24,150
support over a hundred thousand teachers

00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:25,650
that's like real easy huh and to support

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:30,590
those hundred thousand teachers you get

00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,590
a budget of zero dollars

00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,259
and I think the intent was to like talk

00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:41,300
me off the edge yeah I guess clearly

00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:46,159
nobody is going to pursue this this

00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:48,289
would be a terrible I got a new plan I'm

00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:49,639
a glutton for punishment as I said

00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:51,169
earlier so I said alright if I've got to

00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:53,479
do all of these things right if it's got

00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:54,860
to be able to live that the tool dies if

00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,330
it's got to be able to support a hundred

00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,180
thousand or a million or a jillion

00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:00,560
teachers I know that static websites can

00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,180
do that maybe I'll just make a thing

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,800
that generates a static website that'd

00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:08,750
be pretty easy sure why not

00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,650
so phase two we start calling this in

00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:14,210
curriculum it's got a name so it's real

00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:16,400
we host it on premise because again I've

00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:18,169
got a zero dollar budget so I find an

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,000
old computer I throw it up in the office

00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:22,819
and I start hosting it here for our

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,819
internal use I make really really

00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:28,039
opinionated models and I developed my

00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:30,099
own markdown filters because one of our

00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:32,180
goals here is to eliminate all of that

00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:33,969
tribal knowledge that was locked away

00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,080
I'd build consistency so am I making

00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:37,969
opinionated approaches to writing lesson

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,130
plans we ensured that whoever jumped

00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:45,560
onto this tool was gonna do it in a very

00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:47,389
narrow way I found a cool thing called

00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,039
Django Jack Frost if you've not seen I

00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:50,569
looked through all a bunch of different

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:54,229
static site generators and I found one

00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:56,090
that ended up working for me I looked it

00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:58,130
up - Django storages - push it out to an

00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:59,690
s3 bucket and then all I had to do to my

00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,610
engineers would say point your links at

00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,779
this bunch of static files for all you

00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,430
know I could have made these in

00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:07,069
Dreamweaver they just they're it's a

00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:10,009
website have fun so I was able to not

00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:11,810
live in their ecosystem and it actually

00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:14,000
like worked out really really really

00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,650
well this this first approach at a thing

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,870
that I thought was gonna fail we had

00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:19,550
more consistent lessons we had control

00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,229
over formatting in fact we could sweep

00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,699
over the whole course of things and

00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:24,860
change them all at once which was never

00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:26,569
something we could do before riders

00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,279
could self publish I built a little

00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:29,810
front-end thing so that they could click

00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:31,370
publish on their things and now we don't

00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,169
have to ask engineers to push out new

00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,610
content for us it was really easy to

00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:36,110
update it was really easy to create all

00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,669
those met abuse so if the principal came

00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,829
to me and said I need a calendar of

00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:42,079
every standard that gets hit across this

00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:43,550
and you know mapped across the year I

00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:45,620
could make that because all the data

00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:46,760
existed now this was really exciting for

00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,320
us

00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,350
we still had a handful of challenges

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,120
though we had multiple sources of truth

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,740
before but it was like a thousand

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,589
multiple sources of truth and now we had

00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,630
to and that felt real weird we have our

00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:01,490
online learning platform that my real

00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:04,610
engineers make and then we had this

00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:06,199
curriculum thing that I made and there

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,480
were places where they duplicated

00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:10,160
content they didn't communicate we had a

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,630
lot more internal users joining this we

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,220
had interns starting to use it we had

00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,870
teachers who we had on board it's

00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,480
starting to use it because it was such

00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,190
an easy way to write our curriculum

00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,019
started evolving we got past the first

00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,389
year and we wanted to change things and

00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:24,980
that introduced new issues and probably

00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:26,750
the the biggest challenge of all is this

00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,570
turned out to be like a really big

00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:32,240
project and as I said before no engineer

00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,730
am i and this was the first real thing

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:42,980
that I'd ever made

00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:44,660
so we interface through how do we

00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,760
consolidate truth and communicate

00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,100
between two tools that do very different

00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,199
things but need to maintain a lot of

00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,910
similar content so level builder which

00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:54,019
is our tool that the engineers made for

00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,510
making all of our online learning

00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:57,860
progressions new things about level

00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,569
progressions it needed to know things

00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,639
about the instructions for students or

00:09:59,569 --> 00:10:03,800
teacher tips the starting code for

00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:05,180
different projects exemplars what a

00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,240
final project should look like that's

00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:11,389
the truth that this tool should know in

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,709
my new tool it should know the truth of

00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:14,839
the teaching guide and the additional

00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:16,819
resources and files of videos and lesson

00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:18,199
description and assessments and

00:10:16,819 --> 00:10:19,730
objectives and standards and all of

00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:21,380
those things on that slide that I was

00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:24,319
showing you before vocab and code

00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,910
whatever and the goal was to have those

00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:30,319
things live in one place but how am I

00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:33,260
ever gonna do that well I got my

00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:34,760
engineers to give me a JSON endpoint so

00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,290
I could get all of that good stuff at a

00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:41,529
level builder and put it into my lesson

00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:43,850
plans but I was not allowed to

00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:45,829
communicate with our tools all right

00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:49,010
remember I got to be outside of these

00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:53,569
this dream I cannot let my tool get into

00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:55,130
their tool so I went back to the drawing

00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,630
board and I said if static worked so

00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,280
well for everything else could static

00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:01,070
work for JSON

00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:03,110
and it turned out like yeah static could

00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:05,150
work for Jessa that was kind of a cool

00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:07,460
discovery that I made that I could

00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:09,710
publish out essentially a static API and

00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:11,660
again there is no communication my tool

00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,430
exploded tomorrow if that server that's

00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:16,520
sitting in the corner of the office hot

00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:18,980
fire no harm no foul

00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:21,290
I also was able to use this to build

00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,610
some more interactivity into the into

00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:25,250
the lesson plans that we've made because

00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:27,350
if I had this API for the other site to

00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,180
access I had it for our own site so I

00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,320
started to take the static thing and

00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,000
make it a little less static with a

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,400
little JavaScript and everybody was

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,660
happy all of those hundreds of thousands

00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,340
of teachers were using this we've

00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,020
migrated all of our curriculum on to

00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:43,370
this thing and it actually kind of

00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:45,500
worked and it was amazing and that need

00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:47,480
for more users to be on the system in

00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,700
our curricula evolved meant I needed to

00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,740
be able to audit what was happening

00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,000
there were teachers doing this people

00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,110
who weren't in the office with me doing

00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,540
this I needed to OTO what they were

00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:58,520
doing I needed to recover if anything

00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,930
had gone terribly awry and I went back

00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,250
out to the Internet and I said there's

00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,540
got to be a package for this and it

00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,250
turns out there were packages for this

00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,390
it's amazing

00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,070
so I found a package called Django

00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:09,320
reversion which let me keep that version

00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:11,540
history and roll back and another one

00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,730
called reversion compare which gave me

00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,130
like a giddy kind of view into all of

00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:18,110
this work so now I'm able to support all

00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:20,420
of those other people that are using

00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:22,820
this and I'm able to have some level of

00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:25,580
control over whether what they make

00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:27,320
lands we also were able to expose some

00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,970
of this to teachers so now I can let my

00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,370
teachers know this was the last time I

00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:35,210
thing was updated and this is why it's

00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:42,290
kind of cool that big project thing

00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:45,710
though that's still a problem I'm kind

00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:51,230
of in this phase right now

00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:54,740
it definitely drives but no mechanic is

00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:58,340
going to look at this so there's there's

00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:01,340
progress yet to be made but it works and

00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:03,350
I I'm kind of amazed that it works some

00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:05,240
takeaways that I found in doing this to

00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,770
give you perspective of somebody coming

00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,600
totally as an outsider having never

00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,900
never done a thing like this never

00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,180
worked with Django before

00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:15,150
there's a package for damn near

00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:17,370
everything so these are some of the ones

00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:20,610
that I found the most useful but there

00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:24,000
there were many many more sometimes way

00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:25,860
too many and and I think that is a an

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,080
issue for somebody coming to this new is

00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:31,220
that it is very difficult to canonically

00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,990
find the best thing to do a thing and

00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:35,730
django packages proved to be a very

00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,800
useful place for me to go but it still

00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,630
meant that sometimes i was testing out

00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,010
four or five or six different packages

00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:44,040
before I found something that kind of

00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:46,490
did what I wanted and I'd like I'd like

00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:49,260
to see somebody take ownership over

00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:54,450
really vetting and providing new new

00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:56,790
users a guide to what's the best start

00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:58,440
small and don't be afraid to iterate

00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:00,150
these are things that I tell my students

00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,040
that are really hard for me to take on

00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:03,570
and I think they're really hard for any

00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,950
of us right you want to start with the

00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,529
end point you want to start with the

00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:09,960
thing that does all the beautiful things

00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:11,670
but I was only able to get here because

00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,720
I took really small steps one at a time

00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:18,450
and each one built on the last one

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:21,029
there's a lot of tutorials out there but

00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:23,250
there's not as much great instruction

00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:24,750
and as as an educator this is something

00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,610
that I want to bring to the community to

00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,110
say it's it's okay that there are

00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:30,390
tutorials that are just strictly

00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,860
tutorials meaning do this do this do

00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:34,290
this and you'll end up at an end point

00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,660
but when you want to bring new users and

00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,370
new people into the fold you also need

00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,630
to help them identify where the great

00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:41,370
instruction is happening so you

00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:43,620
understand the concepts behind why

00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:46,110
you're doing this I think one of the

00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,000
biggest challenges that I found him

00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:50,070
going into Django was that when you go

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,470
through the official tutorial there's

00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,450
like 47 different ways to set up a view

00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:57,209
and it has you go through all of them

00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:59,490
and and I don't know what the best way

00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:01,800
is for what I want to do and so really

00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:03,690
thinking about how do we instruct any

00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:07,250
users on how to wrap their minds around

00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:09,180
this is something I'd really like to see

00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:11,940
you should take advantage of the

00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:13,650
community like I totally didn't in fact

00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,630
this is the first time I have engaged

00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:18,180
with the Django community I like to just

00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:19,890
jump into the deep end so why not talk

00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:22,500
into conference as my first interaction

00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:23,080
with anybody but really there's like

00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,660
I've been

00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,519
I've been lurking on the slack community

00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,839
for Seattle Django users forever but

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,160
I've never engaged with them I've never

00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:31,510
gone to a meeting you should take

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,649
advantage of this community because it

00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:36,730
is it is a very big and powerful commune

00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:40,450
clearly if you're here you're doing that

00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:44,320
to some extent personally maybe this is

00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:47,950
more a a reflection for me but you might

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,350
find use of this be aware of I bet you

00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:52,269
can't or the all when all you have is a

00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:54,459
hammer mentality this is something I

00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:56,890
found because I was now I was now the

00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:58,779
sole engineer of a thing that I was the

00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:00,250
user for and my team were the users for

00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:02,470
so it was really easy for them to kind

00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,839
of saddle up next to me and go you know

00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,640
I've I bet you couldn't make this thing

00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:09,579
also support all of our documentation

00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:12,310
for all of our tools well now it does

00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:14,470
that too I bet you couldn't hook it up

00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:16,870
to slack so that we could like publish

00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:19,000
from a slack command or see what was

00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,959
going on and who out well okay I guess

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,660
we'll do that too

00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:25,480
I bet you couldn't hook it up to a tiny

00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:27,190
servo and a gong on our desk so that we

00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:34,589
could have a slack command that rang a

00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:37,450
gong Wow I'm not real good at saying no

00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:42,700
but it is kind of a cute little gun

00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:44,860
at least that I was really worried I was

00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,050
gonna go along on this so fortunately I

00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:50,529
did not I want to thank you but the real

00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:54,399
reason I came here is because I need

00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:57,970
help I started this thing and it's now

00:16:54,399 --> 00:17:00,010
grown too big for me and so I am I am

00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:01,839
here reaching out we have engineering

00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:04,809
openings but we also have a lot of

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:07,120
volunteer engineers the code Network

00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:08,800
slash about slash jobs I don't know that

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,260
there's a ton of postings right now but

00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,689
we're always taking engineering

00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:15,790
positions the volunteer there is more

00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:17,079
less for volunteering to help me figure

00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:18,429
this out if you want to do that please

00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:20,860
talk to me that's for getting into

00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:22,900
classrooms and we have teachers all over

00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,819
the country who are begging to get

00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,860
people working in industry into the

00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:28,449
classrooms they want to get faces that

00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:30,100
look like they're students faces so that

00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:32,650
they can have somebody tell them that

00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,970
this is a real thing that you can do so

00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,100
I would really encourage you if you're

00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,200
at all interested in students

00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,120
to sign up on that because you will get

00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,289
posts from teachers saying could you

00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,490
just come in to talk to my kids about

00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:44,140
something often they're not even

00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:45,429
computer science teachers they're just

00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,600
teachers who know that computer science

00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:51,070
is important but they don't know what to

00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:52,990
do when you can help that's the end of

00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:59,860
my slide so I have time for questions I

00:17:52,990 --> 00:18:02,260
don't know what you'd ask me great talk

00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,730
thank you my question is if you were to

00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,140
do it all over again knowing what you

00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:14,409
know now how would you do it differently

00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:16,330
hole because I still have my full-time

00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:19,600
job writing curriculum and this takes

00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,860
just a lot of time I don't I I honestly

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,570
don't know that I would do it

00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,760
differently than I had done it unless I

00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:27,220
came to it with prior knowledge I would

00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:30,309
start with the static stuff I would I

00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:32,049
would start really constrained and not

00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,700
build out all of these other features

00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:40,000
that turn out to be really nice things

00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:41,710
but said you were a middle school

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,740
teacher originally awesome did you find

00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:48,159
as you were building this building this

00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:50,500
out that you drew references from your

00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:51,610
teaching experience and trying to think

00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,700
about it from the students perspective

00:18:51,610 --> 00:19:02,830
sort of or I were able to use that

00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:04,990
experience you need to play and you need

00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:07,090
to take small steps and not buying off

00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:09,250
more than you can chew and then I would

00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:11,770
realize that I'd gone for days without

00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:14,409
committing and I was just like randomly

00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:16,870
going down a rabbit hole because that's

00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:18,730
that's the mentality that I got into so

00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,870
it made me empathize with my students

00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,190
and every time I yell at them it's

00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:23,470
important that I yell at them because we

00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:25,480
need to be reminded that that this is

00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:27,250
the natural inclination is not to like

00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,190
lay everything out ahead of us and plan

00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:34,960
and move very slowly but that doesn't

00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:38,250
make it easy to do then it's time for

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:45,690
the break I believe which is downstairs

00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:45,690
