	DjangoCon US 2017 - Getting the most out of Djangoâ€™s User Model by Julia M. Looney

Djangoâ€™s User model is nice, but the fields it provides out of the box are minimal. We frequently need to associate our own custom data with a user, and luckily Django provides ways for us to add to its built-in User model. This talk will help novice Django developers understand which options are best when it comes to getting the most out of the Django User model.

Iâ€™ll start by talking about the built-in Django User model and what it has to offer.

Then I will identify scenarios when the User model might not be enough for a project, and why someone might want something with more flexibility. Then weâ€™ll look at the different ways to get the most out of the Django User model. There are two main methods Iâ€™ll cover:

Extending the User model
Creating a custom User model


Extending the User model:

Extending the User model is handy when you only need to add a few extra fields. There are two main ways to do this: using a proxy model, and using a OneToOneField. I will cover the pros and cons of each, and give examples for implementing each.

Creating a custom User model:

With this method, you can substitute Djangoâ€™s default User model with your own. Though more complex, a custom User model is particularly useful when you need to uniquely identify users by email address instead of by username. Iâ€™ll go into a couple more scenarios where a custom User model would be helpful, and show examples of implementation.

Lastly, I will show how each method works with the default Django admin, and how they can be managed there.
