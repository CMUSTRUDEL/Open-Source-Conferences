	DjangoCon US 2017 - Opening Keynote - Is it too late to learn how to program?  by Alicia V. Carr

Alicia will discuss the challenges she faced as an African American woman in becoming an iOS developer at the age of 51. As a self-taught developer, she created a mobile app dedicated to helping victims escape domestic violence and abuse. She has seen the best and worst of the tech community. As demonstrated by her app, she believes that the tech industry can improve and change lives if we open our arms, embrace change, and think about how women can change the way we see and create apps.

00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:33,860
my life I did not expect this to happen

00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:40,550
but this is something that every person

00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:44,000
need to hear how Social Development

00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:54,260

Twitter I talk to women about being in

00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,859
technology and not realizing that

00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:01,420
they're in technology when they work for

00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:05,140
in the tech community also one to

00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,140
acknowledge woman :

00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:18,350
No 8% of women I have no experience in

00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:25,070
Aqaba so we expose women to him at this

00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:30,979
event so what's my elevator pitch my

00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:33,950
elevator pitch is I'm the first African

00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:36,460
American self-taught iOS developer that

00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:39,229
created the first domestic violence app

00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:41,979
for the state of Georgia at the age of

00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:41,979
51 and

00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:53,960
so we're crazy how much I have all been

00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:57,740
technology but the crazy thing was that

00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:00,470
I always been an apple fanatic I would

00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,930
stand on line in my second generation

00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:08,030
iPad I met the 16 oh boy

00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:10,130
and I was like you know oh oh don't

00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:15,350
parent it in French I can find people

00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:19,600
pointing inaudible either that's a card

00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,600
no payment that should mortgage so I

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:48,160
build an app I'm like oh so you punch

00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:48,160
with Armour you know I was like okay

00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:19,430
okay whatever so see y'all still can

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:21,320
hear me right so I went ahead start

00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,700
doing my research looked at some school

00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,709
big nerve ranch was located in Atlanta

00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,420
but they wouldn't take me in because

00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:27,799
they wanted you had to pay for the whole

00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,299
thing and call the hotel and I was like

00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:30,530
why won't give you money for a hotel I

00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:33,320
live down the street from y'all that's

00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:35,750
not gonna happen so I reached out to a

00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:38,239
meetup group in Atlanta Co Atlanta iOS

00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:40,160
developers group final mentor he helped

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,840
me with the big nerd ranch book which I

00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,769
wasn't too good at I hate reading and

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,410
every time I read I was skipping over

00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:50,450
something creating this app for I'm

00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,650
learning iOS or an object to see because

00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,269
this is the first time I'm learning

00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,820
Objective C Objective C took me a year

00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:57,919
to have to learn because I didn't feel

00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,620
confident enough to believe that I knew

00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:01,490
what I was doing I you know as a woman

00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,560
we have to build

00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:06,680
confident men are more than welcome

00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,140
fidus so I wasn't I mean my problem was

00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:13,420
what did I have the ability to learn

00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:18,700
Objective C so October it was September

00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:21,739
2013 somebody posted a bootcamp on

00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,720
actual meter for Lana iOS developer for

00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:26,720
$125 for bootcamp was a three month

00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,400
bootcamp which I'll know right now if I

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,720
pay $125 for bootcamp

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,180
that is overpriced right now and

00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,850
actually that three months learning

00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,050
Objective C I learned it understood it

00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:42,770
had no problem with it

00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:44,570
and at the end of that time I reached up

00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:48,230
to my mentors I was shoot I don't you

00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:49,700
know I finish up this the tutorial I

00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,530
don't know what to do he said well you

00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,510
know why don't we you know work together

00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:58,370
and build domestic violence app and I

00:04:53,510 --> 00:05:00,470
was I started crying because um my

00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:02,330
family my friends I've lost a girlfriend

00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:05,240
from domestic violence she got shot in

00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,860
her driveway my mother was a victim my

00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,960
aunt was a victim my daughters were

00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,240
victims of domestic violence for victims

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,590
of domestic violence and I knew them

00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,840
that when he mentioned it that was

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:16,670
something I needed to do me and him had

00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:21,110
a conflict or how we wanted to build so

00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:23,540
I went rogue I did that on my own

00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:25,880
and what I did is I did a lot of

00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:29,000
research to figure out what should be in

00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:33,950
there so when I did that the first

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,740
version of the app was called purple

00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:39,050
pocketbook and it was and my son helped

00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,810
me build it for Android now me and him

00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:43,490
had bump heads with it but he did do it

00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:46,130
for me and he succeeded in completing it

00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:50,630
so that version is on it's actually

00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:51,890
still on Google Play I had to reach Ange

00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,500
the name comes it was a conflict of

00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:57,050
interest with purple purse which is

00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,770
Allstate so they reach out to me and

00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,770
told me I had to

00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,919
they said there was a conflict and I

00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,930
need to change the name so I had to

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,669
change the name cross the board but the

00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:16,160
only place it hasn't changed is Google

00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:19,550
Play so in 2014 and 2014 I built an app

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,070
in three months try to submit it to

00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,870
Apple all hell broke loose with that

00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,240
Apple don't told me rejected me too many

00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,340
damn times so and it was because the

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,870
size of the app that's the screen size

00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:34,700
and we're wrong so the original I was

00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,470
any I was building it the long way the

00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,360
bigger waiters the screen size when the

00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,610
phone was still smaller so I had to go

00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,520
in and change all the screen size to

00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:46,610
what the app was actually the phone size

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,380
was and that took a couple of hours

00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,110
I fixed it submitted it it was approved

00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,760
in our apple and may 2nd I could never

00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:57,370
forget that day you never forget a day

00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:57,370
when it took you months to submit it so

00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:04,910
later on 2015 we had to change the name

00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:09,560
to people so the original app is now

00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:14,510
called purple evolution Peabo of course

00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:15,500
then when Nicole came along around the

00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,120
time I was building the app I would

00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,210
having problems one of the members of

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,490
them - Cole who is not a developer

00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:24,260
helped me fix the problem so we went to

00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,610
Starbucks and we went through the Apple

00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,979
forum and we found out what the problem

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:31,610
was and that's how I came apart of women

00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:34,669
code because I realized that when I

00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:41,300
reached out to the men it was more so I

00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:44,030
felt uncomfortable I felt that it was

00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,789
emotional thing because you know um some

00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:50,539
of the men were being very controlling

00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:51,680
and you know it was I didn't feel

00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:53,150
comfortable talking to him because I

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,010
didn't want to be I'm building this app

00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,419
I didn't want that I was already an

00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,740
emotional strain because it was a

00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:00,050
domestic violence app and I need

00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,560
somebody to actually say sit down let's

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,450
go do it

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,039
we found the issue let's fix the issue

00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:06,200
and that's how I became a member to

00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:08,479
women code I created a group and women

00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,400
call called women iOS developers crew to

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,169
help women to learn how to call on learn

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,009
objective-c

00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:18,680
from there them helping me with the app

00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:21,409
making it more successful was everything

00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:24,560
and so being a part of women occult was

00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:28,610
you know once it was fixed it I was so

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,409
happy I was just so happy so once I got

00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:33,430
there and started building my I did my

00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:35,329
group one of the rector's say hey Lisa

00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:38,620

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,939
the t-shirt I said thank you

and this is what it looked like when I

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:55,189
got there

00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:58,669
Apple was looking for me and they said

00:10:55,189 --> 00:11:02,929
we want a high like you at a at a

00:10:58,669 --> 00:11:04,279
keynote I said okay so when they say

00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,539
highlight me at the keynote I was like

00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:07,189
what we want you to when you know how we

00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:09,049
take pictures and it goes through the

00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:10,849
screen right before the event I said

00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:12,319
yeah it's like we want to put you in

00:11:10,849 --> 00:11:13,579
there that's okay he said but you have

00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:20,449
to be out there by 5:30 in the morning

00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:24,729
I'm like okay we got out there about

00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:30,169
5:45 I was like I was exhausted and so

00:11:24,729 --> 00:11:33,379
what happened was is this Apple had me

00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:35,479
on the keynote and that's exactly what

00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:38,809
they did I was the first black woman to

00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:41,239
be highlighted at the keynote on 2015

00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:42,649
and actually the first one they put

00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:45,259
their name on they put my full name on

00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:47,689
but they put my name out there which was

00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:54,470
amazing so I was already excited about

00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:58,489
that you know and so life went on and so

00:11:54,470 --> 00:12:01,729
they contact me again next year this

00:11:58,489 --> 00:12:04,299
time they wanted to find people that

00:12:01,729 --> 00:12:08,449
actually build the app for social cause

00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:09,979
so you know how Apple going through you

00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:11,389
know Apple have all the data they went

00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,559
through everybody in their app store

00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:14,629
they narrowed down to a couple of

00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,439
hundred then they've interviewed them

00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:19,999
and went down to less than 100 then they

00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:21,619
contacted me the the documenting company

00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:23,689
contact me of your email I thought this

00:12:21,619 --> 00:12:26,779
was some Gray's crazy as women stalking

00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:27,949
me so I was like I'm not gonna email you

00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,379
back I'm gonna call you just to verify

00:12:27,949 --> 00:12:33,619
that the number works

00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:35,539
call her up her name is Alicia she tells

00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:36,559
me we want to interview you we want to

00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:38,119
talk about you so we did an interview

00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:39,010
over the phone then we did an interview

00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:41,860
on skype

00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:43,270
I had to send her pictures and I was a

00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,590
Russian this because like I really

00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:48,610
didn't give a damn I didn't think it was

00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:49,150
real so I basically it's like she calls

00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,350
me upset

00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:54,210
I need the pictures now I need the

00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,210
pictures now I'm flying out to see you

00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:59,920
so I sent a picture with my family my

00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:03,040
kids and everybody she came in she

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,080
interview people around me she was

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,670
waiting for replied from the director

00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,930
and it's like apparently you know you

00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,400
know it doesn't look like they're

00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,320
interested I was like yes thank you

00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,700
Jesus

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,650
so I was happy I was doing my other

00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:17,140
thing setting up working other things

00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:19,750
were going to code and I also had got a

00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:23,680
scholarship to go to Google i/o and so

00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:25,780
while I was there at the keynote which

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,270
was less than 15 minutes to start I get

00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:31,270
a call from the documentary people we're

00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:33,430
coming to Atlanta Memorial Day weekend

00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:35,860
well babe you can't do that more Day

00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:36,910
weekend that can't happen she's like

00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,540
what what's the problem

00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:42,520
kids got out of school everybody's gone

00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:44,230
they wanted all my friends and I'm like

00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,080
baby we can't do that you said well in

00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:52,350
California we we stay at home no this is

00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:55,840
Georgia everybody get ready kids four

00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:58,780
and so all my friends couldn't be there

00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:03,790
but all my children was able to be there

00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:08,470
so with that I had to have the app also

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:11,170
more current to Apple standards for them

00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:14,200
to even put me in the video so I was

00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:16,150
communicating with somebody at Apple to

00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,240
actually help me fix the app to make it

00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:20,710
current I was crying because I had

00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,860
Objective C and Swift in there

00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:27,460
it wasn't playing nice um and it was

00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,750
like panicking and so the guy who I was

00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,040
talking to us like he said well he

00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,510
should would you let me see my car I

00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:36,360
said I would have to cut off your pinky

00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:39,280
toe you know let nobody see my so

00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:43,900
he said no problem I send the link and

00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:48,820
so he actually came down and he came to

00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:51,340
Atlanta and he actually helped me fix my

00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,740
coat in one day and I was so worried

00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,899
about the

00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:58,290
the fact that the coat my coat was so

00:14:54,899 --> 00:15:00,450
ugly it wasn't clean and he and I was

00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,040
like I'm sorry you know it's not what I

00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:04,290
wanted you to look at I'm embarrassed

00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,029
how my coat look he said Alicia your

00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:08,750
coat is better than any of the

00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:14,850
developers I'm working with right now so

00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:16,950
I was alright with that so after that

00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:19,320
was all done he fixed everything we they

00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:21,060
had me go crazy places having me run up

00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,490
and down the street but I'm gonna show

00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:31,459
you what happened with it I hope I have

00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:31,459
sound with this I really do hello world

00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:41,399
[Music]

00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,100
in the beginning my biggest challenge

00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:46,380
was not having access to a computer the

00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,450
first line of code I wrote was bouncing

00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,610
board it would bounce around the screen

00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:53,610
hit the edges and then come back again I

00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:56,310
think the first one was like a to-do

00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:58,110
list it was a to-do list I remember the

00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:00,110
first time I did it when it worked and

00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:02,959
it was like magical

00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:07,010
I can do anything with code anything I

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:12,079
can think about I can do it in Vail to

00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:15,140
experience power outages every day so

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:17,089
let me see if I can just do an algorithm

00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:23,050
that can provide the electricity cut of

00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:26,959
time it shouldn't cost life to give life

00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:32,329
but if we compress all these health

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:35,510
guidelines into small movies I'm one

00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:39,529
person that saw a problem and created a

00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:42,649
solution to stop or assist a woman in

00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:48,050
domestic violence what we wanted what we

00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:52,540
needed didn't exist so at some point you

00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:52,540
just say okay well let's do it ourselves

00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:58,840
let's make an app

00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:01,300
well when I first started app has to

00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:04,320
have a plan we start with that little

00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:07,240
glimmer that seed of a new fresh idea

00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:09,700
there's this fear of code like it's so

00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,770
hard or it's inaccessible but actually

00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:14,170
it's not someone who doesn't even know

00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:16,720
code at all cuz they really studied some

00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:18,910
simple Swift code they would probably be

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,500
able to understand it anything's

00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:24,940
possible that it all comes from that

00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:27,040
first step launching that was a big

00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:30,010
moment actually I told everyone about it

00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:32,800
like download rapids on the App Store I

00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:39,390
was dancing I called my girlfriend that

00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:41,680
I cried to wishes so many dreams I

00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:44,650
always tell my students do you operate

00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:48,970
with electricity my son made it he built

00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:52,660
it and be care that is a single by the

00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:57,120
end of 2016 1 million women will have a

00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:57,120
safe birth due to the safe delivery app

00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,910
people come together in public spaces it

00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,220
creates a kind of happiness and it

00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:08,659
creates a kind of like healing effect

00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:11,239
for the soul

00:18:08,659 --> 00:18:13,549
dear Kyra young people like you are

00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:15,399
tomorrow's leaders you inspire me and

00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:17,899
give me tremendous hope for the future

00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:21,829
Michelle and I wish you all the best

00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:24,499
sincerely Barack Obama these tools are

00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:27,109
something that we desperately need when

00:18:24,499 --> 00:18:30,199
trying to change the world I think more

00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:32,569
people it can blend : to build ups the

00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:34,279
more problems goosal I feel like I'm

00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:38,790
getting stuff that can actually change

00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:40,540
the way people live which is suppose

00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:44,490
[Music]

00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:47,350
wanna beat this amazing Kota this

00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:50,020
off-the-chain senior developer where

00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:52,780
everybody comes to me if I can you fix

00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:54,970
this and I'm like yeah like not going in

00:18:52,780 --> 00:19:00,150
just type of the cold and wah-wah-wah

00:18:54,970 --> 00:19:00,150
take em down like wow you could do this

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,970
[Applause]

00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:22,150
first black woman to be highlighted in

00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:24,910
an apple how would you say video and and

00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:26,680
the other girl Kira was also the

00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:28,540
youngest before there was a young what

00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,490
she's the youngest black woman young

00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:33,970
girl to be highlighted Apple as well and

00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:36,460
Kira has been doing apps I mean she does

00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:38,230
apps all the time and I'm so proud of

00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:40,360
her because I'm told I said we need to

00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:44,260
get you to speak more as a young girl at

00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:46,330
conferences to explain to to people like

00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:49,330
like y'all out there that women young

00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:52,300
girls are very very passionate and when

00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:54,910
you talk about code we I mean I love

00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:58,630
code you know it's like I'm a dyslexic

00:19:54,910 --> 00:20:00,930
or a person with the code but then let's

00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:03,060
get to the real part of being a woman

00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:06,090
developer

00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:09,630
in tech things have changed from stereo

00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:14,450
to kobold aerial stereotypical scuse me

00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:18,990
hoodie wearing nerve glasses wearing

00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:22,340
gadget obsess over the latest hot

00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:25,170
gadgets that's me this is not only men

00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:27,450
today there are women who are more into

00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:29,340
tech trends than men but before I get

00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,700
into the facts let's get into the

00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:34,269
history

00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:36,759
so before I ask the question here is

00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:40,379
some historical data on coding hardware

00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:42,909
that is true so if you imagine computer

00:20:40,379 --> 00:20:45,549
programming as young men yeah that's

00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:46,720
true that is very true but it hasn't

00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:53,710
always been that way

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:55,749
decades women pioneers or computer

00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:58,840
programmers but that's a part of history

00:20:55,749 --> 00:21:00,460
that not everybody know about so women

00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:05,129
created code and program because men

00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:07,779
felt that coding was an admin job and

00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:11,440
and that is true and this is the thing

00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:12,789
that I think that me okay we talked

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,440
about this and we talked about this a

00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:19,090
lot in and out in women and community

00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,230
Ada Lovelace and I'm not I'm gonna just

00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,940
give you the names y'all gonna read off

00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:23,259
of this and if y'all need to do research

00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,379
this is where you'll need to research

00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:28,570
this is just a snap snap bit of what Ada

00:21:26,379 --> 00:21:30,809
Lovelace a Lovelace is the woman who

00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:34,659
created it she's the star topologist and

00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:36,340
um and women in in who code and although

00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:37,509
these other women organization make sure

00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,019
there are women are aware of these

00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:41,320
issues

00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:43,509
we're aware of the historical historic

00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,009
historical information of programming

00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:49,119
and coding came from

00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:52,679
then there's Jennifer Jenkins Bartek she

00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:57,029
was hardware as well as software

00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:59,549
and so just to see the fact that they

00:21:57,029 --> 00:22:01,110
have their hands on it and a lot of

00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:04,919
these women don't need didn't even at

00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:06,990
that time know of each other um grace

00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:10,019
Harper we as women we all know grace

00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:11,820
Harper from Anita Borg Institute so

00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:14,039
grace Harper is the one that came up

00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:18,119
with bug debugging because there was

00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:20,100
moth in the computers so if if you hear

00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:22,559
the word debugging you have to remember

00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,100
that Grace Hopper is the one that

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,039
created that

00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:29,950
and so then you talk about the human

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,090
computers Catherine Johnson is the first

00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,740
black woman for NASA

00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:35,350
everybody should notice if you haven't

00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:37,690
seen Higgins hidden figures and I watch

00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:39,520
it ten times huh that's one of my

00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,640
favorite with the with the color purple

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,990
two of those are my favorite but I've

00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,520
continued to watch it and each and every

00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:47,740
time I watch it I cry because I can

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:51,820
relate to so many things that's in there

00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,870
that as a woman relates to me so these

00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,840
are women's that you'll need to do your

00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:57,640
research on so when you go and I'm gonna

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,470
say this when you go back to work and

00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,480
when you're start saying things you can

00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,980
be the most knowledge of ones you know

00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,169
the men oh yeah

00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:07,690
Grace Hopper she created a word

00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:10,059
debugging and then the guys was like

00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:18,220
that's not true and you can say do your

00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:21,360
research so so now you know and so think

00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:24,990
about every time

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:28,170
you write on a computer play music files

00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:31,020
or add up numbers with your iPhone

00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:34,980
calculator you are using tools that

00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:45,510
might not exist without a woman women in

00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:47,610
technology so I'm gonna ask this

00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:50,070
question this is just the WIMP would you

00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:51,429
hire this person now I want you to read

00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:54,309
that

00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:56,200
oh this person has touched the computer

00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:59,519
and IBM punch on me when she was in high

00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:09,009
school okay

00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:11,950
ms-dos debase gotta first got a first

00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:15,729
job at database programmer worked on

00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:20,379
hardware learn HTML which is good to

00:24:15,729 --> 00:24:22,749
learn Oracle C++ learn Java this person

00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:24,159
loved to cold love technology which I'll

00:24:22,749 --> 00:24:27,989
have hired this person how many people

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,989
will hire this person raise your hand

00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:37,580
so that's my resume this is why you what

00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:40,350
this is why you wouldn't hire me and

00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,100
this is this is where unconscious bias

00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:44,100
set in

00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:47,280
I have interview with some of the major

00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:49,890
companies in where I live at in Atlanta

00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:52,830
some in California but Apple

00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:54,600
acknowledged me as a developer and I

00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:57,090
fully acknowledge me told me how good I

00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:00,930
was when they highlighted me twice but

00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:02,860
yet nobody will hire me because of those

00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:06,130
three biases

00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,790
and what's and more is that I love to

00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:11,140
code

00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:13,960
I love technology I do a talk on home

00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:16,390
automation okay cuz my whole house is

00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:20,290
automated with technology used in IFTTT

00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:24,910
skills all that and that's the

00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:27,460
cause of my husband but when I go for an

00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:30,730
interview and I tell them that I build

00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:33,040
an app and there's men that has not

00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:38,400
build an app and I build an app for

00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:40,679
social cause I still get the question of

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:45,539
what's the syntax do you know what a

00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:50,039
function a loop array and I'm like dude

00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:51,720
I haven't I build this app I haven't you

00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:53,669
know cold in a little bit because I'm

00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,830
pushing this app and looking for job but

00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:59,340
yet because I don't know it I don't get

00:25:55,830 --> 00:26:02,600
the job so that app don't mean nothing

00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:06,029
but if a male had the same skillset but

00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:08,700
didn't build an app they would get the

00:26:06,029 --> 00:26:11,309
job and I'm I'm more experienced in them

00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:14,480
I have the product out there I had

00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:19,440
somebody asked me about localization

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:22,860
base but she mentioned that I put all

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:27,570
the different languages in there that

00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:31,350
 wasn't easy but I've done that like

00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:33,049
that was in 2015 how the hell I'm gonna

00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:36,659
remember that in 2016

00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:40,740
you know so that becomes a challenge for

00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:44,159
me as being a developer now let's talk

00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:45,870
about the statistics only 60% of white

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,140
women are computer programmers and

00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:50,850
software engineers only 5% of Asian

00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:54,210
women are in computer programming

00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:58,230
software engineers only 5% of women of

00:26:54,210 --> 00:27:01,350
color and that 5% consider is included

00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:04,500
with Hispanic women as well with that 5%

00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:07,370
and then less 1% of women are mobile

00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:13,110
developers and less than 1% of that is

00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:16,260
me so there's not too many women my age

00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:18,960
are into technology you know and then

00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:22,799
it's not that it's sad but then I'm I'll

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,690
of what I love technology so you got

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:28,679
like I know some people out here that

00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:31,230
got like moms and dads you know there's

00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:32,580
probably my age and don't know know

00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:37,020
about technology but you can teach them

00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:38,669
how to use the iPhone so and here's some

00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:41,580
questions that I really want everybody

00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:43,529
to access selves why are you not

00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:46,590
considering women ability when their

00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:49,020
resumes are on your desk there's a lot

00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:52,340
of people that look at women's resume

00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:55,669
and they question their abilities

00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:57,500
I have one example is that I met a young

00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:59,299
lady in Seattle at a conference and

00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:03,970
she's like her and her boyfriend applied

00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:07,309
for the same job she's smarter than him

00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:09,700
she has more Skills than him they pass

00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:12,950
over her resume and interview him and

00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:15,020
then he came to her and said they

00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:19,370
interviewing me I need to learn this

00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:20,960
cold and she's like hell no I'm not

00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:23,750
teaching his coat here the damn book I

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,880
taught learn from cuz she I mean she's

00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:28,580
mad I'm I would be mad too I was like

00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:30,620
why the hell oh you think he that good

00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,880
okay then you take you show you go ahead

00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:34,490
and prove to them that you're not good

00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:37,190
and we see a lot of that you know when I

00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:39,799
talk to a lot of women why aren't women

00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:43,610
and people of color and white my

00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:46,100
accessing questions okay that's another

00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:49,010
thing that's not you know across the

00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:52,450
board how do you know a person doesn't

00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:56,600
fit in your culture during an interview

00:28:52,450 --> 00:29:07,789
another thing is is that women don't lie

00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:11,360
on their resumes if we put our if we put

00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:13,309
our hands on it and we we won't and if

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,100
we don't know it fully wound I put out

00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:18,140
on our resume because the chances of us

00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:22,940
being questioned about it it's gonna be

00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:25,779
very highly happening period if a man

00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:29,210
put it on it it doesn't make a big deal

00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:33,230
so that's the whole you know that's what

00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:39,010
the issue that we deal with why are

00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:41,149
women not being promoted okay so I

00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:43,760
taught I was at a conference and just

00:29:41,149 --> 00:29:45,770
one guy said oh I love women to code and

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:50,659
I have women working for me but the

00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:53,140
problem I have with women is they take

00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:56,950
off time to take care of their children

00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:59,839
that's the wrong thing to tell me

00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:02,419
because right then I was like you are

00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:05,869
talking to the wrong woman right now

00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:06,999
because I want to say what the hell's

00:30:05,869 --> 00:30:11,659
wrong with you

00:30:06,999 --> 00:30:15,259
we have women one thing women is where

00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:17,919
we are everything we do everything we do

00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:19,940
everything men y'all don't do everything

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,450
we take care of our children we take

00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,519
care of you

00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:24,440
we take care of the house some of us

00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:28,059
take care of bills I'm gonna tell you

00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:31,820
right now so when I was working

00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:33,709
I've been married 36 years my husband

00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,909
don't know how to my husband I love him

00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:40,309
to death please don't let him hear this

00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:45,139
video I get up at 4 o'clock in the

00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:48,019
morning and cook his breakfast I fixed

00:30:45,139 --> 00:30:50,859
his lunch and I make sure he's in the

00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:54,019
car with his green tea to go to work

00:30:50,859 --> 00:30:56,089
while I was learning iOS some

00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:58,489
objective-c I got at five o'clock in the

00:30:56,089 --> 00:31:00,649
morning did the same thing learn how to

00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:03,139
code in three months and still build

00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:05,659
that app and a lot of men don't

00:31:03,139 --> 00:31:08,239
understand that that woman who push you

00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:09,979
off to work and help you get there also

00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:13,219
have the challenges when they go to work

00:31:09,979 --> 00:31:16,879
of being being by then whether it's

00:31:13,219 --> 00:31:18,940
unconscious bias affecting her and so

00:31:16,879 --> 00:31:21,709
you got to understand that when you see

00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:23,629
your if you see that happening just

00:31:21,709 --> 00:31:25,579
imagine that woman in your office going

00:31:23,629 --> 00:31:28,820
through the same thing there's a lot I

00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:30,440
mean we're taught that men are the men

00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,299
of the household they pay the bills they

00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,279
take care of wife you take care of the

00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:35,659
children you take care of the house but

00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:37,159
then you got to understand that same man

00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:40,639
and she's working for how they're saying

00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:42,859
by is thinking and so you have to really

00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:44,570
out think you know change it like right

00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:46,700
now men are now being more active in a

00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:48,139
family but that's not being hold against

00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,450
them when they have to go take their

00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:52,039
child to a doctor whereas a woman is B

00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,149
that's being whole against them when

00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:54,979
they gotta go take their child to a

00:31:53,149 --> 00:31:57,769
doctor so we have to always think about

00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:59,629
that unconscious bias that we're putting

00:31:57,769 --> 00:32:02,089
it's not that you're bad

00:31:59,629 --> 00:32:03,950
we all have an unconscious bias that's

00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:05,210
what our brain do so okay so let me give

00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:08,389
you a perfect example my unconscious

00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:10,869
bias is I hate to see men pants hanging

00:32:08,389 --> 00:32:10,869
off they ask

00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:16,450
so one day I was driving home and I saw

00:32:14,419 --> 00:32:19,009
this man pants hanging down to his

00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:22,399
underneath his ass and I was like and

00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:26,870
I'm slowing down saying hey pull your

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:32,299
damn pants up and so you know I know you

00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:34,279
heard me but he ignore me and so the

00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:36,919
last quote I got a quote in here where I

00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:39,590
said so not okay so again not listening

00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:41,419
to women's ideas and me I hear a lot of

00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:43,000
women going through that right now and

00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:47,330
then you know the understanding is that

00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,519
the more that your make women feel

00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:52,570
uncomfortable that is why the number of

00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:57,259
women and technology is going down and

00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:58,669
we are I mean for me it's like that's

00:32:57,259 --> 00:33:02,750
another thing why you wouldn't hire me

00:32:58,669 --> 00:33:06,049
cuz I would cuss y'all asses out I would

00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:08,149
I would actually get fired actually I

00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:13,700
got written up when saying I got written

00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:17,779
up and I was saying that's up and

00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:20,360
they broke me up all right you know this

00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:21,710
is the thing that because and if a man

00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:24,049
was to say it it would've been alright

00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:25,399
but it's not so in the South those are

00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:28,460
one things in South they're not supposed

00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:31,549
to come out of woman's mouth so if a man

00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:34,220
talks over you he's being called being a

00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:36,620
man he's a man if he's talked over you

00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:41,629
if a woman talks over you she's a bossy

00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:43,250
 and so you know she again if

00:33:41,629 --> 00:33:46,059
you're woman talk over you that means

00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:49,370
she got children that get on her nerves

00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:51,110
she has like yo y'all y'all need to stop

00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:53,090
this you know she will say that and

00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:55,100
that's because although she got children

00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:57,139
or she got a sibling or she knows how it

00:33:55,100 --> 00:34:00,429
is to be treated a certain kind of way

00:33:57,139 --> 00:34:00,429
and want to get her voice heard

00:34:01,149 --> 00:34:07,610
something to think about how many women

00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:09,169
are working in your group how many

00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:11,889
people of color are working in your

00:34:09,169 --> 00:34:15,200
group why would you hire an unqualified

00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:17,629
white male with potential but not a

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:22,160
woman or person of color who are

00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:26,240
qualified and we see a lot of that too

00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:27,890
we see there's several young women that

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,660
graduated bootcamp in Atlanta their

00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:33,250
resume were off the chain and they were

00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:35,690
going against males and two of the women

00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:39,920
resumes was awesome they have excellent

00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:42,050
projects there they're the actual team

00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,610
members of the boot camp was you know

00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:45,530
because they have to rate everybody's

00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:47,990
resume and they all gave them high

00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:50,120
ratings on a resume when they went to

00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:52,100
the interview and they were competed

00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:55,430
against men now the one of them got

00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:59,500
selected one was Asian one with Hispanic

00:34:55,430 --> 00:35:03,040
and my girl Adriana it took her a year

00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:06,980
to actually find a job but is actually

00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:10,340
internship and the other young lady she

00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:12,620
felt like you know she felt bad about it

00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,270
but then you know we have certain people

00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,290
that made it clear that you don't let

00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:20,930
that go you keep going

00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:23,000
and you never give up when a woman or a

00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:27,530
person of color report to upper manager

00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:30,500
or HR bear is known to be some bias so

00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:32,980
and as you see a lot of women a lot of

00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:39,530
people have seen that with uber with

00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:41,660
Facebook with Apple HR and I've known

00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:43,520
that for experience too HR will always

00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:45,500
take the side of the other person and

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,950
that's why you've seen a lot of these

00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:52,820
positions come up as VP of diversity and

00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:59,900
inclusion with Google with Apple to be

00:35:52,820 --> 00:36:05,030
the medium between HR management so what

00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:08,480
can we do women can't change the problem

00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:09,420
in the tech community but men you can't

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,829
be the change

00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:17,950
[Applause]

00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:18,250
and I say this because I watched a Tech

00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:20,770
Talk

00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:22,480
and it was about this one guy talked

00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:24,790
about how domestic violence domestic

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,490
violence can be the change but it has to

00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:32,380
be men to do the changing and it goes it

00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:35,079
goes with all all communities right now

00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:37,869
in the companies for technology we are

00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:40,210
huge and I'm telling you right now what

00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:41,980
technology is going through like we're

00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:43,869
changing the world right now we're

00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:49,660
setting the standards and as you can see

00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:52,540
where media is holding tech responsible

00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:54,790
and so we know I know for a fact

00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:57,460
Walmart is having some issues they ain't

00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:59,140
saying it and it's and I've seen

00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:01,510
articles about it and there's other

00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:03,849
companies besides that they're having

00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:05,680
issues but guess what tech companies are

00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:07,690
being in one hell responsible so now we

00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:11,799
have to be the one making the change and

00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:15,010
so I'm saying this there's men all y'all

00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:18,400
out there y'all work on a team and y'all

00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:20,079
know that if you're all men or women by

00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,780
just putting one woman in the middle of

00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:26,440
that team's that changed the numbers to

00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:29,619
your company and so that's where I'm

00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:33,849
trying to reach out to y'all to say you

00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:36,309
know think about putting that woman of

00:37:33,849 --> 00:37:39,240
technology in there always think about

00:37:36,309 --> 00:37:42,160
to always think about unconscious bias

00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:44,140
always remember that we all have it

00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,480
there's never going to change but then

00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:49,660
just by thinking about just putting that

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:52,420
one female that one women software

00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:54,460
engineer in the mix can totally change

00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:58,780
your respective you got to also remember

00:37:54,460 --> 00:38:04,000
that y'all need us we gave birth to

00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:07,990
y'all we're your sisters your mother

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:11,740
your wife your daughter and I know for a

00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:14,589
fact I have met many of the old man who

00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:17,920
said if one person was to hurt their

00:38:14,589 --> 00:38:23,740
daughter yah well berserk

00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:25,600
and so think about how you talk to women

00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,710
at your job because y'all don't realize

00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:30,370
what you're saying you're really don't

00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:32,110
yes I mean there's things like it's cool

00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:34,480
if it was me I laughed it off and say

00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:38,290
you dude you know you shouldn't say that

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,520
right but is that awareness that you

00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:42,820
have to think about what you're saying

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:46,300
and what you're doing and you need to be

00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:48,160
our advocate you know your need to start

00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,270
if you see something wrong when you see

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,760
something that you think it's

00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:53,440
disrespectful or you see how she how she

00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,620
look or how she feels about it don't

00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,030
need to say something you know um a lot

00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,980
of times you know I mean you're around

00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:01,660
one of the guys and around the guy y'all

00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:03,880
think it's cool but just remember even

00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:06,700
if it's just all the guys it's still not

00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,290
cool you'll still say yo you know you

00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,670
should say that even though you know

00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:13,660
it's funny but you shouldn't say that

00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:16,600
anyway it's also think about how you can

00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:18,820
help us because we can't not do anything

00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:22,000
we cannot change anything unless you're

00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:24,730
we have your support you know cuz women

00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,220
yeah we can we can fight we can argue we

00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:34,810
can March and you see what happened when

00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:38,320
we had the March and happen okay

00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:41,350
let's go back to work so let's be let's

00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,960
do that let's all work together so if

00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:46,360
you're if anything you're need if you're

00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,250
looking for women to come into your

organization reach out to women occult

00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,930
reach out to the community there's

that can help y'all put those women in

00:39:55,510 --> 00:40:03,610
there and so I want to say need for you

00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:05,290
to follow me in my adventures I got tech
