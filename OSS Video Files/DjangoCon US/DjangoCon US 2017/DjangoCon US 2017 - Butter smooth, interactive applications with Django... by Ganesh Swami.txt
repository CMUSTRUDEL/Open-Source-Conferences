	DjangoCon US 2017 - Butter smooth, interactive applications with Django and Websockets by Ganesh Swami

Web applications have changed significantly over the years â€“ from simple static pages, to sprinkling interactiveness with JQuery/AJAX, to full dynamic single page apps. Through each evolution, weâ€™re adding more complexity, more data and more asynchronous behavior to our applications.

In this new world, where does the synchronous nature of Djangoâ€™s request-response cycle fit in?

My talk will focus on the topics around asynchronous Django applications. Iâ€™ll be sharing some lessons we learnt while building and scaling an interactive web application within the confines of Django and django-channels.

This topic is interesting because thereâ€™s been a lot of interest with meteor-like frameworks that have synchronized state between the frontend and backend. My intention is to show the audience that you can accomplish the same end-result with Django, without the need to learn and deploy a brand new framework.

An outline I have in mind:

What does asynchrony mean, and why you need it.

Traditional methods of achieving asynchrony (delayed jobs using worker queues like celery, long-polling for messaging, etc.)

Why django-channels changes the game.

How to architect your state.

What are the available options for deployment.

Gotchas, and what to do when things go wrong.

Just a basic knowledge of Django is required, as the topics are transferable to other frameworks. We did not have to monkey-patch any of the drivers to achieve asynchrony, so what youâ€™ll learn at my talk will apply cleanly to a stock Django.
