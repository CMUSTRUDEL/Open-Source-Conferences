	DjangoCon US 2017 - Programming Post-Progeny: A New Parent's Perspective by Jacinda Shelly

When my daughter appeared on the scene in 2017, my life was turned upside down.

As I was returning to work, I found that previous strategies for managing my time weren’t up to snuff and I needed to create new ones if I was to be effective at my craft. No longer did I have 15 minutes to “get in the zone” - I needed to get things done in any time available. I learned to carve milestones out of minutes (sometimes) and will share what did (and didn’t) work for me.

I also share stories about my general journey of becoming a parent that may be helpful to anyone thinking about becoming a parent (or just wondering what it might be like!).

Or you could just come to the talk for the cute baby pictures - they make everyone smile!

[Music]

and thank you all for coming this is a

00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:31,329
bit of a different talk for me so bear

00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:32,680
with me all right so I'm just in de and

00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:35,350
this is Aida

00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:39,610
she's also with us in the audience today

00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:43,390
because leaving for five days is still a

00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:45,640
bit challenging welcome to programming

00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,710
after progeny a talk that is part time

00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,000
management part encouragement of

00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,670
flexible work arrangements and

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,550
definitely excuse for us to all enjoy

00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,870
cute baby pictures together first I'd

00:00:54,550 --> 00:01:00,430
like to thank Heather and Jeff for

00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:02,140
taking my daughter and holding her if if

00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:05,770
that changed she changes she may end up

00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,939
on stage at some point as well I'd also

00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,860
like to thank the organizers for

00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:10,930
accepting this talk this isn't the first

00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,659
talk that I've given it a conference but

00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:16,390
it's certainly the most personal my

00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:18,429
previous talks more used to giving talks

00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:21,189
with titles like connecting patients to

00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:23,950
doctors in real-time delving into the

00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:29,079
Django admin admin performance talks

00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:30,609
ipython Tulio programmable video however

00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:33,520
despite the fact that I am NOT a

00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:35,350
childcare expert and my anecdotes are

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,450
not students assist eclis significant

00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,920
data I feel it's important for us to

00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,319
share the rest of our lives with each

00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,600
other because we are people not just

00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:45,759
programmers and it would be foolish to

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,969
think that we work in isolation from

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,469
other important parts of our lives there

00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:52,209
are also many things that I acknowledged

00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:54,639
as being important before I had a child

00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:57,219
but that still blindsided me even though

00:01:54,639 --> 00:02:00,100
I thought I was prepared so if nothing

00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:03,279
else I hope this talks reaches a parent

00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:06,700
out there or a someday parent or someone

00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:08,500
who works with parents and lets them

00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,869
know that they're a people with similar

00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:14,380
feelings and that they are probably not

00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:16,599
alone now before we begin I'd like to

00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,910
set expectations just a bit first this

00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:22,090
is a personal story talk to other

00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,770
parents and you'll hear as many other

00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:28,990
stories as there are parents

00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:30,760
and as there are children this is the

00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:33,850
things that have worked for me are not

00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,890
things that I'm saying everyone she can

00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:38,230
or should do people have different

00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:40,090
feelings about children and different

00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,130
feelings about parenting heck I wonder

00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:45,910
on an almost daily basis if I'm screwing

00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:47,980
this up and might do things differently

00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:51,900
in the future or if I could go back in

00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,900
time but this is where I'm at right now

00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:01,810
my daughter entered the worlds about two

00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:04,580
weeks late so she was right on par with

00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:07,880
programming even then nothing ever

00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,920
arrives on time we had actually

00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,410
struggled with infertility a pregnancy

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,090
loss and long induction all topics for

00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:17,140
another time but that I'm happy to share

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:19,970
more about with anyone who has questions

00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:22,340
and we were delighted she was here I was

00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:24,530
exhausted and needed to heal but

00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:28,100
incredibly happy I had started maternity

00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:29,750
leave a few days earlier when I had gone

00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,370
to the hospital and was looking forward

00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:34,840
to time to recover and to get to know

00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:37,220
this brand little new little person so

00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:42,590
it was time for expectations to meet

00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:43,880
reality before I had a child I expected

00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,290
that it would be tough I knew plenty of

00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,269
other parents I had three younger

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,790
siblings I'd spent quite a bit of time

00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:51,200
around babies I thought I knew what I

00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,459
was getting into I'd done a lot of

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,060
reading oh yeah

00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:57,709
books books are great I knew I would

00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,200
have a small human being who take up an

00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:02,720
awful lot of time but in between diapers

00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:08,420
feedings and nap time I would have some

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,440
time to myself right yeah I know so

00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,049
that's my daughter when she was about

00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,890
four months old

00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:17,209
this is my daughter when she was about

00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:19,790
nine days old the first few months are

00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:23,930
not what you picture when you think

00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:28,340
about babies newborns eat every one to

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:30,919
two hours around the clock they maybe

00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,520
three if you're if you're lucky they

00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:37,930
don't sleep for long stretches of a time

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:41,300
they're actually except in some cases

00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:42,680
physically incapable of doing that there

00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,530
are exceptions just like everything else

00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,539
but most newborns don't sleep for very

00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,910
long at any stretch of the time they

00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:53,750
have stomachs that are about the size of

00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:55,729
I think it was a marble by the end of

00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,979
the first week and they're like this big

00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:59,450
when they're born so they they have to

00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:06,050
eat frequently because they really can't

00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:08,840
eat a lot at any given time and

00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:10,460
and I also thought I have I have 12

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,039
weeks of maternity leave to figure this

00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:15,889
out that's that's plenty of time keep

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,780
that in the back of your mind because I

00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:20,199
have to take a necessary detour on this

00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:23,180
talk and just go through the obligatory

00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,319
US has no guaranteed paid maternity or

00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,289
paternity leave

00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:30,169
we ranked dead last in the OECD in

00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:33,110
company with only Papa New Guinea this

00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:35,509
is a ranking of other countries in the

00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:40,940
OECD and how much paid maternity leave

00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:42,770
they provide it's fantastic that so many

00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:46,340
tech companies have fabulous leave

00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:48,169
policies Google Amazon actually I'm not

00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,270
sure how good Amazon says I think it's

00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:53,419
good but I know Google's Netflix

00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:56,409
Facebook all have great maternity leave

00:05:53,419 --> 00:06:00,199
policies and paternity leave policies

00:05:56,409 --> 00:06:02,270
but that leaves out a whole bunch of

00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:04,190
people and this is not something that

00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:08,960
should be dependent upon employment

00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:11,180
status in 2014 only 13% of US civilian

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:16,370
employees had any access to paid family

00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:19,009
leave the Family Medical Leave Act

00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:22,909
provides 12 weeks of unpaid leave which

00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:28,250
means that after you've given birth you

00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:34,419
have 12 weeks where you may not be fired

00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:37,759
from your position but only 60% or so of

00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:39,880
US workers are actually eligible for the

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,669
Family Medical Leave Act so that means

00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:45,349
40% of people who are employed are not

00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,680
eligible for the Family Medical Leave

00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:48,740
Act

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,650
remember that's unpaid leave so 40% of

00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:54,349
US employees if they had a child would

00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:56,779
not be eligible to take any form of

00:06:54,349 --> 00:07:01,819
leave and have their job be guaranteed

00:06:56,779 --> 00:07:04,039
when they came back additionally the

00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:05,719
World Health Organization recommends six

00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:07,779
months of exclusive breastfeeding with

00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:10,849
one year as a primary nutrition source

00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:15,020
nursing can be hard pumping can be

00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:17,150
harder and good parental leave policies

00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:20,530
make this easier

00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:23,230
it's hard to even think you have

00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:27,470
breastfeeding figured out at 12 weeks

00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:30,169
and going back to work at that point

00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,850
first some people is easy and for a lot

00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:33,680
of other people is hard the u.s. does

00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:38,030
not do a good job of supporting those

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:40,910
people this is not the main thrust of my

00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:43,669
talk but I felt like I needed to include

00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:46,040
it because it's something that we don't

00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:49,100
do well here in the US and that we

00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:54,169
should do better so back to my personal

00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:58,330
story and not statistics here are a few

00:07:54,169 --> 00:08:02,270
more details about my expectations I

00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:03,650
expected that 12 weeks would be plenty

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:05,990
of time to figure out everything I

00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,030
needed to know and that I would be ready

00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:11,590
to go back to work at that time and that

00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,590
she would be ready to go to daycare I

00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:16,760
expected that by 12 weeks she wouldn't

00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:20,530
be sleeping well but that we would have

00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:24,229
started figuring something out I

00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:26,030
expected that she would go to childcare

00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:29,000
and that she might be a little unhappy

00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,750
with unfamiliar caretakers but that she

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,029
would adjust

00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:36,909
I expected that pumping would be easy I

00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:40,159
was wrong

00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:41,180
reality 12 weeks is short this is

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,589
actually a picture of ADA from when she

00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:48,380
was 13 weeks old at 13 weeks babies are

00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:52,459
still generally immobile most of them

00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:53,930
can't even roll over yet and are only

00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:59,600
starting to develop reasonable head

00:08:53,930 --> 00:09:01,339
control the other reality is that babies

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,140
are individuals and all of those

00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:06,380
expectations I had about how she would

00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:08,270
do with other people how she would sleep

00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,350
how I would do all of the things that

00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,370
the book said I should do and that

00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:13,850
things would turn out fine

00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:16,430
it didn't happen from day one she had a

00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:19,580
vocal personality she hated car seats

00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:22,310
swaddles and strollers which leaves out

00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:24,709
pretty much all of the sleep strategies

00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:27,350
that they tell you about it would take

00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:28,640
40 minutes to an hour to get her

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,959
swaddled and down and then she would

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,950
sleep for about 20 minutes in the

00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:35,620
swaddle

00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:37,820
and wake up screaming this meant that a

00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:40,040
lot of the things that you typically

00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,690
hear from people like have you heard

00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,070
have you driven them around in a car oh

00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,960
yes we tried that that's the baby

00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:49,550
equivalent of how you restarted your

00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:51,830
computer she also had silent reflex

00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:55,130
which is essentially baby heartburn

00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:58,070
except that you don't actually see the

00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,910
spit up as much and she refused a bottle

00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,890
for a long time

00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:03,920
none of these voted well for a seamless

00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:06,020
transition back to work and as you can

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,550
see from this early photo for her

00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,550
strollers were great for carrying

00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:12,590
everything except the baby she often

00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:15,320
would only fall asleep if he went on a

00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:17,300
long walk and in contrast to how she

00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,990
slept if we tried swaddling her and

00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:22,970
putting her in a crib or a bassinet she

00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:29,360
would sleep for a couple hours at a time

00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:31,280
in a carrier no problem the other

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:37,220
reality was that I felt more conflicted

00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:40,070
than I expected at 12 weeks I didn't

00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:44,450
feel ready to just hand her off to

00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:50,230
daycare I love my job but I wanted to be

00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:53,090
there for this and for this and for this

00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:59,570
but like I said I I really love my job

00:10:53,090 --> 00:11:01,160
so how could I make this work well the

00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:06,650
engineering me was like okay well this

00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:08,030
is this part of it I would sit on a yoga

00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,620
ball which was one of the ways that we

00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:12,100
could get her to fall asleep was

00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,960
bouncing on a yoga ball in a carrier and

00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,700
work on my laptop this is actually I

00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,050
think when I was still on maternity

00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,050
leave in our chat program

00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:32,829
all right and she can join hey there she

00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:39,640
still seems to think that I'm an okay

00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:43,089
person what a judge of character so this

00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:47,490
I think was about two months in so I had

00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:52,300
to try a bunch of different things first

00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:54,940
remote work and I've been very fortunate

00:11:52,300 --> 00:12:00,160
to have a flexible work environment and

00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:03,269
manager and that is something that I'm

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:06,930
strongly advocating for in this talk

00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:09,490
flexible work environments help everyone

00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:11,350
especially with retaining talent and

00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:15,670
I'll reiterate this point at the end but

00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:18,160
if my only choice had been go back to

00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:22,540
commuting to work five days a week and

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:25,720
be in an office at 12 weeks the decision

00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:29,050
would have been a whole lot harder I was

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:32,829
able to continue working remotely for as

00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:35,290
long as I felt I needed to after my

00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:37,360
leave was over this gave me more time to

00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:40,120
adjust and figure out what would work

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,040
for me longer term I didn't feel any

00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,519
pressure to return to the office before

00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:48,820
I was ready and this is something that I

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:54,730
am very very grateful for and that is

00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:56,589
something I I just can't express how

00:12:54,730 --> 00:13:02,140
fortunate I feel to have been able to do

00:12:56,589 --> 00:13:05,350
that and I want to strongly advocate if

00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:07,660
you are an employer have policies in

00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:11,620
place like this and you will retain

00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:15,899
employees I also was fortunate to have

00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:19,240
some family support who from in-laws who

00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:21,790
live nearby so they were able to

00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:25,600
actually watch eight a a couple days a

00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:26,829
week and provide a better transition

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,130
because she was familiar with them

00:13:26,829 --> 00:13:29,130
already

00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:36,990
and last thing that I would say from my

00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:40,769
story is day care is not necessarily the

00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:43,350
only option it wasn't realistic for me

00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:47,189
to especially as ADA got older and

00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:49,230
didn't just sleep all the time it wasn't

00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:51,360
realistic for me to only work while she

00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:54,059
slept she was getting more active and

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,959
needed more attention but I was still

00:13:54,059 --> 00:14:00,300
able to work during her afternoon naps

00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:03,240
we looked at daycares full and part-time

00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,749
in the Bay Area and really around the

00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,939
country

00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:08,069
those are pretty expensive and have long

00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:31,259
waiting lists so we also looked at the

00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:38,639
cost we looked at the cost of no she

00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:40,949
can't see it it's good consider whether

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,319
having a part-time babysitter or a nanny

00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:46,529
who comes consistently is something that

00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:48,300
is an option because for me and for

00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:51,360
other parents that I've talked to the

00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,679
cost can actually be equivalent or for

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,439
us it was significantly less than

00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:58,110
full-time day care I was able to work

00:14:55,439 --> 00:15:00,629
from home and have someone come and

00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:05,459
watch her in the mornings three days a

00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:08,100
week so what does this look like today I

00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:09,870
work from home three days a week with

00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:16,019
part-time childcare in the mornings on

00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:20,670
those days so I get up there ready hand

00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:22,759
her off I work upstairs and someone else

00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:25,589
watches her for that time period in the

00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:28,290
afternoon I get a little bit of time

00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:32,399
with her and work during her afternoon

00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:33,209
nap I commute to the office two days a

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,350
week now

00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:38,189
that will probably continue to change

00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,029
like I said I worked during her

00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:42,510
afternoon nap

00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:45,110
I also work evenings

00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:48,270
to bedtime and on weekends if needed I

00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:51,420
don't advocate anyone work on weekends

00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:53,760
in general but if that's but that's

00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:59,370
what's been working for me to be able to

00:15:53,760 --> 00:16:00,690
spend time with my daughter and this

00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:03,930
evolved over time and continues to

00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:05,190
change I started only going into the

00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,350
office one day a week when I felt

00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:09,240
comfortable I moved to two days when I

00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:12,120
felt comfortable with that at some point

00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:15,390
she probably will go into full-time

00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,660
childcare but it's something that we're

00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:23,580
taking a day at a time

00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:25,620
and that still seems hard so how do how

00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,480
do I actually do it so this is probably

00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:30,540
the slide that a lot of you were hoping

00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:33,150
to see is some time management tips that

00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:35,010
I've come across the first one is I

00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:42,180
can't do it all I have put some things

00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:48,900
on hold I I realized that this is a

00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:50,580
temporary thing and that things will

00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:54,600
change he's not gonna be this size

00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:57,600
forever five months ago she couldn't

00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:01,680
even crawl so this all goes by very

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:04,680
quickly second thing is you have to

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,839
sleep I I relied heavily on caffeine

00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:09,390
before I got pregnant cut it out

00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:10,380
almost completely because you're you're

00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,250
not supposed to drink caffeine when

00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,440
you're pregnant

00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:16,020
also with nursing the last thing that

00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:18,510
anyone wants is a caffeinated baby

00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:21,050
so I still don't drink much caffeine I

00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:25,500
had to find something that let me sleep

00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:28,110
and when I was only getting when she was

00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:32,670
four days old I was very adamant about

00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:37,110
the baby will never sleep with us and I

00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:39,000
learned how to do it more I learned some

00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,770
things about doing it more safely the

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,620
official recommendation from the

00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:46,380
American Academy of Pediatrics is to

00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:48,630
never Co sleep but they do they did

00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:53,000
revise the recommendations and say that

00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:57,020
if you do they provide the way to do it

00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,020
or at least more safely

00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:04,130
and as you know things never go quite as

00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:08,750
planned

00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:14,150
good kids see that's and the last point

00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:16,310
on this is uh be kind to yourself

00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:21,700
because things don't always go according

00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:23,990
to plan and having help is important

00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:26,170
learning to get in the zone fast this is

00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:30,350
probably something that anyone can use

00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:32,420
regardless of parenting status taking

00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:34,250
notes all the time and planning upfront

00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:36,230
is something that I do much better now I

00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:41,960
thought it was important before I became

00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:45,800
a parent but now if I'm trying to get in

00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:49,280
the zone and I know I only have two

00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:52,850
hours to work I've developed strategies

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:55,160
for keeping track of what I've been

00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:59,680
working on so the basic way that works

00:18:55,160 --> 00:19:04,210
is matching work just to the situation

00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:06,680
what I bit what I've been doing is

00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:08,930
instead of tackling a coding problem

00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:13,660
like I might have in the past where I

00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:16,790
would write down a general outline and

00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:20,390
map out what I wanted to do but maybe

00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:23,480
leave out some details I now map out in

00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:30,350
much more detail up front what I want to

00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:32,120
do and don't try and I try not to do it

00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:36,980
as I'm coding which is always good

00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:40,460
practice but when I had more more slack

00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:42,830
time I guess I would put it I I could

00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:45,740
get away with not planning upfront as

00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:48,560
much now in order to get in the zone

00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:50,780
very quickly I have to have broken

00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:53,030
things up into very small chunks so that

00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,650
I'm able to say okay this is the next

00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,970
small chunk that I need to work on in

00:19:54,650 --> 00:20:00,080
order to accomplish this much bigger

00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:02,540
project so I break things up into tiny

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,070
chunks and work on those when I have

00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,050
time anticipating that there will be

00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,930
interruptions and breaks and flows and

00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:09,320
this is also potentially a good tip for

00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:11,450
anyone

00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,970
who works in an open office environment

00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:15,919
or a place where you might get

00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:17,840
interrupted more frequently than you

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,360
would like as a programmer because let's

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,130
face it we don't all live in ideal

00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:25,850
conditions we don't all work in ideal

00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:29,029
conditions regardless of whether you

00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:30,970
have a child or not I've also started

00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:37,759
using something called personal convent

00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:42,230
which breaks things up into to do do

00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:44,720
first and done and I have a tool that's

00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:47,570
a board where I break out all the tasks

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,000
that I need to do and only work on one

00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:53,960
thing at a time I used to be very bad at

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:59,720
multitasking and I'm not perfect even

00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:01,220
today but this talk is it doesn't have

00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,840
enough time to go into the details of

00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:06,679
personal conv but it's been very helpful

00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:08,570
for me in terms of working as a strategy

00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:12,379
for keeping track of what I need to do

00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:15,350
and getting it to a done place it

00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:16,639
concentrates mostly on minimizing the

00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:20,480
number of things that you have in

00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:22,850
progress so don't multitask I've

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,409
actually been really surprised at when I

00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:27,350
started taking some of these time

00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:30,230
management things seriously and not

00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:34,629
multitasking at how much I was able to

00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:38,480
get done I haven't found myself to be

00:21:34,629 --> 00:21:42,379
significantly worse off last thing is be

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,059
present when I'm with my family I do my

00:21:42,379 --> 00:21:46,429
best to concentrate my energy on being

00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:49,279
there when I'm working or giving a talk

00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:51,590
I do my best to focus on that I can only

00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:54,009
do one thing at a time so you notice the

00:21:51,590 --> 00:22:00,080
two pictures they're out side by side

00:21:54,009 --> 00:22:04,789
they overlapped because you can't do

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:09,019
more than one thing at a time so what

00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:12,529
are the takeaways from this one I am in

00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:14,629
st. grateful for what I have and wanted

00:22:12,529 --> 00:22:16,549
to take the time to share my story with

00:22:14,629 --> 00:22:19,669
others in case it might help someone

00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:21,049
else out there everyone wants to

00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:22,570
contribute in this world I don't know

00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:25,889
anyone

00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:32,289
who really just wants to sit back and

00:22:25,889 --> 00:22:35,019
let things happen to them we need to

00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:40,409
figure out ways to make it possible for

00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:43,720
everyone to contribute and having

00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:47,470
flexible work schedules and encouraging

00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,909
people that if you're programming that's

00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:52,239
a career field where that can be more

00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:55,179
possible so if you want to have a more

00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:58,330
flexible work environment consider

00:22:55,179 --> 00:23:00,989
programming flexible work schedules

00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:03,460
retain talent so if you're an employer

00:23:00,989 --> 00:23:05,979
see about giving your employees that

00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:08,320
option regardless of their career fields

00:23:05,979 --> 00:23:12,369
it's not possible for every job I know

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:16,059
that and not everyone wants that either

00:23:12,369 --> 00:23:18,519
but if you do want that then look at

00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:19,809
being a programmer as a career field

00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:22,960
where there are more opportunities for

00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:26,889
that and adults are individuals and so

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,779
are babies some of them require a little

00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:35,889
bit more special handling than other

00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:38,080
and lastly lest anyone think that I have

00:23:35,889 --> 00:23:38,739
it all figured out and altogether I

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,470
don't

00:23:38,739 --> 00:23:43,869
I have awful days where I wonder if I

00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:45,279
can keep everything going and I question

00:23:43,869 --> 00:23:50,649
whether I'm doing the right thing for my

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:52,720
family or myself or for ADA but I keep

00:23:50,649 --> 00:23:54,549
going and I try and do the best I can

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,070
every day and that's all any of us can

00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:59,470
do so thank you

00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:02,289
you can find me on Twitter and under at

00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:04,330
Jacinda Shelley I'm also at linked on

00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:09,159
LinkedIn and github and every other

00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:11,019
social media outlet I think my company

00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:12,970
is also hiring so feel free to reach out

00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:16,109
if you're interested and at this point

00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:16,109
I'd love to answer questions

00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:26,210
yeah so just while I was waiting lab

00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:28,070
sorry how many times if you ended up

00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,840
having to deal with say you know baby

00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:31,480
related things like projectile vomit on

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,980
the keyboard and things like that so

00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:37,070
fortunately no projectile vomit on the

00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:41,840
keyboard that's not her reflux was

00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:43,960
silent so most of her spit up was as a

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:50,809
parent I have dealt with projectile poop

00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:52,309
though but I think the the thing that's

00:24:50,809 --> 00:24:56,059
gotten on the keyboard more often is

00:24:52,309 --> 00:25:01,280
milk and everything else just goes on

00:24:56,059 --> 00:25:03,200
the floor thank you so much for this

00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,370
talking for bringing ADA with you it was

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,740
really fun to get to spend a little bit

00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:08,090
of time with her my question is is just

00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,159
kind of a more general question about

00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,870
the the second shift that a lot of women

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,730
wind up having to work you know we work

00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:15,530
our day jobs and then we come home and

00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:16,730
we do our evening jobs as well and I

00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:18,049
know whenever you're working remotely

00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:19,220
and you have your baby with you then

00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,840
there's probably sort of a lot of

00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:24,440
overlap and back and forth with that

00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,850
shift but I don't even know that I have

00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,590
just kind of a specific question other

00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:30,919
than just do you have general thoughts

00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:33,230
on being a mom who who is also working

00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:35,000
full-time and splitting those duties

00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:39,530
with your with your partner and kind of

00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:41,450
that second shift in general probably no

00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:44,240
tips that haven't already been spouted

00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:45,890
communication is key like figure out

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,490
what responsibilities you want to divvy

00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:52,700
up if you're both working full-time and

00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:55,970
and you can't afford it and you both

00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:57,830
agree to getting help for non-baby

00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,950
related activities or baby related

00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:02,600
activities and paying for it even if

00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,950
it's short term and you're like okay

00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,200
we'll do this for the first year and

00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:08,630
then not do it afterwards can be

00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:14,710
insanely helpful there was actually a

00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:18,020
study oh there was actually a study that

00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:22,909
was done recently where I think they

00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:26,570
paid people 40 dollars versus just

00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:28,659
paying for them to have $40 for takeout

00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:29,919
or just paying for takeout or pay

00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:34,779
for someone to clean their house for

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:37,210
them and the people who had the had the

00:26:34,779 --> 00:26:39,970
service or the takeout or the house

00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:42,519
cleans we're happier with it than the

00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:45,099
people who just got the $40 so the

00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:47,759
conclusion that they drew from that and

00:26:45,099 --> 00:26:51,580
all studies are unreliable is that

00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:53,830
people under value how much they would

00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:56,999
appreciate having some type of service

00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:59,139
like that I feel a little weird actually

00:26:56,999 --> 00:27:02,169
recommending that because so many people

00:26:59,139 --> 00:27:04,389
have different circumstances and you

00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:07,779
know that's not possible for a lot of

00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:12,009
people but if you're both working full

00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:15,220
time then that and you can that's

00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:17,289
something you can consider I know there

00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:20,559
are a lot of people aren't have to be

00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:22,299
shy just want to thank you so much for

00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,789
sharing your personal story with us I

00:27:22,299 --> 00:27:26,440
think it's really brave and it's just

00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:30,580
awesome that you have the confidence to

00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:31,989
do that my question about being a new

00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:34,599
parent and trying to work at the same

00:27:31,989 --> 00:27:36,340
time it is have you noticed that you've

00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:38,830
come up with more creative problem

00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:42,970
creative solutions to problems in your

00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:48,700
work now being a parents and has it

00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:52,450
impacted your creativity it's kind of a

00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:54,249
vague question but maybe being forced to

00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:56,440
take some more breaks has helped with

00:27:54,249 --> 00:27:58,509
that also because I've been taking sleep

00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:05,950
more seriously because I don't have the

00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:08,619
option to make it up with caffeine that

00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:10,059
may be contributing as well to me being

00:28:08,619 --> 00:28:11,769
more creative I think I undergo you'd

00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:13,330
actually I know I under gal you'd the

00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:20,039
importance of sleep before I had a child

00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:20,039
slowly absolutely thank you something

00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,190
next okay and that's it and thank you

00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:32,280
very much thank you all very much

00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:32,280
