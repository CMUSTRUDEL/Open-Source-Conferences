	DjangoCon US 2017 - Flourishing FLOSS: Making Your Project Successful by Anna Ossowski

You maintain an Open Source project with great code? Yet your project isnâ€™t succeeding in the ways you want? Maybe youâ€™re struggling with funding or documentation? Or you just canâ€™t find new contributors and youâ€™re drowning in issues and pull requests? Open Source is made up of many components and we are often better-trained in methods for writing good code, than in methods for succeeding in the other dimensions we want our project to grow. In this talk weâ€™ll explore the different components of an Open Source project and how they work together. After this talk youâ€™ll be well-equipped with a ideas and strategies for growing, cultivating, and nourishing your Open Source project.

For your project to succeed, all of its non-code components must be well-maintained. What are these different components and what methods can we learn to maintain them?

Build real relationships with your sponsors and determine ways how both sides can benefit from this relationship, donâ€™t just ask people for money.

Establish a good communication system with your contributors: Keep them informed, listen to their feedback and input, make them feel heard.

Thank the people who worked on ticket triage or marketing, not just those who wrote code, in your release notes.

Make it easy for new contributors to get started: Write and maintain good documentation, answer questions in a friendly and timely manner.

Market and evangelize in the right places and at the right time: Give conference talks, organize sprints, keep your projectâ€™s Twitter account active, always curate new and interesting content on your blog or website.

Implement a Code of Conduct and enforce it if needed: Make your project a safe space to contribute for everyone.

With these methods and a half-dozen others, youâ€™ll handle beautifully all the components your project needs to succeed.

00:00:14,209 --> 00:00:22,490
all right everyone

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:24,720
it's 3:10 so I'm going to get started I

00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:27,240
hope you've been enjoying Jing account

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,680
so far and this is my third time that I

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,929
get to speak at jang ik-hun and i'm

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,730
super honored i don't know you had a

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:33,330
chance to see Alicia's keynote this

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,250
morning

00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:38,010
I love the keynote I got very teary eyed

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:41,489
and it reminded me of why I love this

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:45,420
community so much so thank you for being

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:48,540
here and listening to me today I'm here

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,839
today to talk to you all about making

00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,430
your open-source project successful

00:00:50,839 --> 00:00:55,170
first I would like to introduce myself a

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,080
lot of you might know me but some might

00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,850
not my name is Anna I'm from Germany I

00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,580
have a degree in English and Catholic

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,670
theology that's why you saw Pope Francis

00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,380
and William Shakespeare right here but

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,630
about three years ago I got involved in

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,240
Python and Django and started to teach

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,880
myself coding and I noticed that I like

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,320
code but I also really like people so I

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,140
kind of like working at the intersection

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,110
of both and I currently work at elastic

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,760
and developer relations and they just

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,030
started there at last month so that's

00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,740
pretty cool in my free time I'm also

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,990
involved in a few other tech related

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,480
things and PyCon u.s. open spaces chair

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,040
I'm Django Khan diversity chair and I'm

00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:40,200
one of the leaders of the pie ladies

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:42,270
remote group and to start off my talk

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,150
first of all I have to give a big shout

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,310
out to Tom Christie Tom Christie is the

00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:49,140
creator of Django rest framework some of

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,780
you may know him some of you may use

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,760
Django rest framework I had the chance

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,260
to work with him as the community and

00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,930
operations manager of Django rest

00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:00,090
framework and most of what I know about

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,540
open source comes from my time on

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:06,390
working with Tom and Tom is one of the

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,280
most humble brilliant and kind people I

00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,649
know and I'm sad that he can't be here

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,290
today but I just wanted to give him a

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:16,019
big shout out before I start I would

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:19,310
like to do a small informal survey who

00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:22,379
have you contribute to open source

00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:24,040
awesome who have your open source

00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:27,440
project maintainer

00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,480
okay couple and who have you have not

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,420
contributed yet but are thinking about

00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,250
contributing to open source okay you

00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,510
should definitely come to the Sprint's

00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,200
if you're interested in contributing

00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:41,599
okay awesome cool before I start I would

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,030
like to first take a little bit of time

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,830
to explain what open source is I don't

00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,680
know about you but when I when people

00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:51,230
ask me what do you do I never know how

00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,569
to explain it like I said I just started

00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,760
a new job and my sister he's usually not

00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:57,709
very interested in what I do just ask me

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,260
what what do you actually do for work

00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:02,569
and I just send her my job description

00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:04,459
because I had no idea how to explain it

00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:07,250
to her she's an English teacher so she's

00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:08,900
not a techie person so I found this

00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,510
definition which is a little bit on the

00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,980
longer side please bear with me but it's

00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,629
really good so I would like to read it

00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,730
to you

00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:19,610
source code refers to the code written

00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:21,950
to operate nearly anything your computer

00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:24,110
software your telephone an ATM machine

00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:26,090
even many of your household appliances

00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:28,459
have software written for them that

00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,049
allows them to operate and software that

00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:33,260
allows you to interact with those

00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:35,329
devices when code is open source it

00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,910
means that anyone is able to read those

00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:40,609
lines of code reuse that code and in

00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:42,980
some cases modify the code to improve

00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:45,019
upon it what you're permitted to do with

00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:48,349
the code depends on the software license

00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:50,599
under which it was released for the vast

00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:53,660
majority of the history of software this

00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:55,639
code was never seen by anyone except

00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,250
those who wrote it it was generally

00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:00,410
considered proprietary and part of a

00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:03,139
companies or organizations intellectual

00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:05,480
property this was a very long definition

00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:08,030
so the somnus app open source means that

00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,609
code is publicly accessible it is

00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:12,739
reusable depending on the license and it

00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:16,549
is modifiable depending on the license

00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:18,769
and now we know what open source means

00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:21,289
but what exactly are open source

00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:23,090
software communities I found another

00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:24,889
definition which is again a little bit

00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:27,680
on the longer side but I promise this is

00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:30,320
the last definition and then we'll move

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,599
on to different things because the code

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,270
is freely viewable and available to

00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:37,700
modify in most cases it provides an

00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:40,520
excellent base on which people can write

00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,110
new or add-on to existing projects but

00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,210
like most things in life when it comes

00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:47,000
to getting things done it is far more

00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:48,800
effective to work in groups the power of

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,500
many is far greater than the power of

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,270
one an open-source software community is

00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,430
made up of anywhere from a handful of

00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,710
people to hundreds or even thousands of

00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,690
people who are working collectively to

00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,570
improve the functionality of a piece of

00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:04,310
software the contributors and users in

00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,860
this community do anything from

00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:09,320
answering questions to writing code to

00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,690
working on documentation finding and

00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:16,550
fixing bugs and soliciting or providing

00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:18,320
feedback about how the software works do

00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:21,520
any of you have any guesses on where

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,980
these definitions are from any guesses

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,780
it's a little bit of a trick question

00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,850
they're actually from elastics company

00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:32,750
internal documentation we do a lot of

00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:35,090
open-source at elastic and elastic

00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,590
kindly offered to pay for my trip here

00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:39,530
so I have to mention that and that was

00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:42,650
kind of the deal but I actually think

00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:44,480
those definitions are really good if you

00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,550
have any other shorter definitions that

00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,580
you really like that explain to someone

00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:51,050
not technical what open source is please

00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,650
sent them my way I would love to read

00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:57,110
them and when we think open source most

00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:59,000
of us think code and code definitely is

00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:01,760
an important part of open source project

00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,220
but it's not the only part you can have

00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,650
the most amazing part code of the world

00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,810
but if you neglect all these other parts

00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:11,900
that you can see on my slide then your

00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,820
project is likely to fail your project

00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,710
may need funding your project has a

00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,110
community that needs to be nurtured your

00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:21,140
project needs marketing your project

00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:22,850
needs good documentation your project

00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,710
needs people to work on ticket triage

00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,930
all of these things have nothing to do

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:29,420
with writing code but they're as

00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,520
important as working on code and you're

00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,410
going to hear me say that a lot because

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,560
it's really important to me we tend to

00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,970
praise the people who write code but we

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,920
don't praise the people who write the

00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,750
dogs or we don't praise the people who

00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,370
work on social media but though all

00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,950
those components interact with each

00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,360
other and are equally important more

00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,600
about that later here are a couple

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,730
examples of open source

00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,210
that I like just to clarify this a

00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:57,430
little bit Django is open source source

00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,320
Django rest framework Python is also

00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,540
open source and elasticsearch is

00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,670
actually open source as well you will

00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:06,490
see that a lot of tech companies out

00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:08,530
there either maintain their own open

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:12,460
source projects or used other open

00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:15,700
source projects for their work and some

00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:17,590
companies out there pretty much use open

00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:20,080
like we said open source code is freaked

00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:22,180
out that is out there to reuse depending

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,550
on the license so you could say that

00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:27,010
some companies make money off of using

00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:29,160
free projects because other people spend

00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:33,160
free time on maintaining and developing

00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:35,350
these projects so let's get down to the

00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,080
nitty-gritty right away it's important

00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:40,480
for open source users especially for

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,820
companies using open source projects to

00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,590
give back to open source and this can be

00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,510
done by having the developers work on

00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,850
code and documentation during their work

00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:51,970
hours but oftentimes that's not enough

00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:55,060
most open source projects need money and

00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:56,770
Tom Christie that's a lot of awesome

00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,840
things with Django rest framework and

00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:00,760
Tom Cruise is actually able to work on

00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,430
Django rest framework full time as his

00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:06,190
job because he has established a very

00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,630
successful fund-raising model most of my

00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,190
time at Django rest framework when I

00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,150
worked there was actually spent on

00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:13,090
fundraising

00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:15,190
Heather Luna our sponsorship chair here

00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:17,440
Django Khan wrote a really awesome blog

00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:19,780
post on her personal blog kind of

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,540
explaining her journey about into Django

00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:25,660
Khan and she said that it takes about 70

00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:28,030
emails to get one or two sponsors so you

00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:31,960
can say that see that fundraising is a

00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:33,460
lot of work but if you think about it

00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,380
it's a win-win situation

00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,940
Tom gets to do what he loves he gets to

00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,950
work on Django rest framework full time

00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,660
and the people using Django rest

00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:45,480
framework donate a little bit of money

00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:48,760
back this ranges from 15 to $400 a month

00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,800
if the company you use for you work for

00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,170
uses an open-source project I can only

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,890
encourage you to talk to them you don't

00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:58,510
give back to open-source don't only

00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:01,260
think about it as giving back though

00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:03,360
also think about it as giving forward

00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,920
by supporting open source projects

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,690
financially you make sure that their

00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,960
future development and maintenance is

00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:12,030
sustained imagine that you use an open

00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,240
source project for your product or your

00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:16,050
company and you heavily rely on it

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,480
imagine what would happen if that

00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,970
project wasn't maintained anymore no bug

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,150
fixes no I don't care about your issues

00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:26,460
there weren't any new features there

00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:28,860
it's likely that this would cause a huge

00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:31,380
issue for your product for your project

00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,120
or product at one point so next time

00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,670
that you hesitate about things

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,830
eight-eight giving back to open source

00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,360
create that scenario in your head and if

00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:43,440
it makes you nervous then maybe you

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,060
should give a little bit of money but

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,520
also as an open source project

00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,350
maintainer don't just take someone's

00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,810
money you need to offer them something

00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:54,030
valuable in return build real

00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:56,370
relationships with sponsors and

00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:59,100
determine ways how both of you can

00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:02,640
benefit from this relationship like I

00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:05,010
said fundraising is hard work if you

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,480
have questions about fundraising if you

00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,850
would like to hear more about it I don't

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,860
have time to go into detail here then

00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,690
please find me after my talk or reach

00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:17,010
out to town Christy we're both super

00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:18,750
happy to talk to you more about that one

00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,640
way you can offer sponsor something

00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,070
valuable in return is simply to listen

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,890
to them listen to them at their needs

00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:28,950
and act upon it but also listen to your

00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:30,870
users and contributors and listen to

00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:33,240
their feedback and input and also make

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,250
them feel heard listening can sometimes

00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,160
be uncomfortable because you may hear

00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:40,110
things you don't want to hear but if you

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,910
ask people for feedback and then you

00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:45,000
don't do anything about it then you may

00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:47,100
as well not ask I was involved with an

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,900
open source project where we do where

00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,520
we'd ask people for a feedback but in

00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,830
the end we would only do what the core

00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,660
contributors wanted to do and that led

00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:56,700
to people getting frustrated and not

00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:59,010
contributing anymore and the project

00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:02,100
failed in the end it still exists but

00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:03,780
it's not very successful anymore so if

00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,190
you don't listen to your contributors

00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:11,110
it's likely that your project will fail

00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:13,810
also establish good communication system

00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:17,650
answer people's questions in slack or

00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:19,960
IRC discuss github Twitter anywhere

00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:22,060
don't ignore what they have to say good

00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,890
communication systems are especially

00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:26,260
important if you want to cultivate new

00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:28,180
contributors and you will need they will

00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,580
need a way to reach out it's likely that

00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:32,440
they'll have questions so give them a

00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,660
way that they can reach you if I want to

00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,850
contribute to a project and I get stuck

00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:39,490
and there's no one that I can contact

00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:41,020
it's likely that I will move on to a

00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:44,650
different project which has a better

00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:46,300
support system also be transparent with

00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,680
your contributors let them know what

00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,960
you're working on currently what you'll

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,490
be working on in the future people like

00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,830
to know what's going on

00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:56,710
Tom Christie publishes monthly progress

00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:58,960
reports in which he explains what he's

00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:00,940
working on what he's planning on working

00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,040
on and he also does a really good job

00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:06,060
and breaking down finances and letting

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:09,640
people know how he's spending his money

00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,870
transparency is key also don't forget to

00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,430
say thank you

00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,710
and don't only think your core

00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:16,990
contributors thank everyone who

00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:19,089
contributes there are so many ways you

00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:22,060
can do that you can send people cards

00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:24,250
you can do happiness packages you can do

00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:26,670
shout outs on Twitter you can send them

00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:29,470
special stickers all of us love stickers

00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:31,810
or you can thank people in the release

00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:34,060
notes and we often tend to think code

00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:36,160
contributors in our release notes but we

00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:38,830
don't think people who do marketing or

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,540
take a triage or documentation so be me

00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:42,160
next time you have a big release thank

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,770
those people and your release notes as

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,020
well it's such a small thing to do but

00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:50,920
it has such a great impact on those

00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:54,420
people their work and efforts matter as

00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:57,000
much as those people who contribute code

00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,440
which leads me to the next point

00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,600
documentation is important marketing is

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,810
important small bug fixes are important

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,640
ticket triage is important our

00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:08,440
preparation 'el work is important like I

00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,910
said there are so many components of an

00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,730
open source project that we take for

00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:15,880
granted that really matter let's walk

00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:17,890
through all of them real quick without

00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,990
documentation no one would know how to

00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,680
use your project and you may think that

00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,430
I'm exact

00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:26,080
reading but think about it if there's no

00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:28,120
installation documentation or really any

00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,190
kind of documentation then the only

00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,779
person who knows how to use your project

00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,360
as you or maybe a couple of other

00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:37,330
contributors who have country without a

00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,670
lot of code and I don't know about you

00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:41,380
but if I stumble across a project that I

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:44,080
want to try out but the documentation

00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:46,570
sucks then I will move on to a different

00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,250
project after 30 minutes because I will

00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,020
get frustrated and I just don't want to

00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,420
put the time into it if people don't put

00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:54,550
the time into documentation then why

00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,990
would I put my time into contributing to

00:13:54,550 --> 00:14:02,589
their project or even using their

00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:04,120
project sometimes a picture is worth so

00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:05,860
much more than a thousand words so

00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,360
consider putting pictures and

00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:10,270
screenshots into your documentation

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,980
maybe and breat me maybe even a gif and

00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,450
I don't mean like those funny gifs but

00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,670
gives of you writing code in your

00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:18,279
console can be really helpful especially

00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,870
for people just getting started I'm a

00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:23,890
very visual learner so I always

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:26,800
appreciate any pictures if a project

00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:29,380
isn't well documented then it may as

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,360
well not exist and as an open-source

00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,430
project maintainer you can really steer

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,170
your contributors towards documentation

00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:37,690
you can say hey if you want to submit a

00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:39,670
patch I need documentation to come with

00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:42,610
it if it doesn't then I won't accept

00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:44,500
your patch or you can encourage your

00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:45,850
contributors to write the documentation

00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,610
first and really think about the

00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:50,200
features and how to implement them and

00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,630
then write the code and the next step

00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:56,110
like a documentation driven approach to

00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:58,150
coding next up is marketing without

00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:01,750
marketing no one would know about your

00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:06,420
project how did all of you find out

00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:08,890
about Jango Khan was a Twitter

00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,839
mailing list you just knew about it so

00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:13,810
likely you found out about it because

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:16,300
there's marketing because Rebecca our

00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:19,120
communications chair put a lot of work

00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:21,820
into our Twitter and the same needs to

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,500
happen for an open source project your

00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,200
open source project needs a website

00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,870
that's well designed and easy to

00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,339
navigate but not cluttered your project

00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:32,170
needs an active Twitter account your

00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:34,280
project needs a mailing list that your

00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:36,110
project needs a blog

00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,060
and I don't know if you've ever run a

00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:41,210
social media account but it's a lot of

00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:43,280
work you need to figure out what you put

00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:45,890
into a 140 character limit that's

00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,230
informative but also funny you need to

00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:49,670
use the right hashtags you need to tweet

00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,680
at the right time to reach all the

00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,630
different time zones so it's really not

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,250
an easy job sometimes people think that

00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:57,470
people who work on social media they

00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:01,250
just play all day but it's really hard

00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:03,140
work your project needs people to

00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,850
evangelize if you've ever prepared a

00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:07,340
conference talk you know that it's a lot

00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,990
of work and it's likely that you won't

00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,370
be able to attend all the conference's

00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:12,650
you would like to so you need other

00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:14,630
people help with that you need people to

00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,760
help you with sprint organization and

00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:19,370
promotions friends are so important for

00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,200
open source projects I don't know if

00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,430
you've heard of the be ware project by

00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,370
Russell Keith McGee

00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:27,590
they do a really awesome job at sprints

00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,420
Russell gives away those challenge coins

00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:31,910
which everyone gets that makes their

00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:34,520
first contribution to beware I'm sure

00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:36,200
they'll be doing that again today on

00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,730
Thursday and Friday so you will see

00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,020
people walking around with challenge

00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,750
coins though you'll see them tweet about

00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:43,310
them I can highly encourage you to

00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,080
contribute to be aware or talk to

00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:47,270
Russell or Phillip who's sitting right

00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:50,710
there who contributes to be aware or KT

00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:53,630
McGlothlin and find out more but beware

00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:55,010
next we have ticket triage if there

00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:57,290
weren't people who worked on taker

00:16:55,010 --> 00:17:00,320
ticket triage and bugs wouldn't get

00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:02,570
fixed or it would take significantly

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,730
longer tickets need to be assessed and

00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,920
or in according to urgency and

00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:09,589
difficulty they need to be assigned

00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,240
labels and oftentimes you also need to

00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:13,550
communicate with the people who create

00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,280
the ticket and clarify what exactly they

00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:19,610
mend what other problems

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:22,459
bugs need to reroute reproduced and so

00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:24,589
on also as an open-source project

00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:27,620
maintainer when it comes to take a

00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:29,810
triage you need to say no a lot actually

00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:32,690
you need to say no more than you need to

00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:34,490
say yes when you need to when you see a

00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,290
new issue and you already know that you

00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:38,060
won't be working on it in the next six

00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:40,630
to twelve months then it's sometimes

00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:42,230
better to say hey thank you for this

00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,790
ticket I approve

00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:46,190
Shadid it's an interesting issue but

00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:48,230
it's not a priority for me right now and

00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,240
you may think this is rude but if you

00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,940
have issues sitting in your github

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,679
repository that are years old and people

00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:57,410
will think you that you just don't care

00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:59,570
so sometimes it's better to put upfront

00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,910
why you won't explain you want to close

00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:04,790
this issue and just communicate well

00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:06,950
with people and also do you don't want

00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:08,809
to clutter up your github repository

00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:11,000
which a bunch of issues which you think

00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:12,320
are not necessary so either close them

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,200
or if it's something that you don't have

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,210
time to work on personally but you would

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:21,440
appreciate a patch than ask the person

00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:24,350
to make a pull request bugs are a little

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,450
bit different but again if you know that

00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:28,730
you won't be working on fixing a bug in

00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:30,650
the next six to twelve months then maybe

00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:33,230
close the issue and document it as an

00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:35,600
own limitation rather than keeping it

00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:37,460
open for forever and in general you

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,210
should treat issues and pull requests

00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:42,710
like a conversation with a maintainer

00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:44,960
tom Christie wrote a really good article

00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:46,910
on sustainable source management it's a

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,640
really quick five minute read I can

00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:51,020
highly recommend that you go and read it

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,520
don't worry about writing down the link

00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:56,540
right now I'm gonna be tweeting out the

00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:58,820
link to my slides after my talk as

00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:00,290
you've heard me talking about open

00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,120
source projects you may have noticed

00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:04,669
that I never talked about people doing

00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,530
this alone I always talked about groups

00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:09,440
of people our communal communities of

00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:11,900
people nobody succeeds alone if you

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,030
think about your own coding journey you

00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,360
probably had mentors he probably had

00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:19,429
people who helped you co-workers friends

00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:21,980
you didn't do this all alone most likely

00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:24,530
an open source project they're also team

00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,210
and community efforts you certainly can

00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,160
do this all by yourself but I wouldn't

00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:29,960
recommend it because it's not very

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,530
sustainable and it's likely that you

00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:37,220
will burn out at some point community is

00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:39,950
key like I said I a lot of people about

00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:41,870
Django love the community I'm here for

00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:44,470
the community I haven't touched Jenga

00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:49,520
code and probably a whole year or longer

00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:51,559
and community as work you need people to

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,770
cultivate new contributors you need to

00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:55,320
establish and maintain

00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:57,360
communication channels without a good

00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,070
community your project won't be

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,900
successful so you really need to figure

00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:03,420
out how to nurture your community

00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,070
because most likely your contributions

00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:08,300
will come out of the community and

00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:10,710
people will only contribute if they feel

00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,500
accepted and appreciate it and like

00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:15,270
they're getting something out of this

00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,580
you may have heard Brad cannons famous

00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:20,040
quote I came for the language I stayed

00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:22,860
for the community he said this about the

00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,300
Python community like I said I feel that

00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:27,420
way about the Django community I know

00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:29,250
that a lot of you do as well what it

00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,650
comes down to is always the community

00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,240
and when we talk community we also need

00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,620
to talk about diversity because

00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,660
diversity matters

00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,850
Django Khan and other conferences put a

00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,800
lot of work into diversity we have a

00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:43,710
dedicated diversity each year which is

00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:46,470
me PyCon has a diversity chair other

00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:48,420
conferences do as well your project will

00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,760
never reach its full potential if you

00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:53,460
don't have a diverse set of contributors

00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,830
and with diversity I mean more than just

00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,480
women I mean people of different

00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:59,100
ethnicities people of different age

00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,440
groups people with different sexual

00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,480
orientations people of different

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,100
educational backgrounds and people of

00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,720
different skill levels and expertise

00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:12,000
open-source projects need contributions

00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,670
of all from people of all skill levels

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,680
and expertise you don't only need the

00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:18,570
experienced coders if we keep only

00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,360
nurturing those people who already are

00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:23,130
superstar coders then at one point those

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,740
people will go away but we don't have a

00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:28,020
second generation who can come after

00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,940
them so if you think it's a waste of

00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,470
time to mentor people it's really not

00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,630
because you're nurturing the next

00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:35,490
generation who at one point we'll open

00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:38,160
it we'll maintain your open source

00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:40,320
project I'll give you another example

00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,090
the people who write the docs usually

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,610
other people who use the code the most

00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:46,680
and are most familiar with it this

00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:49,020
oftentimes leads to Doc's being written

00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,730
on a very high level which means that a

00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,590
beginner coder an intermediate coder

00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:54,000
might not be able to understand it or

00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:55,830
someone coming from a different language

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,170
might not be able to understand it and

00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:59,940
if people at this level don't understand

00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:03,240
your documentation then you need to go

00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:05,370
and fix it but if you wrote the

00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,860
documentation yourself then it's likely

00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:08,440
that your

00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,880
aligned to these other people who are

00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,950
having issues with it so you need people

00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,809
of different skill levels and expertise

00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:17,880
to go and reach your documentation and

00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:17,880
tell you how you can improve upon it

00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:23,770
even if you don't write code or aren't

00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:26,170
technical you can still contribute I

00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:28,240
spend a lot of time talking about how

00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:30,400
open source projects consist of so much

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,309
more than code all of us have different

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,799
talents some of us are really good event

00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:37,840
organizers some some of us love social

00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:40,090
media like I said I haven't touched

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,250
Jenga code in a long time but I'm really

00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:44,679
passionate about diversity work so help

00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,780
as the diversity chair I'll give you two

00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:48,340
other examples

00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:50,620
Ashley McNamara is big in the NGO

00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:53,140
community and she she's but she's also

00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:56,200
very talented artist and she created a

00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:58,179
website called gopher Ã«ismÃ­ where you

00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,010
can create a gopher version of yourself

00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:02,230
I would highly I would recommend that

00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:04,210
you try it out it's really cute and she

00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:07,270
also creates these stickers all of us

00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:09,790
love stickers but not a lot of us have a

00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:11,679
talent to design stickers so this is the

00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,210
talent she had what she brought into the

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,309
community which has nothing to do with

00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:17,350
code per se but which was still

00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:19,059
important if you know Adrienne Lowe

00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:20,220
she's not here right now but she's

00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:23,650
flying in tomorrow

00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:27,160
Adrienne Lowe used to be a chef before

00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:29,559
she became a programmer and she tends to

00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,240
bring cookies to conferences because

00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:32,890
everyone loves cookies and Adrienne

00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,809
likes to bake vegan cookies so she

00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:36,400
brings those cookies and they have

00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:40,150
nothing to do with programming but the

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:42,250
community loves them so I'm gonna take a

00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:44,200
little water break for 30 seconds and I

00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,250
would like all of you to write down one

00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,010
talent that you have

00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:50,650
that has nothing to do with coding which

00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:55,660
you could use to bring into our

00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:57,669
community just one some people think

00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:00,010
that you have to submit a code of a

00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:02,440
patch of 5200 lines of code for it to

00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:04,570
matter and that's not wrong my first

00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,240
open source contribution was going

00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:09,450
through the Django Girls tutorial and

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:13,120
correcting grammatical mistakes and

00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:14,500
other little language mistakes you may

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,360
think that didn't matter but it actually

00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,490
did because it made the tutorial easier

00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,690
to read for others so you don't have to

00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,159
contribute whole pack

00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:23,129
just of code in order to make a

00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:26,019
difference in order to be able to

00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:27,730
contribute to open source as an open

00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:29,590
source project maintainer you need to be

00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:31,210
aware of this put in your readme that

00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:33,129
you're open to new contributors that

00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:37,389
you're open to first-time contributors

00:24:33,129 --> 00:24:38,980
create first-timers only labels and

00:24:37,389 --> 00:24:42,429
label your issues according to

00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:43,990
difficulties so people can pick last

00:24:42,429 --> 00:24:47,529
difficult ones if you if they're

00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:49,299
contributing for the first time also put

00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:51,960
in your contact information so people

00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:54,610
can reach out to you offer a mentorship

00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,649
for django con we have a speaker mentor

00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:58,809
program and you may have noticed that we

00:24:56,649 --> 00:25:01,240
have only that we already have that we

00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:03,580
almost have 50% women's speakers which

00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,379
is really awesome and i attribute a lot

00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:10,929
of that success to our mentorship

00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:12,460
program mentorship really matters as an

00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:14,289
open-source maintainer ask your

00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,179
contributors if they want to be mentors

00:25:14,289 --> 00:25:18,460
your mentors need to need to be diverse

00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:20,230
because some women only want to be

00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:24,029
mentored by other women so you need to

00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:27,789
have a div a set of mentors that also

00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:29,889
matches your set of contributors pay it

00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:32,019
forward give more than you received its

00:25:29,889 --> 00:25:33,789
most likely that all of you received

00:25:32,019 --> 00:25:36,009
some help or mentorship so pay it

00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:37,809
forward and help other people I gave a

00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:40,629
whole talk on mentorship and there's a

00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:43,840
video which you can find here and also a

00:25:40,629 --> 00:25:45,610
transcript which you can find if you

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,799
have any questions about mentorship or

00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:53,019
open source I'll be around and I would

00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:54,730
love to chat about it as an open source

00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:57,429
project maintainer if you're looking for

00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:59,470
new contributors look among your users

00:25:57,429 --> 00:26:02,649
because it's likely that those people

00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:05,590
who use your project or want to give

00:26:02,649 --> 00:26:07,210
back and learn more about it but also if

00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:08,440
you're looking to make your first open

00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:09,789
source contribution there were a couple

00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,919
of people here haven't made an

00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:14,649
open-source contribution yet look at the

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,269
projects that you already use don't look

00:26:14,649 --> 00:26:17,980
super far just look at something that

00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:19,840
you use that you like and see how you

00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:22,090
can get involved like I said my first

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,860
contribution I made to the Django girls

00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:26,169
tutorial because I was heavily involved

00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:30,009
as a django girl's organizer so it made

00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:32,660
sense last but not least your project

00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:34,370
needs a code of conduct

00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,690
you may think your project doesn't need

00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:37,910
a code of conduct because all of your

00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:40,340
contributors are super nice and they may

00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:43,310
be but your project still needs a cut of

00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:45,110
conduct be prepared make sure that your

00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:47,480
project is a safe place for everyone to

00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:49,670
contribute and you may actually lose a

00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,350
couple of contributors or potential

00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:54,470
contributors if your project does not

00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:56,180
have a code of conduct because keep some

00:26:54,470 --> 00:27:00,110
people won't contribute if there's no

00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:03,530
COC but a code of conduct only matters

00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:05,390
only it also needs to be enforced if you

00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:07,670
have a COC but you don't do anything

00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:10,130
about it when people complain then it's

00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:11,780
really kind of useless you need to be

00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:14,270
willing to call people out for bad

00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:16,520
behavior don't let the trolls win

00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:18,500
Sasha Romain gave a really good talk

00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:21,110
about cuttle conduct just before lunch

00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,580
if you didn't catch their talk I can

00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:24,980
highly recommend that you go and watch

00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:27,170
it I know they're also happy to chat

00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:29,180
with you about code of conduct so am i

00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:35,960
and so are other people the Jango COC

00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:38,090
community that are here if your project

00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,130
does not have a code of conduct please

00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:41,740
do me a favor and implement one today

00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:44,780
you don't need to write your own

00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:46,640
coralline ADA mg did so for you and it's

00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:48,770
called the contributor covenant and it's

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,290
online and it's free and it's available

00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:53,240
for you to use it's been implemented

00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:55,070
into thousands of open-source project

00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,040
and it's been translated into many

00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:59,960
different languages and if you do

00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:03,440
