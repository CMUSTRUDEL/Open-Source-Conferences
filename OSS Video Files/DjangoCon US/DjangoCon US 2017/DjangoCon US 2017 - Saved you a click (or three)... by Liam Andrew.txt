	DjangoCon US 2017 - Saved you a click (or three): Supercharging the Django admin with actions and views by Liam Andrew

The goal of this talk is to “save you a click”: while this is a pejorative phrase in The Texas Tribune’s newsroom, we love saving our reporters and editors clicks in the Django admin when they’re filing a breaking story. We’ve combined several helpful Django features, libraries, patterns and customizations – ranging from the obvious to the advanced – to supercharge our admin, allowing for live previews, shortcuts, and dynamic updates. Taken together, these tools suggest a framework for developing new admin features quickly and maintainably.

This talk would be especially valuable to Django developers who know the basics of customizing the admin, but aren’t sure where to take it next, or want to add some bells and whistles. It also opens up to larger questions about customizing the admin that would benefit more advanced Django developers. I would definitely allow time for questions and discussion to hear from others who might have tricks up their sleeves.

This talk was presented at: https://2017.djangocon.us/talks/saved-you-a-click-or-three-supercharging-the-django-admin-with-actions-and-views/

[Music]

00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,770
for coming I'm gonna be talking about

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:22,080
actions and views in the Django admin

00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:23,340
mostly this is a lot of this is that

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,470
talking about some easy ways to

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,599
customize it to get people some quick

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,790
information - yeah the joke is to save

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,120
you a click this is saving our admin

00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,800
users a click so especially we're gonna

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,239
start talking talking with a lot of tips

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,340
and tricks and libraries it might be an

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,739
overload at first it's going to go from

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,840
more beginner level and then we're gonna

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:45,629
kind of abstract it out and talk a

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,399
little more abstract at the end but the

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,230
point is that there's a lot of ways to

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,820
do this to do some of the things that we

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,289
need to do with the admin are there a

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,850
lot of libraries that kind of overlap

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,070
and conflict that are all kind of on the

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,600
same page so the conclusion isn't

00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,820
necessarily as part of it is to give you

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,920
guys some tools and ideas and tricks but

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,629
part of it is also to to sort of suggest

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,190
other ways to think about the admin more

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:09,300
holistically and provide a framework for

00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,380
it and also I thought this talk was 45

00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,550
minutes so that's another reason it's

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,190
going to be overlooked because I'm gonna

00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:16,350
be going a little faster than I expected

00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,820
a lot of this is uh I've learned a lot

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,990
of this by doing work at The Texas

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,850
Tribune I've been there for about two

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,440
years the Texas Tribune is based in

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:26,550
Austin we're a non-profit non partisan

00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:28,980
all digital news organization we we

00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,870
focus on Texas politics and policy we

00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,090
have a combination of news data and

00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,830
events we also have five to two of my

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,150
colleagues and the entire also here who

00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,860
focus on these things as well we'd love

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,190
to talk to you more but the idea is

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:43,620
basically we have a lot of users our CMS

00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:45,180
users are very busy strapped for time

00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,400
they need to publish breaking news very

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,870
fast but then we also do a lot of

00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,220
investigative features and longer

00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,200
stories where we want well structured

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,910
data where we can make sure that it gets

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,070
presented well all the time and on every

00:01:53,910 --> 00:02:00,240
platform that we're on so it's a tough

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:01,740
balance and we we do it all with Django

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,020
it's all pretty much vanilla Django

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,200
right now we're moving looking at moving

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,489
towards a CMS framework like Django CMS

00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,739
but at the moment yeah it's all pretty

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,530
much vanilla so we've have found a lot

00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,970
of little tips and hacks and things that

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,890
you can do in the in that vanilla Django

00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:22,439
admin to make it really fast and easy

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:23,819
for users to publish stories a little

00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:26,300
bit about my background I've been at the

00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:28,010
Tribune for two years before that I

00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,720
in a program called comparative Media

00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,760
Studies at MIT working in the hyper

00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,490
Studios digital humanities lab and

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,070
before that I was working at a startup

00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:38,870
news curation startup called wiser I was

00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,730
battling the Django admin there as well

00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,320
but I feel like it really stretched its

00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,290
limits in the last couple of years at

00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,120
the Tribune

00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:49,550
we found that especially when I first

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,220
started with Django when I was working

00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:54,200
with it I really quickly wanted to add a

00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,510
couple of easy buttons here and there

00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,790
quick actions quick to use just a little

00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:01,760
stuff that shouldn't be that hard and

00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:03,830
every time and I had a sad time as and

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,570
it ended up with a lot of coupled files

00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,520
a lot of couple of code it just never

00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:09,980
felt right to me I struggled with it a

00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,680
lot but at the Tribune we recently

00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:15,110
completed an admin redesign a little bit

00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,670
on just you know rescanning of our admin

00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,860
and we I learned a lot it gave us an

00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,880
opportunity to read our connect some of

00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:24,500
the ways that we're doing some of the

00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:26,270
admin customizations so if you think of

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,710
the admin the Django admin is a series

00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,180
of Windows that are increasingly getting

00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:32,150
into a kernel of information you need

00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,620
you start with the whole dashboard site

00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,630
you know the whole site then you move

00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,040
into a list view and then you move into

00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,690
a detail view and then you move into in

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,060
lines inside of that I'm gonna kind of

00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:42,650
use that that's zooming in as a

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:46,850
framework for some of the tricks I'm

00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:47,959
going to talk about in this talk then at

00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:51,230
the end I'm going to try to wrap it all

00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:53,690
up into a bow and talk about why why

00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,760
they all have the similar patterns that

00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:57,440
we can learn from so yeah again then

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,440
part of the intention is not intention

00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,520
but it might overwhelm and it will be a

00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,780
lot but hopefully you'll make some sense

00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,050
at the end I'm throwing a lot against

00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:08,450
the wall I want to see what sticks we're

00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:11,000
gonna be using an example site it's

00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:14,959
called new town it's a blog by dogs for

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,630
dogs and about dogs and it also has a

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,890
database of breeds dog breeds which were

00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:22,730
scraped from the American Kennel Club

00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:25,070
the other day so if you can follow along

00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,870
at github github.com slash mail backward

00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,040
slash News hounds theirs are going to be

00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,450
examples there of everything I'm about

00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,030
to show so hopefully it won't be quite

00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:33,380
as overwhelming and I apologize in

00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,090
advance their extremely contrived

00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,840
examples I ran out of ideas for how to

00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,840
talk about dogs

00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:44,560
the data model that we have in new

00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,950
talent is basically that we have we have

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,230
blog posts and these have they a post

00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,630
might be about might be about individual

00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,920
dogs that you're talking about each of

00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,870
these dogs can be part of multiple

00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,520
breeds in us that's a custom through

00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,290
model because the dog can be 25

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,530
percentage now is there in 75 percent

00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,120
Chihuahua and then and then each breed

00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,010
is part of a group breed group so for

00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,300
instance a toy the toy group or the

00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:10,840
herding dog group or the terrier group

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:14,260
again this is really contrived but got

00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,580
to start somewhere so really quickly

00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,870
going to start with the admin site and

00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,060
landing page a quick thing that you can

00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:22,540
do here to make your your initial

00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:25,600
dashboard a little friendlier is that to

00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:29,200
have a custom admin site on your on your

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,300
Django admin basically this this lets

00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,190
you it has a couple advantages first of

00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,140
all you can customize your site header

00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:37,690
so now you'll see over here if I can get

00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:39,040
my yeah we're here see it says news hand

00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,940
up here at the top rather than just a

00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:45,190
Django administration and then it also

00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,900
allows you to do custom login templates

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,370
so here I made a custom login and i just

00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,450
added a forgot your password option down

00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,790
here which is something that we have on

00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,710
our on our CMS so it's really handy to

00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:57,310
have this custom admin site to make

00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:58,900
really easy quick changes and it I also

00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,610
personally like that it puts all of the

00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,140
admin site logic into one module so you

00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,120
don't have these auto discovers going on

00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,800
all over and across different apps you

00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:10,600
have a centralized place where all of

00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:12,070
your admin site logic lives moving into

00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,450
the change list views this is probably

00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,790
the bulk of it that we have a lot of a

00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:18,280
lot of tricks up our sleeve here here's

00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:21,580
the basic change list view with just the

00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:24,400
the blog post you'll see there's one

00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:28,330
article that's been published and it has

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,530
a great headline the doesn't give us

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,150
very much information though there's a

00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:34,270
there aren't a lot of columns here it's

00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:36,100
not not much you can do so the first

00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:39,310
thing you can do is add list display to

00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,870
your to your change list this lets you

00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,190
add any other columns you want so here

00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,480
you get a second column pretty

00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:46,060
straightforward most people know this

00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,650
one but if you take it let's display a

00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,150
step further you can do a few other

00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:52,280
things so first of all you can add

00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,690
extra fields that aren't actually on

00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,060
your model and then to find them in the

00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:58,160
admin and tell them is this you know

00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,160
they say what you want the content of

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,139
the the column to be so in this case

00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,699
we're just listing all the dogs that are

00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:09,680
that have been sort of tagged or

00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:11,660
associated with this blog post if you do

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,490
this don't forget to select related or

00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,620
prefetch your related model because

00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:21,620
otherwise it will get heavy and slow

00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:23,210
very fast the the other thing I'll talk

00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,220
about with lists display one thing we

00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,100
use a lot is to combine it with format

00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:31,400
and Ringo's format HTML this lets us put

00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:34,910
any arbitrary HTML into those columns so

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,979
you don't you you can kind of in this

00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:40,340
case for instance what we're doing is

00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:42,260
we're for each dog we're putting it and

00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:46,610
we're making a little link hyperlink to

00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:48,350
the dog's absolute URL and manifests

00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,389
over here it's hard to see kind of hard

00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:52,220
to see but you can you just give this

00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:54,050
list nicely formatted list of names and

00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,789
you have a link out to go see those

00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,530
names the other thing I'll point out

00:07:55,789 --> 00:08:01,010
here is this is just an HTML entity for

00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:02,660
an arrow I I think that's a really easy

00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,490
way to do visual communication rather

00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,380
than overloading somebody with walls of

00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,970
text or a bunch of hyperlinks just put a

00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,880
little symbols in there it's just text

00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:15,620
it's really easy to do and and it makes

00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:16,610
makes it visually cleaner I'm cheating a

00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,620
little here I'm going to talk about the

00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,789
detail of you really quickly and then go

00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,260
back to the changeless for you but

00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:24,560
another way that you can use format HTML

00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:26,780
is with read-only fields and read-only

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,380
fields very similarly I if you set

00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,610
sprite in this case it's a photo preview

00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,140
this then you put if you put it in your

00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,150
fields it'll show up in the detail view

00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,380
and you can again put any HTML you want

00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:39,469
in here so in this case you're getting a

00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:42,709
preview of this dog that's dog breed I

00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:44,660
can't read it but it's a cute dog it

00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:46,810
gets into your admin who wouldn't like

00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,810
that

00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:52,550
back to the list view another handy

00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:54,920
trick is list editable this one here

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,480
you'll see it turns this headline field

00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,730
into an open text field that you can

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,510
just edit from the list view so if you

00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,830
had 100 of them here you can edit all

00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:04,650
at once and then go click the Save

00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:07,710
button at the bottom and and you're all

00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:09,270
set we find that this one since it adds

00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:12,570
another button and it adds a whole bunch

00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:14,070
of form fields it's not very friendly to

00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,620
users and he stresses people out when

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:18,270
they see it but we actually we use it

00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,220
it's particularly handy for cleanup

00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:22,470
Sprint's what we found so for instance

00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:25,140
at the Texas Tribune we have a lot of

00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:27,150
tag data and some of its very messy so

00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,200
one time there was there was one sprint

00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,390
where we decide we're gonna clean up our

00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,730
tags and so for those I made a lot of

00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:35,010
fields list editable for the time that

00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,810
we were doing this sprint and that was

00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,340
really helpful for making you know just

00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,110
getting in there really quickly making

00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:45,600
the big alterations and then and then

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:50,190
saving then you're done I'm moving on

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:52,170
from displays to actions actions at

00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,940
their most basic level admin actions

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:56,370
allow you to basically check off certain

00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,560
items in that change list and the check

00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:01,110
boxes and then perform a function based

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,810
on on what you've checked off in this

00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:05,720
case this code is publishing all of the

00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:11,640
checked off items that you had it might

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:13,650
set them all to be published one thing

00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,390
we started to do at the Tribune is make

00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,310
dynamic actions based on some of the

00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:19,260
choices that are in our models so in

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:20,760
this case we have a few different states

00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,530
for publication you might have it in

00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,500
draft mode and edit mode and publish

00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:28,050
mode and here this code is basically

00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,630
just making an action for each of those

00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:33,150
states and then it manifests in the end

00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,740
with this list at the bottom of actions

00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,600
you know you can set it to draft set it

00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,570
to a published I set it to edit and it

00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,920
will just change based on the models

00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:44,600
zooming out even farther this is really

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:47,640
tiny code I'm sorry but even farther

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,210
we've started working on admin admin

00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,480
mix-ins

00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:53,790
or action mix-ins in this case what it's

00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,950
doing is basically defining what you can

00:10:53,790 --> 00:11:00,030
do is define an action fields attribute

00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:02,910
on your admin model and at that point it

00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:04,860
will add those action choices for you so

00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:07,740
in this case it works for either a

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:10,350
boolean field or for choices so here for

00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,760
instance we have a post admin which is

00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,710
setting it to either draft editor

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,380
published and then down here it's hard

00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,940
read but you also have a dog admin dogs

00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:21,450
have an attribute attribute for whether

00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:23,580
they're good or not and in this case you

00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:25,860
can set the attribute to be you can set

00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,910
all of this checked items to be all of

00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,980
them could be good all of them could be

00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,900
bad and it's just done with this nice

00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:36,240
handy mixin so you don't have to worry

00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:39,110
about replicability moving a little bit

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,870
more into the libraries and packages

00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:44,790
that we might talk about what if you

00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,350
want to add actions for instance for

00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,210
each item in your change list you have

00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:50,040
your you have your list of items and you

00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:52,260
just want yeah button next at the end of

00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,700
each of them to do something with that

00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:58,530
individual item this is a really handy

00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,960
package called Django Ivan row actions

00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:02,220
and it basically adds that column for

00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,290
you down here in the corner you'll see

00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,700
it has it has drop-down called actions

00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:08,430
you click on it

00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:11,040
you in this case you can either redirect

00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:15,900
to the delete view for that individual

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,970
object or you can make make all the dogs

00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,830
good I guess and this one especially

00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,290
defining a particular action or a

00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:25,400
particular URL and then it will it will

00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,400
do the rest for you

00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,870
another package that we use a lot is

00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,760
called django object actions this was

00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:36,660
developed actually at the texas tribune

00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:38,820
by our old colleague chris chang it does

00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,940
a whole lot for us this is one thing it

00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,770
does basically it lets you put easily

00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,480
put change buttons in the change list

00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,440
without modifying your template so

00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,940
you'll see down here you have this

00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,350
publish all edits button it just shows

00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,300
up here in the corner on this change

00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:54,510
list view and it's really just like

00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:56,910
defining any other function here and the

00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:59,430
one key part is this changeless actions

00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:01,170
part that let and that that's really

00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:03,210
what's that's all that's all it takes to

00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:04,770
add a button right there which job we

00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:08,760
actually found was it was harder than it

00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:11,250
should have been to do sustainably one

00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:14,040
way that we use these buttons for our

00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:16,050
models is we often our sync our models

00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,490
with external API so for instance we

00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,560
sync with MailChimp or Eventbrite and

00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:22,140
that that's where we host or a lot of

00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,670
our data for our events so we might put

00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,480
a sync button right there so that people

00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,790
can quickly just sync up our CMS

00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,070
our art website with whatever's going on

00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:34,449
externally and it's it's a pretty easy

00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:37,690
place to put it moving assuming further

00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:39,190
into the change views again with Django

00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,899
object actions they have not just

00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:44,199
changed list actions they also have

00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:47,019
changed actions and these are even

00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:49,000
handier I think so in this case you know

00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:52,870
this just lets you take that particular

00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,410
instance and use that rather than having

00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:57,760
it be list wide here we are making all

00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,260
the dogs good in this particular article

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,820
so this vertical might have mentioned a

00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:03,940
few dogs they're all automatically good

00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:05,079
if you click this button and also it

00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,820
maintains a lot of the admin features

00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:08,560
like message user you can you know you

00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:11,100
just do a lot of the same functionality

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:15,430
that you could do with any any view any

00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:17,500
admin feature and I want to reiterate it

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:19,420
redirects make it really easy to add

00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,070
hyperlinks or the equivalent of

00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,470
hyperlinks without adding a changing

00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:25,060
your template model so in this case this

00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,410
is basically a link it's just your

00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,550
you're going to a certain change

00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,190
ListView

00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:32,709
but you're doing it with actions and

00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:34,149
that just is a little bit more it moves

00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:35,680
it further into the back end and lets

00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:37,120
you sort of control it more I also

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,470
really like this handy takes instance

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,110
our query set decorator that comes from

00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:42,670
Django object actions which lets you put

00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:45,010
it on both the change and the change

00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:47,170
list view at once so that's a that's a

00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:53,199
handy feature and a shout-out to Chris

00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:56,500
up here here because actions are just

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:58,540
views under the hood you can add

00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,430
confirmed views confirmation view is

00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,230
kind of like the Django delete view for

00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:04,480
resources this is kind of a combination

00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:07,750
of the two things and the two sort of

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,910
the action and the the reader or the the

00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:14,190
link so in this case stepping through

00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:18,430
what this publish edited action is doing

00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:21,190
you start with so it the first thing you

00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:23,069
do is it looks for a post request it

00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:25,089
doesn't see one so it just renders a

00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:27,279
confirmation view and here's the

00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:29,199
contract the confirmation view over here

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,569
it just makes sure that you that you

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:34,240
want to delete these things the second

00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:36,339
time around if you put all you have to

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,519
do and it's really tiny text but all you

00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:40,310
have to do is put

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,959
an action value into the post data and

00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:44,480
it will send it straight back to this

00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:47,750
view so you can use the same view to

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,490
both render the confirmation of you and

00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,709
also process the confirmation when it

00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,240
happens and this way you can you know

00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:54,379
you get the best of both worlds and it's

00:15:53,240 --> 00:16:00,529
all wrapped into one nice little

00:15:54,379 --> 00:16:02,629
function going booming further into in

00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:05,839
lines we have a couple other packages

00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:09,800
that we have found really handy here

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:11,569
this is sort of the first one here is

00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,360
just a generic inline this has no edits

00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:19,790
this is showing a post can have multiple

00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:22,220
dogs and you can assign them django

00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:24,529
inline actions is basically so we

00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:27,019
earlier we saw Django admin row actions

00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:28,550
which lets you change specific items

00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:31,310
from the change list this is sort of

00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:34,660
another layer of inception from that

00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:37,129
where you're now be able to edit and

00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:40,310
edit and process things from the inline

00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:43,160
view since Django admin row actions

00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:47,089
couldn't do that so in this case you are

00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:51,290
again just getting a link to all of you

00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:56,660
redirects to a different resource it's

00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:58,970
pretty easy to do just just for

00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:01,100
reference you can also use Django inline

00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:02,660
actions in the change list so this is

00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,669
kind of redundant with Django admin row

00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:07,480
actions which I saw showed earlier but

00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:07,480
it's good to know

00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:14,000
another admin feature that looks really

00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,530
handy we haven't had an opportunity to

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,539
use it at the Tribune but I've always

00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:20,209
been interested in is Django nested

00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:22,010
admin this is developed by our friends

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:27,709
at the Atlantic and it's basically

00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:30,140
inline inception in this case you have a

00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:34,070
breed group so that might be like the

00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:36,020
toy dogs and then in each breed or each

00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:38,000
breed group has multiple breeds and then

00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:41,000
each breed has multiple dogs associated

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,309
with that breed this Django nested admin

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,399
allows you to put all three of those

00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:49,070
layers right in one view so here you're

00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:50,570
able to edit everything about the breed

00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,750
group everything about the breed or

00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:54,960
anything about the

00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:56,160
themselves but what it also does sorting

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,660
for you that's a really handy feature if

00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,880
you have orderable fields you can set it

00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:03,360
as orderable and then just drag and drop

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:05,160
them one warning is that would be aware

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,020
of over querying without prefetching and

00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,090
I'm not entirely sure how that works

00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:13,260
under the hood for for Django nested

00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:15,810
admin but just to be aware of doing too

00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:20,070
much with because your view could get

00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:22,560
really really slow so I'm done with

00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:24,150
talking about packages for now I want to

00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,260
look a little bit at what we could do

00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,910
next

00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,380
sort of thinking about all of these

00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:31,530
together all these different packages

00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:34,110
and ideas one thing that I found is that

00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:37,050
basically all of them are using this get

00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:39,120
urls function from the admin get URLs

00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:42,450
basically from the Django Docs it just

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,250
shows you can add any views any

00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:48,480
additional views to that model admin

00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:50,520
on-the-fly and it's a really handy idea

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,080
and pretty it's pretty much what how all

00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:58,740
of these different tools and mix-ins are

00:18:52,080 --> 00:19:02,730
using are working so we've started to

00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:05,670
fold more of our admin features into

00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:07,800
mix-ins using get urls and specifically

00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:10,410
we are interested in how to do this with

00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,030
ajax views we want to we want to put a

00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:14,480
little bit more dynamic information and

00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:16,890
live updating information into our admin

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,270
but we and we want to be able to do it

00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,640
so it where it integrates nicely with

00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:23,460
the Django admin in this case I believe

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,230
this example we are putting in a preview

00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,600
of all the dogs that are currently

00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:29,040
trending I'm not sure what's what

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,040
they're trending why they're trending

00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,660
but but but you might you know if you're

00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,890
a writer writing about dogs you might

00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,950
want to know which dogs are trending so

00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:40,620
you know who to write about so in this

00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:43,530
case it basically this get urls function

00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:45,510
is just sending anything that goes to

00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:47,640
the trending URL back to that trending

00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:50,010
function and that's where a lot of the

00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,470
work happens here I happen to be using

00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:55,170
the dog serializer from Django rest

00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:57,240
framework to actually create the dog

00:19:55,170 --> 00:20:01,410
response you could do it in a million

00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:03,990
different ways and then the the

00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:05,580
JavaScript is it looks it looks a little

00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:07,950
long but it's really not very calm

00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:11,370
located it's just calling an API and

00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:13,530
updating a container - this is sort of

00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:14,850
what it ends up looking like and so down

00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:17,100
here you'll see this is this is just the

00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:19,020
change list view over here but above it

00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:21,690
you get this

00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:24,180
Ajax driven little module that shows you

00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:25,320
three dogs that might be trending if you

00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,850
click this button over here that says

00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,710
refresh suggestions you get three

00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:34,290
different dogs or maybe the same dogs if

00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:36,960
they're still trendy so this has gotten

00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:40,110
me thinking like we're using this Ajax

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,660
view it's basically is this JSON view

00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:44,160
and when Python and Django has this

00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,350
incredible framework for doing just that

00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,490
Django rest framework and I've been

00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:51,930
thinking about the best ways that we

00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:54,000
could be combining the all the powers of

00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:55,530
the Django amount of the Django model

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,170
admins with all the powers of Django

00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:59,730
rest framework so here I have the

00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:01,320
trending I'd sort of change this to the

00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:03,870
trending dog view instead of putting

00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:07,320
putting that view on the admin and then

00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:10,080
here I made a new API view that is

00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,790
basically getting it's taking what was

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,230
about a 10 line function and turning

00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,210
into three lines and then also getting

00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:18,090
all the bells and whistles that the rest

00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:19,470
framework gives you on top of that so

00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:22,260
that that's a that's a pretty handy

00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:24,450
pattern that we're interested in one

00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:28,200
step even farther that I've been

00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,880
thinking about we leave this one is

00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,560
basically moving the trending algorithm

00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:35,190
into a model manager that under under

00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:37,320
the dog dog model and then turning us

00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:39,330
into a view set a phone view set I think

00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,890
with so with the right pagination this

00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:44,550
functions exactly the same way as that

00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:45,810
ten line that 10 line view did except

00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:47,430
it's all declarative now there's no

00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:49,410
function really and that feels like a

00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:52,770
better separation of concerns to put the

00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:54,210
trending into the manager as well so

00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,250
this is I feel like this is a really

00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:57,870
promising start to something but it has

00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,970
no way for instance to get into the

00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:01,980
detail view to receive the context that

00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:07,050
the model admin gets at least the way

00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:09,330
that I set it up oh and this is just to

00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:11,430
sort of finish that off this is the this

00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:12,930
would be the get URLs for this this view

00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:16,710
set all you need to do is just add that

00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:17,500
trending URL and call it the call that

00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:22,300
view

00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:24,010
and then you're rolling so yeah I think

00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,470
there's something here and all these

00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:29,260
libraries are kind of pointing to it

00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:31,420
that there's the combining model the

00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,770
Jenga model admin in rest framework is

00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,510
something we're increasingly doing and

00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:37,420
we're curious I feel like it's a very

00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:41,140
powerful combination and want to do more

00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:42,760
with it the you know is there a

00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:46,780
possibility for instance giving full

00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:48,700
crud capability on Django models with

00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,200
Ajax views right in the admin with all

00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:54,340
the contexts and all the richness that

00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:56,140
the montt the Django admin provides I

00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:58,360
think some open questions with that that

00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,500
we aren't sure about you know how do you

00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,630
know what's the best way to integrate

00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:04,150
with the router the router framework

00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:07,450
what what are the best ways to integrate

00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:10,120
to put the admin context into the API

00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:11,710
view sets and what's the best way to

00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,200
manage your front-end assets especially

00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:17,290
your JavaScript your your CSS for

00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,300
whatever you're doing with the Ajax but

00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:21,220
more broadly we want we you know we want

00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,200
our this feels this feels like the right

00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:25,000
step to go we want our admin to be an

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,060
API client just like our website is just

00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,950
like our external services are if it

00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:31,270
feels better architectural II so we're

00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,740
interested in how to work towards it but

00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:35,320
we also don't necessarily want to build

00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,970
a custom hold Django admin and you know

00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,770
separate admin from scratch because we

00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:40,770
just don't have the team for that I

00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,950
think some of this is starting to beg

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,490
the question of like why would we stick

00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:50,740
with the admin at all and I kind of

00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:52,330
pointed to that a little bit I but and I

00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,820
think one of the short answers is we

00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:56,470
have an eight year old website and it's

00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:00,430
a lot of built up code and it would be

00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:02,500
really hard to do that to started to

00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:04,750
basically offload the whole thing onto a

00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,490
whole new system but the longer answer

00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:08,380
is that we're there's a lot of promise

00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:10,180
in the Django admin you know you get

00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,590
these things like versioning for free

00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,230
using Django reversion and you get

00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:15,760
things like locking with Django locking

00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:18,070
and the standardization and in the

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,900
community around that just just opens us

00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:22,150
up to a lot of really interesting

00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,740
possibilities especially with the

00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:26,830
directions that Django rest framework

00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:28,600
has been going so we're excited that

00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,700
we're sticking with the Django admin we

00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,380
might end up

00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,690
as I said we might end up standardizing

00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:36,929
it further by putting it on something

00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:39,029
like Django CMS or wagtail but that's

00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:40,950
the we're just excited about the future

00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:42,630
possibilities on the Django admin and we

00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:45,440
think that there's there's more that

00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:45,440
could be done with it

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,950
so I wanted to shout out to all the

00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:54,000
repositories that I earn the packages

00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:57,870
that we used

00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:01,740
here's links to them on github and I

00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:08,789
think I think I covered them all and to

00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:11,460
reiterate this is news hound and quickly

00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:16,380
I'm gonna show demo just in case some of

00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:18,840
that it was hard to see here's the

00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:21,570
dashboard for news hound you've got

00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:23,190
breeds dogs posts and breed groups if

00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:24,630
you go into the post admin you'll

00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:27,090
suddenly get those trending dogs I'm

00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:29,370
gonna refresh oh we've got a chub chub

00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:33,389
is a oh it's a very interesting

00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:38,490
combination of breeds here these dogs

00:25:33,389 --> 00:25:39,960
are not real skill so i refresh it let's

00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:43,380
let's refresh it again let's just keep

00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,399
looking at dogs for a while and then but

00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,480
so down here I'll show you a couple

00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:47,309
other features that we have in here

00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,330
again we have that view breeds button so

00:25:47,309 --> 00:25:50,340
you can just go quickly see all the

00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:51,480
breed you can publish all your stories

00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,919
that are currently edited mode so right

00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,139
now that's an edit so if I publish this

00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:57,809
I'm gonna get that confirmed view and I

00:25:55,139 --> 00:25:59,159
click and hey it's published and and now

00:25:57,809 --> 00:26:01,919
you see the publication status move to

00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:06,750
published here's this editable field

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:10,820
here so if I want to make it dogs then I

00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:13,799
hit save and it'll update that if I

00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:20,429
click in here you again get the same

00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:21,929
preview and here you'll see evidence the

00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:23,789
inline action so you can see all the

00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:26,880
breed groups that here this dog here as

00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:28,350
part of Kara is a hound I believe this

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,700
is where we'll see the inline action so

00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:31,669
this is going to air the nested admin

00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:34,710
this is going to load really slowly

00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:35,940
because I did not prefetch anything but

00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:37,889
this is basically where you can edit

00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:41,610
pretty much the whole admin from one

00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:45,790
page so that's why it takes a while

00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:48,070
so all of this oh here we go so here you

00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:49,510
have the hound here's the first one you

00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:51,550
know the Afghan hound we've got Harley

00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:53,830
Harley's in Afghan here is a hundred

00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:55,270
percent Afghan hound so you can start to

00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:57,490
change any of those any of these details

00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:59,200
straight here from the admin and you

00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:01,690
know this it's all nested so the next

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,320
one down for instance to see American

00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:09,280
English hound keep going this is a

00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:13,590
really handy feature so all of these

00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:17,080
combines our page this is all about I

00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:18,220
think probably about 100 maybe 200 lines

00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,780
of code and we've really got a lot of

00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:22,270
features in and feels like a nice

00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:24,010
separation of concerns I'm gonna stop

00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:26,530
there because I want time for questions

00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:28,750
and and feedback we're again not really

00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,920
all the way there we have a lot of open

00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:32,170
questions especially around how to

00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:40,470
integrate various brain work so

00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:40,470
