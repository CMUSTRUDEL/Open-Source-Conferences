	DjangoCon US 2017 - Python & Spreadsheets: 2017 Edition by Kojo Idrissa

Spreadsheets are OFTEN terrible. Theyâ€™re also everywhere! As one of the default forms of data exchange, learning to work with spreadsheets directly via Python can save time and effort. Weâ€™ll look at Openpyxl, a library that lets you do just that. Weâ€™ll look at at least two different (beginner-friendly) example cases: transforming one spreadsheet into another spreadsheet and converting a spreadsheet into JSON. Iâ€™ll also use my experience as a former accountant to highlight some of the issues around reading from and writing to a spreadsheet file and how you might deal with them. You MAY even learn to make new friends and grow the Python community! True Story!
