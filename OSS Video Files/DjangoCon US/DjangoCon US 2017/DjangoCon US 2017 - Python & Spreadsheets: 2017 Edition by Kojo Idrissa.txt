	DjangoCon US 2017 - Python & Spreadsheets: 2017 Edition by Kojo Idrissa

Spreadsheets are OFTEN terrible. They’re also everywhere! As one of the default forms of data exchange, learning to work with spreadsheets directly via Python can save time and effort. We’ll look at Openpyxl, a library that lets you do just that. We’ll look at at least two different (beginner-friendly) example cases: transforming one spreadsheet into another spreadsheet and converting a spreadsheet into JSON. I’ll also use my experience as a former accountant to highlight some of the issues around reading from and writing to a spreadsheet file and how you might deal with them. You MAY even learn to make new friends and grow the Python community! True Story!

[Music]

00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:22,650
so I am here I am your presenter

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,689
Kojiro Teresa here are my slides as you

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:28,230
can see I'm very fancy and I've made

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:33,420
very fancy elaborate slides with white

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:34,800
and black text because the man who talks

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,300
about spreadsheets of course I'm very

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,500
concerned about fancy things so the

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,770
talking here Python in spreadsheets

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,359
state-of-the-union August 2017 it's

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,710
called that for a reason and just for

00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,660
informational purposes my name is there

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,940
my twitter handle is also on every slide

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,019
so if you have question you want to

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,269
tweet at me later

00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:56,519
then that's a thing you can do I'm

00:00:54,269 --> 00:00:58,170
usually pretty available so this is

00:00:56,519 --> 00:01:00,620
called state-of-the-union August 27

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,780
because I gave this talk initially in

00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:05,339
2013 or version of it in 2013 when I

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,409
first started using the library I'll be

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,850
talking about so right now I'm a QA

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,150
specialist for start-up in Houston

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,970
called decision health I used to be an

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,300
accountant and then I got an MBA then I

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,190
ran away to China and was a college

00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,620
instructor there for a few years and I

00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,390
felt taught here in the US but all the

00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,920
slides in the ipython notebook I'm using

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,490
for this talk will be available at the

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,500
link there and my github django con 2017

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,840
it's not available at the moment but it

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,730
will be soon

00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,560
note - so when I turn to look at look at

00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:41,840
the screen turn my body and not my head

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,920
because the way this turn my head this

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,120
is what happens when you you know

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,240
practice this talk with your time you

00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:51,560
realize these finer details so basic

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,910
outline of what the tops going to be

00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,700
talk about how I got here sort of my

00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:58,890
secret origin story I demonstrate some

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,900
of the fundamentals some of the

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,450
fundamental data types that open pi

00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,860
excel gives you and that's because there

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,270
are a few things there that are a little

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,220
non-obvious but then what's to explain

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,619
they seem you recognize how helpful they

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,569
are then we'll take a do a basic demo of

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:14,670
some basic things you can do with Python

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:16,050
and spreadsheets and then we'll look at

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,209
some of the problems that you'll run

00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,489
into trying to use spreadsheets with

00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:22,590
code there are certain things that are

00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:24,930
there are some situations where using a

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,640
spreadsheet with code is straightforward

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,900
and simple but then there are a lot of

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,490
situations where it's not and so I just

00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,190
want to highlight some of those again

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:34,410
the pain of my life as a recovering

00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:39,240
accountant can hopefully benefit you at

00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:40,650
some point so uh secret origin of Kojo I

00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,240
should be professional spreadsheet

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,410
fighter which is also what's known as an

00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,660
accountant

00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,920
lots of spreadsheets all the time you'd

00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,150
be terrified by how many large

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,680
organizations are running spreadsheets

00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,780
but I'd always had an interesting code

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,030
and learning to program but I never

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,850
really needed to as someone who was a

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,709
professional programmer so I decided in

00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,120
late 2012 so you get more serious about

00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:03,450
teaching myself to code and becoming a

00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,280
professional developer and I went pro ie

00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:08,489
got my first development job in December

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,620
of 2015 so that's sort of how I got to

00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:14,310
this point and so my role in the Python

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:16,019
community is such that I've always had

00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,790
an interest in trying to make some sort

00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,110
of a contribution to the community but

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,750
as someone who didn't come from a

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,670
traditional CS background or a coding

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,739
background I knew I wasn't gonna start

00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:28,080
just making contributions by writing

00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,570
awesome code on day one or even early on

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,310
so I thought well I can you know I got

00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,110
decent personal skills and interpersonal

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:38,459
skills so I can maybe help grow the

00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:39,900
community and so I thought one of the

00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:42,750
best ways to grow the Python community

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,370
was not by converting people who used

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,590
other languages into Python developers

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,810
but by taking people who weren't

00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,070
developers and bringing them into the

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,459
Python community by showing them how

00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:55,170
Python can benefit them and for one

00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,450
reason if you're already developing say

00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:00,060
in Java or C++ or what have you you

00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,860
already have your built-in biases but at

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,390
the same time there are more people who

00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,950
aren't programmers than there are people

00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,840
who are programmers you can pour it so

00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,220
it's just a bigger growth factor I'm

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,970
also wanting to look at some solutions

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,049
that are not obviously people who aren't

00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,910
developers so there are certain things

00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:18,289
if you're a developer you think about

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:21,539
things in a certain way when I first

00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:23,160
gave this talk one of the one of these

00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:24,780
solutions to this problem that someone

00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,240
suggested we're just put it in a

00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,890
database well if you already know SQL

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,840
and you'd have access to databases you

00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:34,810
you wouldn't have the problems that I'm

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,340
discussing on this talk so trying to

00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,300
come up with some solutions that are

00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,930
useful to people who aren't already

00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,520
developers so who's the talk for we've

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,710
got to sort of two sets of people the

00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,419
talk is geared at and again I'm trying

00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,740
why not again but if you've read the

00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,790
description you might have seen that I'm

00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,220
trying to make this talk as beginner

00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,930
friendly as possible and so we've got

00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,570
two general categories of people one

00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:57,100
people who are using spreadsheets on a

00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,600
regular basis but want to sort of step

00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,970
their game up want to be able to do some

00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,560
different things with spreadsheets in

00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,820
most cases Excel so they want to be able

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,040
to use some things outside of the norm

00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,479
with the spreadsheet and then the next

00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,610
set of people are people who are already

00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:10,900
Python developers but they keep being

00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,220
given spreadsheets they keep being

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,510
confronted with spreadsheets like well

00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,370
what do I do with these like there's got

00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,840
to be some better way to handle these so

00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:21,070
hopefully this will benefit both sets of

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:23,560
people so the code here is not going to

00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,060
be very advanced again partially because

00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,389
one of this talked to me as beginner

00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:30,280
friendly as possible but also because

00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:32,050
the really interesting things code wise

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,290
are going to be based on your specific

00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,760
application so pulling data out of the

00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,080
spreadsheet writing data back to the

00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,580
spreadsheet those things are fairly

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,080
straightforward there are some other

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,789
things that the library will help you do

00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,979
but they're really interesting things

00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:48,070
are going to be based around your

00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:49,240
specific use case so I can't I don't

00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,729
know what that is and I can't

00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,820
demonstrate that code so I'm showing

00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:56,470
fairly basic code for a couple of basic

00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,289
applications to give you some ideas of

00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:01,690
what can be done so now it's time for

00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:03,490
demo this demo sponsored by Jupiter

00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,700
notebooks Jupiter notebooks purveyor of

00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:08,970
fine internet notebooks since like five

00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,970
years ago

00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:18,140
not that long ago but still very helpful

00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:22,040
so step one that has this read a bunch

00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:35,120
of people in the back yes okay I got a

00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:36,080
kind of I got a too big yes yeah so the

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,140
first thing you have to do is you have

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,460
to know your data and for that we'll

00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:43,820
take a look at the actual spreadsheet

00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:45,470
file it's almost impossible to try to to

00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,150
work with code programmatically we work

00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,170
with a spreadsheet programmatically if

00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,630
you don't know what's in the spreadsheet

00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:55,280
and so here what we've got for my simple

00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:58,310
example and we could I know I don't want

00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,830
help what you do what I say and what you

00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:04,130
to do what I mean at what I say you

00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:07,610
spreadsheet or trouble already there we

00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:09,440
go I'm gonna blame my own mistakes on

00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,870
the spreadsheet that's how that goes so

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,350
what we have here is we have some data

00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:17,030
we have what is some simulated timesheet

00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,940
data so what we have here we have an

00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:22,880
employee number and the employee number

00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,930
identifies each employee so that's the

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,060
same employer this is a different

00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,740
employee an employee number the cost

00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,510
center that that employee worked for so

00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,610
there's sort of this specific work group

00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:33,110
we also have their division within the

00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,870
company so your company is broken into

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:37,910
multiple different divisions and so each

00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:40,310
division will have multiple cost centers

00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:43,100
in it then who is that employees manager

00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:45,919
and of course these are you know fake

00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,419
simulated names and then the date that

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,430
they worked so again this is timesheet

00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:51,410
data so we're seeing here on this date

00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,900
this employee with this name and this

00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:56,390
employee number you won't see the the

00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:59,630
sub moving clear fairly well all right

00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:03,169
so this employee worked one hour on a

00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:07,820
project and so this is simplified data

00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:09,169
just for the purposes if you work in a

00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,880
professional services firm so I've

00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:12,110
worked in accounting firm that in for

00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,300
engineering companies and things of that

00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,460
nature one of the things that they look

00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,789
at is what's called utilization so how

00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:21,410
much time you spend working on an actual

00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:22,160
billable project versus what's called

00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,690
overhead

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,040
where you're at work and you're doing

00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,570
things but you're not working on a

00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,730
specific client project that they can

00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,990
build for for this example everybody's

00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,900
working on the billable project yeah so

00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,800
we're not doing that level of analysis

00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,970
well that's what we've got here so we've

00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,220
got basic timesheet data so this

00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,960
employee worked one hour on a project

00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:41,150
and then they worked three hours on

00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,979
another project the next day so on and

00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:45,190
so forth so I've got about ten thousand

00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:47,300
thousand a thousand rows of data here

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,900
examples that I've worked on before had

00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:52,490
ten fifteen twenty thousand rows of data

00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,720
so this is the basic data and again if

00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,220
you're going to be it's just like

00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,620
anything else in programming if you're

00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,790
going to be writing code and manipulate

00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:02,020
data you need to be familiar with that

00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:05,840
data so here's the basic data we've got

00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:07,460
and then we start with some basics

00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,410
reading a file and some getting some

00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,810
basic datatypes so the library that I'm

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:14,510
using here is called open Pi Excel open

00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:17,030
PI Excel is a library a Python library

00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:19,990
that lets you read from and write to

00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:23,830
xlsx files and for those not familiar

00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:27,350
the the older XLS file format is what

00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:32,330
what Microsoft Word used up until I

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:34,370
believe oh seven and after that they

00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:37,160
switch to the xlsx format and that that

00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:39,890
extra X means that it's it's a based

00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:43,160
around XML and it is compatible with the

00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:47,450
open document organizations formats and

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:49,910
so at the time in 2013 when I started

00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,900
looking at this open Pi Excel was one of

00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,130
the few libraries that would actually

00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,280
work with that file format and that's

00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:57,200
what I had to deal with so again very

00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,630
straightforward stuff you're importing

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,340
open PI X now by show of hands how many

00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:04,400
of you were consider yourselves the

00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:07,790
beginner or novice programmers sort of

00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:11,180
early in early stages okay and so how

00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:12,770
many of you might know some people who

00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,780
would be beginner or novel in that not

00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,460
you yourselves of course but it might

00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,870
know some other people who might be

00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,580
beginner anotherís programmers that

00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,830
might maybe benefit from hearing things

00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:24,260
described in that way okay so yeah so be

00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:26,630
sure to tell a friend and share this

00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,830
with them so I'm trying to stuff through

00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:30,800
this in a fairly straightforward way

00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:32,150
again so that you could explain it to

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,320
someone who's not an experienced

00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,620
developer and they could actually get

00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,300
some benefit from that

00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,490
so Europe importing open PI excel and

00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:43,120
Metro will compile Excel importing

00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:44,260
workbook and this gets you a workbook

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,940
object and we'll talk about that

00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,140
distinction between workbooks and

00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,589
worksheets and that sort of thing later

00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:52,510
and then this line of code workbook

00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:54,820
equals up high Excel that load workbook

00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:56,380
the slope workbook function this is the

00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,149
name of the file that we're using so the

00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:01,180
spreadsheet we that we just saw this

00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:04,839
spreadsheet this is PI excel underscore

00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:08,290
demo underscore Jango Condit xlsx that

00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:09,610
should be that's wrong that should be

00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,920
true I was playing I was playing with

00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:14,649
this earlier the distinction here is

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,149
this data only equals true is for

00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:17,649
situations where you have a formula in a

00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:19,450
spreadsheet which lots of pressures have

00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:21,490
formulas in them if that data only is

00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:23,230
equal to true what that's going to do is

00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:26,290
that's going to give you the result of

00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:29,350
the formula in all cases that supposed

00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:32,170
to bring you back the formula itself so

00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:37,029
that's that and let me I'm just gonna

00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:41,589
run this to make sure I've got

00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:44,320
everything behaving as it should all

00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:45,790
right and so this is all sort of fairly

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,140
straightforward Python stuff except for

00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:49,480
this data only equals true this is

00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,230
something specific to open pi excel so

00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,730
now we're gonna talk about this

00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,490
distinction between workbooks for his

00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:56,529
worksheets or spreadsheets and tabs most

00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,449
people tend to use the terms sort of

00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:00,339
interchangeably they'll say you send me

00:11:58,449 --> 00:12:05,050
a spreadsheet oh no I want that

00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:08,949
spreadsheet in the spreadsheet so in in

00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:11,140
accounting nerd talk a spreadsheet

00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:13,029
there's no is a workbook so Excel

00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,010
describes them as workbook so a workbook

00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:18,310
is the actual file itself so what we see

00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:19,930
here is part of a workbook the

00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,980
individual tabs here I have clean data

00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,660
which is what we're using

00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:27,250
then kpop graphed roster which is a

00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:30,220
whole different thing the kpop was one

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:32,620
of my things so each of these tabs is

00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:36,000
known as they worksheet and the multiple

00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:38,500
worksheets make up a workbook and so

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,709
that is important because when you're

00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,959
using so most people will say like a

00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:46,569
spreadsheet or a tab in a spreadsheet

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:48,100
but open Excel define them in a workbook

00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:49,449
which is a collection of individual

00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,550
worksheets and that's important because

00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:53,980
when you're accessing the data you need

00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:55,449
to tell this you got a workbook file so

00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,310
you want to open that file that's what

00:12:55,449 --> 00:12:58,720
we're opening up here in this cell but

00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,220
then you need to know which worksheet

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,509
you need to get out of that workbook and

00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,630
there are different objects that have

00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:07,660
different properties to them and so here

00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:09,430
we have this WB is the workbook that

00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:13,000
we've opened which is the entire thing

00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:14,410
and for those of you who are again new

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,740
at a Python or who have friends ruin or

00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:19,449
the the dir function the directory

00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,130
function in Python is helpful because it

00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:22,660
will give you a list of the attributes

00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:25,240
that are available for a particular

00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,769
object now for a lot of basic Python

00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,839
constructs if you're already familiar

00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:30,970
with these maybe you don't care but if

00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:32,829
you are using a new library like this

00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,690
like open PI excel it has some different

00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:35,649
data types that you're not going to be

00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,690
familiar with because you haven't seen

00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:40,480
them before so what using the dir

00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:41,319
function on them is helpful and so we

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,310
see a lot of the different attributes

00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:49,269
and we'll notice here a couple sheets

00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:51,100
and so this will show you the sheets

00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:52,660
that are available let's see

00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,610
copy worksheets that you can copy a

00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:58,180
specific worksheet create sheet which

00:13:54,610 --> 00:14:01,240
we'll see a little bit later get sheet

00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:04,120
by name so you can go to it you can grab

00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,079
a specific worksheet or workbook or if

00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,750
you don't know what sheets are available

00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:09,040
to get sheet names and so that will tell

00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:18,870
you okay what sheets are actually here

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:21,399
on this workbook so look at those around

00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:23,920
so that's that and then so I'm here I've

00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:25,269
got the workbook and I print workbook

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,889
that sheet names because I want to know

00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:30,790
what sheet names are there now you will

00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:32,050
notice when we try it's high enough on

00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:35,079
the screen so people can see it you'll

00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,220
notice the workbook got sheet names when

00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:39,189
we looked at the at the actual

00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:42,459
spreadsheet itself we saw two worksheets

00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:44,769
clean data and kpop draft roster but

00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:46,990
when I print the workbook sheet names I

00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:49,389
get three Japan spending clean data and

00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:52,630
kpop graph roster so the Japan spending

00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:54,550
worksheet is actually hidden when as I

00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:56,620
was working on this talk initially I was

00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:58,930
in Japan and I was trying to figure out

00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,000
where all my money had gone and so I

00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,500
started

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,260
I was like well I shouldn't have spent

00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,000
that much money so sho sheet Japan

00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,740
spending so that's a hidden worksheet I

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,150
point that up because if you're in a

00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,350
situation where you're trying to hide

00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,870
something from someone and you want to

00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,790
hide a sheet well if they just look at

00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,110
it they won't see it but if they get a

00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,940
list of the sheet names it's still

00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,860
visible there so those are the

00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,810
worksheets we have available to us the

00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,490
one we want is the clean data worksheet

00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:26,160
and so here I'm going to create this

00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,420
variable called demo worksheet and I

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,710
want to get sheet by name and they

00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:34,230
passed it the worksheet name and so now

00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:37,830
this WB is a a workbook object and

00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:40,830
actually let me do that here a live

00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:43,320
coding portion notice WB it's a workbook

00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:45,180
object again which is not something that

00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,440
natively exists in Python so up in PI

00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,270
Excel that worked would I work with that

00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,920
work work so it's a workbook object and

00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:51,570
it has those different attributes that

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,250
we saw before that's why I have the dir

00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:56,040
so I were in the directory function on

00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:59,190
it and again here I've created this demo

00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:04,200
worksheet which holds a specific

00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:06,930
worksheet and we see that it is a

00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,270
worksheet object it has a specific set

00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:13,170
of attributes that we can see with the

00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:14,400
directory function and so those are the

00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:18,440
different things you can do with it and

00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:24,960
the two we're gonna focus on most here

00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:26,400
all right well so we've got cell so you

00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,520
can get a particular cell from worksheet

00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:36,620
but we're gonna look at I just passed it

00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:38,460
columns and rows so each worksheet again

00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,780
depending on how from the yard with it

00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:42,450
what the worksheet columns go up and

00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:44,490
down rows go side to side in this case

00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:47,089
each row represents a particular record

00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:49,080
like similar to in a relational database

00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:52,940
so those are the different attributes

00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:55,500
we've got for the worksheet object and

00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,580
these workbook and worksheet objects and

00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,810
the cell obvious we'll see you later

00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,460
there are a lot of different attributes

00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,450
a lot of different options there's

00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,800
clearly not time to go through all of

00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:05,579
them but I'm just going to try to go

00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:07,350
over some of the highlights so we've got

00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:09,120
this worksheet now this demo worksheet

00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:10,199
and so we went is we want the data out

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,650
of this and we're going to grab it by

00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:16,230
rows and so demo worksheet

00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:17,760
that rose so so what are the rows here

00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:20,790
and you'll notice it returns this

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,970
generator object so generator object

00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:26,970
worksheet dot sells by row and so what

00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:29,400
this does is it gives us a generator

00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:31,110
object instead of reading every row out

00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,370
of this spreadsheet it creates a

00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:34,880
generator object and if you are not

00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:37,350
familiar with generators a simple a

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,690
simpler way to think about them is that

00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:43,680
a generator object is something that has

00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:45,450
a a collection of items but instead of

00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,760
giving you all those items at once it

00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:49,650
will give them to you one at a time and

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,020
this helps to save memory so instead of

00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:54,480
having all 10,000 rows of this

00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,920
spreadsheet if you have this generator

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,540
Rodrik that what gives you one row at a

00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,370
time is needed and that helps to save

00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:01,920
memory I mean but I've point that out

00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,870
because if you say okay will show me the

00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,490
rows you're not going to just get plain

00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,330
rows of plain text or things of that

00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,800
nature you're going to get this

00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:14,210
generator object it's going to give you

00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:14,210
a row at a time and so

00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:28,539
okay so what you get is when you print

00:18:27,219 --> 00:18:31,419
out this generator advocate again so

00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:33,609
this demoed at work she does so for row

00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:35,200
in demo dot worksheet row so I want to

00:18:33,609 --> 00:18:37,419
see what these roads are like and you'll

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,570
notice that each row I've also got it

00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:42,070
printing the type and so you've got a

00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:45,239
generator object but what it returns

00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:49,059
each object it returns is a tuple of

00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:53,320
cells and so you got this cell clean

00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:56,799
data a-1 clean di do so cell a1 cell b1

00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:59,679
cell c1 of this clean data worksheet and

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:03,909
so a1 b1 c1 that's going to correspond

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:05,080
to the first row and then the next one

00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:08,349
goes to the second row and so on and so

00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,940
forth and so you have a tuple so this

00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:13,960
generated rod which is giving you tuples

00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:15,639
and each element of that tuple is a cell

00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,249
which is again so a tuple standard

00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:20,409
Python data construct a cell is not a

00:19:18,249 --> 00:19:22,479
cells another open PI Excel data

00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:24,549
contract and we'll see why that's

00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:28,239
important in useful in just a moment so

00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:29,679
we move on we take a look at cells and

00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:33,759
just want to show you some of the

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:36,940
differences about cells so so for a cell

00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:40,149
in next demo demo worksheet data row so

00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:41,859
again demo worksheet that rows into a

00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:43,570
generator object if you have a generator

00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:46,719
I'd rate like I said it gives you one

00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:48,969
new item at a time to get one item at a

00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:50,919
time you can use this next function and

00:19:48,969 --> 00:19:52,899
so that's just pulling one item out of

00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:54,759
that generator at a time and so I'm

00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:58,059
having it print out just cell and then

00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:59,289
the cell name so he excelled that column

00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:00,909
because it tells me what column the

00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:02,739
cells in cell dot row tells me what row

00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:04,659
the cell is in using some string

00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:07,029
formatting here to make that look sort

00:20:04,659 --> 00:20:08,409
of nice and then I'm printing the cell

00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:10,389
itself which gives me information about

00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:11,979
the cell then the type of cell gets to

00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:14,259
demonstrate that it's this different

00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:16,149
data it's this different data type it's

00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:18,940
not native to Python it's provided by

00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:22,570
the library so cell a1 so then what we

00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:25,239
clean data it's of the type cell and the

00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:26,799
value in it that last line is going to

00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:27,759
show you what's actually in that cells

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,679
like when you look at a spreadsheet

00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:32,750
that's what you're after after you after

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,870
the cell dot data and so we see a

00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:41,420
the value is employee num v1 it's cost

00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:43,760
Center c1 its division so so this Rho 1

00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:46,580
these are the headers and so on and so

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,710
forth until we move on so I just popped

00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:51,920
off that top row just to demonstrate

00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:54,559
that and so we've got these cell values

00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:59,090
and types in now open PI Excel is also

00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:00,320
smart enough to try to take the data

00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:02,510
that's in a Cell

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,790
the values that are in a cell and

00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:06,830
convert them to the appropriate Python

00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:10,429
data type so here we're looking at demo

00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:12,350
worksheet II 1 dot value and so I also

00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:14,059
do this to demonstrate that instead of

00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:15,710
grabbing things just by rows you can go

00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:17,179
to a specific cell if you want to so in

00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:19,929
this case we're going to this demo

00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:24,200
worksheet which is the clean data

00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:26,120
worksheet and we're grabbing cell a1 and

00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,920
we're getting its value and we're doing

00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:32,030
the same thing to sell e 2 so if we take

00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:37,760
a look at the spreadsheet cell e14

00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:40,640
e 2 is that first date and so we print

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,720
these and these two cells 80 and 180 181

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,640
are basically the same thing just

00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:47,480
showing differently so that's the value

00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:49,309
and M s the type so the value here is

00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,800
this date working with the string the

00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:54,830
value here is that first date so it's

00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,030
showing it it's displaying it here but

00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:58,280
it's also showing you that it's a date

00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:01,040
time that date time object and so python

00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:05,570
knows that hey this is a date and so

00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:07,130
that's useful so cell attributes again

00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:08,300
so why is there cell a trick just like

00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,890
we had the workbook in the worksheet

00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,630
object we have the cell object that have

00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:16,970
all these different attributes and the

00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:19,070
primary reason for that is because when

00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:20,660
you're looking at a spreadsheet and it's

00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:22,550
the cell object when you're looking at a

00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:24,650
spreadsheet there's a lot more going on

00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:26,600
than just what's in the cell the cell

00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:29,600
itself it than just the value there are

00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,070
other attributes so is it is it bold

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,750
real sort of styling is going on

00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:34,780
whatever you know things are happening

00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:38,980
with the cell and so these cell objects

00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:38,980
contain all those other attributes

00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:49,770
and the one that we're going to use the

00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:51,510
most here is the value attribute so

00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:53,040
we'll be doing cell value to give the

00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:54,060
actual value of that's the actual data

00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,520
we're wanting to work with

00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:58,020
however there's other data in the cell

00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,510
so if you need to know if a cell is

00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:02,190
colored a certain way or uses a certain

00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:03,660
type of font or something like that you

00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,400
can grab that information and do things

00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:07,590
with it as well but for our purposes

00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:11,490
we'll be focusing mostly on that you

00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:13,620
look at cell Styles music substyles

00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:15,750
there's not enough time to really for me

00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,740
to do a demo on the cell style but there

00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,750
are all sorts of things you can do

00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,640
working with styles open pie excel

00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:23,730
documentation is of course on read the

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,860
docs thank you area culture for making

00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,780
things like this available for us so

00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:30,480
there's a lot of style information and

00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:32,330
while that might not seem like the most

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,980
important things when dealing with data

00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:36,450
one you might be in a situation where

00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,970
the spreadsheets that you are given are

00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:40,860
being styled in a certain way so maybe a

00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:43,110
number that's a loss is read and a

00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,640
number that's you know a profit is green

00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:46,800
or something like that you can actually

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,540
make use of that information so you can

00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,710
actually pull that out and if you're

00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,970
needing to write your results to a

00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:53,070
spreadsheet you can write them in that

00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:54,240
fashion as well so making beautiful

00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,700
spreadsheets has been left as an

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,100
exercise for the viewer so I'll let you

00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,830
do that on your own so example one

00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:04,020
aggregating timesheet info but we're

00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:07,170
basically want to do here is take this

00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:10,290
timesheet and instead of having these

00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:12,390
individual lines for each day what we

00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:14,190
want is we want to see okay how much

00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:17,340
time did each employee work in this

00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:18,360
month so this is June or 2017 so we want

00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,920
to see okay how much time to reach

00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:23,130
employee work in this month so we want

00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:26,540
to aggregate that information a lot of

00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:29,250
the Python here is just it's not

00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:31,560
particularly impressive but I wanted to

00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:33,180
point out the spots where we use regular

00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:38,630
Python make for things that are specific

00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:41,280
to open PI Excel so here you can use a

00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:43,020
for-loop versus a set comprehension I

00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,330
use the set comprehension because I

00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:47,250
wanted to be able to I wanted a set of

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,600
the employee ideas I didn't want every

00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,620
occurrence of an employee ID because you

00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,920
have multiple so I use the set

00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:54,530
comprehension here

00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:57,620
trade hunter who is here at the

00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:59,780
conference does an exceptional talk on

00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:02,000
but he hosts comprehensive with

00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:03,710
comprehensions and so you can take a

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,910
look you can I guess you see Trey ask

00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,630
him and tell him I told you that your

00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:10,010
tray here no you probably in that room

00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:11,360
so if you see Trey asked him about

00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:13,130
copper connectors and tell him that Kojo

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,420
told you to ask him and so he'll do a

00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:17,510
better job of explaining comprehensions

00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:18,800
then I will but what you would do with a

00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:20,480
nested for loop in a lot of cases you

00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,880
can do with the comprehension so here

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,740
I'm creating this set comprehension of

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,710
employee IDs just so I have a list of

00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:31,520
the unique employee IDs and that's what

00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:34,640
this looks like here and then I'm using

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:37,310
that set that I call the employee IDs

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:41,360
one and I'm using that to create a

00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:43,460
dictionary that takes the hours I'm

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,350
using list comprehensions here list and

00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,730
set comprehensions here I want to I want

00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:49,970
all the hours for that employee

00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:51,380
I want a set comprehension of the cost

00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:52,970
Center each employee should only work in

00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,430
one cost center so here I've got a set

00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:56,600
comprehension of one cost center a set

00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,680
comprehension their divisions again each

00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,390
pollution on they work for one division

00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,010
ething employee should only have one

00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:02,780
manager so this is again the part about

00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:04,750
knowing your data so I got set copy

00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:09,860
hunches that are building those things

00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:13,970
you'll notice here I got row six dot

00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:19,540
value for rowing demo worksheet rows so

00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:23,480
in this case demo worksheet dot rose is

00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:25,370
again that that generator object that's

00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:29,720
giving us a row to time so here I'm

00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:30,740
saying I want row index six four hours

00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,010
if we take a look back at our

00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:36,380
spreadsheet we can see one two three

00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:39,410
four five six seven

00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:40,610
because spreadsheet so and so and this

00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,230
this is way gets a little tricky we'll

00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:44,900
see this later

00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:46,730
Python indexes from zero so if you have

00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,230
a list of four items Python will count

00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:50,510
them is zero one two or three

00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:52,400
spreadsheets indexed from one and so

00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:53,600
we'll see in the code a little bit later

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,270
when you have to make that adjustment so

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:59,910
here index zero one two three four

00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:02,840
okay Mikey zero one two three four or

00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:06,270
five six so I'm getting the hours there

00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:08,670
but I'm using that wrote value row six

00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:11,310
the row index X which is gonna be a sell

00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:12,450
object in the row then dot value so I'm

00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:14,160
pulling the value out of that mess

00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:15,720
what's getting me my hours doing the

00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:22,140
same thing to get the cost Center the

00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:23,670
division and the manager I I do QA where

00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:26,610
I work now and I actually used to be an

00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:27,840
auditor or so I tend to try to you want

00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,280
to test things and things that nature so

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,480
I've got a little assertion here because

00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,520
I know there should only be one cost

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,050
center one division and what a manager

00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:38,520
for employee so I just do that there and

00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:43,380
then I build this employee aggregate

00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:45,390
object and again so a lot of this is

00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:49,290
regular Python here I've got some of the

00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:52,920
specifics to up in PI Excel and then I

00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:54,750
print this employee aggregate object

00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,430
just a pretty print it it's a dictionary

00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:59,910
just so it's clear so what you end up

00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:02,010
with is an employee ID as the key and

00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:03,060
then the cost center of the division and

00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:07,140
then the number of hours for that

00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:09,270
employee and so this lets me take this

00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:11,820
spreadsheet turn it into a dictionary

00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:16,470
which could also be used as a as a JSON

00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:17,580
object and I know from some filtering of

00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:19,470
the spreadsheets and manual filter

00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,270
stretchy that but I should have 49

00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:23,010
employees and so that's what's happening

00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:26,190
here

00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:28,260
now here we've looked at reading data

00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:29,520
from a spreadsheet and then processing

00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:32,280
it and turning it into something in

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,660
Python the next thing becomes what if

00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,760
you've already got a Python program

00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,290
that's running and you want those

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,430
results to be written to a spreadsheet

00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,980
well you can do the same thing with a

00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:42,810
papaya Excel so first you need to create

00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:45,720
a workbook and I've give it a very

00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:48,750
creative name of output book and so I've

00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:51,300
created this new workbook object called

00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:53,850
output book and then you need to create

00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:55,530
well let's say you can create a specific

00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:58,470
sheet here I'm creating a sheet called

00:28:55,530 --> 00:29:00,300
output sheet so output book dot create

00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:02,370
sheet which is a this create sheet is a

00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:04,620
method that belongs to the workbook

00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:06,750
object and I'm giving it a name here

00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:09,240
aggregate time and I'm also giving it

00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:11,049
this argument as zero the zero argument

00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,630
means it's going to be the zero

00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:15,340
in the workbook otherwise by default

00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:16,809
when you create a workbook it will have

00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:19,030
a big sheet one of the first object so

00:29:16,809 --> 00:29:22,000
here I'm saying make this the first item

00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:23,470
in the sheet that we see and then we

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,250
look at output book we see that it's

00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:30,010
this a workbook type object then I

00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:31,419
decide to build a header because I don't

00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:33,039
want to just write the raw data to the

00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:35,350
spreadsheet I also want some sort of a

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,760
header so the spreadsheet looks sort of

00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:38,260
organized when I give it someone else so

00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,559
they can understand it and so I'm just

00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:43,120
building a header here basically by

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,530
copying the values out of the demo

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,250
worksheet and so again I'm just

00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:49,240
accessing those cells directly and then

00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:51,190
I'm printing the header to make sure

00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,280
it's it's what I want and so I've got

00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:56,650
that same header and then for output

00:29:54,280 --> 00:30:00,460
data I build this table it's it's a list

00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:02,950
of Lists and I move through this

00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:04,840
employee aggregate and I'm creating new

00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:07,030
row I'm building these new rows so I

00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,320
want the row with the employee that cost

00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:10,120
Center the division their manager and

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,530
their number of hours but here it's

00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:15,580
going to be the number of hours that

00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:18,549
were aggregated from the earlier

00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:23,020
dictionary that we saw and then he now

00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:26,799
I'm assigning those values that are in

00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:31,059
this output data construct I'm writing

00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:33,960
them to the output sheet and I'm I've

00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:36,220
got a nested I got nested for-loops here

00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:40,270
because I'm writing them by row and by

00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:43,679
cell and here we see excuse me we see

00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:47,919
this row index that I've got here and

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:50,530
the column number but I've got to use +1

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,299
because the index is they come from

00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:54,940
Python start with 0 on especially there

00:30:52,299 --> 00:30:56,830
start with 1 so that writes that stuff

00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:59,140
and so here is the output data

00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:01,450
constructs that I built and so you see

00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:04,059
the first list is the header and the

00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:05,230
next list is the aggregate numbers for

00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:06,789
each employee so this employer worked

00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:15,220
hundred 60 hours in the month so on and

00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:17,980
so forth so and now I can save that so

00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:20,920
output book that save and then I give it

00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:43,030
a file name and so this is the file name

00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:49,090
of the file that is being written to and

00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:52,170
so this is the result and now this

00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:55,000
doesn't take a huge amount of time but

00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:57,040
it's a small amount of data so there's

00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,170
this so I've got this aggregate time

00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:02,260
sheet with those times and I can check

00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:03,700
the totals so the total there is well

00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:05,080
you can't see it at the bottom it's five

00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,750
hundred and five thousand three hundred

00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:13,360
eighty six hours and if I go back to the

00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:14,710
original spreadsheet I've got the same

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,900
total five thousand three hundred eighty

00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:18,490
six hours which is cute the bottom

00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:26,740
perhaps through the book people the

00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:28,780
front row and again this isn't the the

00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:31,600
most complicated of things but it gives

00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:33,880
you an idea of if you have a lot more

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:37,180
spreadsheets to work with ten or 100 or

00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:39,610
you have a lot more data the last thing

00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:41,530
we do is I can take that object at

00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:44,650
aggregate time my object that I created

00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:51,490
and I can write it out as a JSON file

00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:55,290
and so then what I end up with is this

00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:55,290
where's my different file there we go

00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:06,370
and so I get that as a JSON file that I

00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:12,240
can then use to configure something else

00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:16,210
or to do other processing if I'd like so

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:18,250
the problems that you'll run into so the

00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:20,170
reading of reading the data writing the

00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:21,580
data that sort of thing not terribly

00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:23,410
complicated the problems that you run

00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:25,559
into is it often a spreadsheet is going

00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:27,549
to be used as a visual medium and so

00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:30,429
someone wants a spreadsheet to look nice

00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:32,950
and so that spreadsheet might not make

00:33:30,429 --> 00:33:34,900
sense to code if if the only spreadsheet

00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:35,740
you edit you ever get is one that looks

00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:38,169
like this

00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:39,940
then you'll be fine because you've got

00:33:38,169 --> 00:33:42,370
fairly well structured data but the

00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,660
reality is some of the boss wants the

00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:45,490
spreadsheet to look a certain way and so

00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,660
it's been laid out they've tried to do

00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,950
desktop publishing with it or whatever

00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:51,580
and then you've got to sort of go

00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:53,770
through it in those situations you might

00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:56,470
be able to access individual cells or

00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:58,630
you may be able to convince them to

00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:00,010
maybe change some of the formatting with

00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:02,679
the idea that hey we can speed this up

00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:04,240
by literally a hundred times so if you

00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:05,799
might have visual input or you might

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,470
have a visual output requirement that

00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:10,540
for standing can help you if you make

00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:12,310
new friends by helping teach your

00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:14,350
coworker how to automate some of their

00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:16,030
simple tasks with Python again the

00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:17,470
Python here that I demonstrated wasn't

00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,700
terribly complicated that the

00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:20,649
comprehensions were probably the most

00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,909
complicated thing and so you can choose

00:34:20,649 --> 00:34:25,409
none to read data and do some things

00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:25,409
with it and we write the data back out

00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:31,260
that's what I've got so I am transition

00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:33,820
on Twitter if you have questions or the

00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:41,619
slides and the code will be available in

00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:44,260
this github repository very shortly with

00:34:41,619 --> 00:34:46,600
the the Python CSV module you're able to

00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:49,869
use dict reader and actually get named

00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:52,419
columns in and out does open pi excel

00:34:49,869 --> 00:34:54,760
support that i'm not sure if it supports

00:34:52,419 --> 00:34:57,129
the name column it will let you so here

00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,420
I read in I read things in by row but

00:34:57,129 --> 00:35:02,710
you can also do the same thing by

00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:03,850
columns okay you mentioned that visual

00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,410
spreadsheets would not be a good

00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:07,359
candidate for this sort of approach are

00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:09,520
there any types of actual data

00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:11,680
structures in spreadsheets that you that

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,380
would not be good for programmatic

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,630
analysis this way data structures in

00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:20,750
spreadsheet

00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:23,080
hmm let's see so if you have a lot of

00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:26,120
computations being happening in macros

00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:28,070
and that's something I had not worked

00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:30,290
with very much but if you've got a lot

00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:32,950
of macro calculations going on that

00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:35,510
might be a little tricky but if you can

00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:37,430
you should be able to grab either the

00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:39,260
data that's going into that macro or the

00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:41,510
results of those macro calculations so

00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:43,670
that's probably what you'd want there's

00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:45,890
a whole different approach that involves

00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:47,300
being able to run Python inside of a

00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:49,340
spreadsheet I might add that to this

00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:53,570
talk and update it later but this far

00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:55,490
I've worked on just the is there any way

00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:57,260
to make pivot tables in it I know you

00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:59,180
can do pandas you could do a pivot table

00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:02,890
and pandas and write it statically to

00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:05,300
the excel sheet but is there any way to

00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:08,090
if you're looking to because it's in my

00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:14,360
mind all this stuff kind of gets rid of

00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:16,430
BBA documentation I believe there is a

00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,780
pivot table function that's there I'll

00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:20,030
stuff my head I can't recall I

00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:22,520
personally am sort of a sort of a

00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:25,370
love-hate village with pivot tables okay

00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:28,040
yeah just before I ask and ask my

00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:32,090
question I worked a lot with POI and if

00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:34,700
you make a pivot table and then make it

00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:36,110
use a range you can actually use

00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,820
something like this to populate your

00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:40,820
pivot table so you can sort of have a

00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:45,560
pivot table as a question for you is

00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:46,760
streaming like and and stability so have

00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,440
you noticed any bugs or instability

00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,000
problems and then when you're dealing

00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,080
with large amounts of data is there any

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,760
streaming interface that you're familiar

00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:55,400
with any anything

00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:58,640
comments on that not with the streaming

00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:03,950
interface so I haven't used this

00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:05,540
recently with huge amounts of data so I

00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:07,430
think the fact that it's not pulling in

00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:09,980
in time I've seen large spreadsheets

00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:12,260
that have caused Excel itself to sort of

00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:14,810
slow down and run slowly and so I

00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:16,100
haven't run this with those same because

00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:18,140
those unfortunately were

00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:20,240
bitterly formatted but I think the fact

00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:22,010
that this is creating this generator

00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,480
object and returning the data in small

00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:24,530
pieces at a time would help alleviate

00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,180
some other issues but I haven't actually

00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:27,920
had a chance to test it I need to I need

00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,710
to create a fake thing with a bunch of

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,490
data and try that

00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:35,510
I so your your Excel was pretty nicely

00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:39,210
obviously formatted would it deal with

00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:41,280
cells or rows that are merged in front

00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:44,430
in the middle of the sheets for example

00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,920
a merge cell of Monday days of the V

00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:48,809
console it has some capacity to deal

00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,900
with that but again that's sort of a

00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:53,520
knowing your data type of thing and I

00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:55,800
haven't specifically tried things with

00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,150
yourself but you can you can access

00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,710
individual cells so that might be a

00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:00,690
situation where you might need to access

00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:04,680
an individual stuff because I'm not sure

00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:06,480
how open PI Excel sort of use that look

00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,760
visually just like with the hidden a

00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,170
worksheet you can't see they didn't

00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,030
worksheet but open PI X oh I can see it

00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:14,280
another sheet names so I'm not sure how

00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:15,869
open PI X L sees those because the

00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,910
merging is just a visual thing it's not

00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:22,140
an actual data thing have you ever used

00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:24,359
Excel Rd or exile WT and how does it

00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:25,619
compare to so this is one of the more

00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:28,410
common questions I get with this talk

00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:30,270
I've used those a little bit but when I

00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:33,599
started when I started using this

00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:36,450
library at the time this is 2013 so

00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,970
those two libraries to excel excel Rd

00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:41,970
and Excel WT they wouldn't work with

00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:44,280
xlsx files and so I think I believe now

00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:45,690
they do but at the time they wouldn't

00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,059
and so I played with them a little bit

00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:50,130
but like oh well I can't I use that to

00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:52,079
take out every spreadsheet convert it to

00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:55,220
an XLS file and use this or I can just

00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:58,230
use a library that supports it natively

00:38:55,220 --> 00:39:00,270
thank you I'm gonna reveal reveal my

00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:03,329
ignorance real quick but what tool were

00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:06,780
you using to run your Python and a

00:39:03,329 --> 00:39:08,880
browser and trust the output that was do

00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:12,589
you put notebooks this just talks about

00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:15,990
to buy up your notebook purveyor of fine

00:39:12,589 --> 00:39:17,150
so Jupiter notebook all right seeing

00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:24,639
none thank you coach Oh

00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:24,639
