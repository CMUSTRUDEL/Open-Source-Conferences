[Music]

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,270
okay so I'm Kelsey Holley I spent the

00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,790
last seven weeks at girls who code and I

00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,619
wanted to share that experience so if

00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:26,110
you haven't heard of girls who code it

00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:27,910
was founded by Reshma like many of us

00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:30,910
she noticed the gender gap in the

00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:33,550
computer sciences and technology and

00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,110
what she saw was that many young girls

00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:38,200
are actually very interested in computer

00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:40,000
programming and computer scientists but

00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,800
as they get older that number kind of

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,460
drops by the time when they get to

00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,470
college there's very few of them left so

00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,240
she came up with two different ways to

00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,340
kind of get girls interested and keep

00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,380
them interested in computer science so

00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,990
one of them is after-school clubs these

00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,790
are for six to 12th graders who hang out

00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,890
maybe in a teacher's classroom they get

00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:02,470
exposure to computer science and some of

00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,239
the fundamentals and the other is the

00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,759
summer immersion program which is a

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,170
seven week program over the summer for

00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:10,420
tenth and eleventh graders where they

00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,040
cover the fundamentals have been built

00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,229
various programs and bunch of different

00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,689
languages also give some exposure to

00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:22,179
many different women in tech as well as

00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:25,679
the jobs in tech so this is me and my

00:01:22,179 --> 00:01:30,039
two TAS for the summer Kim and Jen and

00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:32,829
we tried to encourage sisterhood as well

00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:34,389
as the qualities here that are you know

00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:36,490
making our girls brave and resilient

00:01:34,389 --> 00:01:39,009
socially just emotionally intelligent

00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:40,780
intellectually curious so everything we

00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:42,520
did would really encourage the girls to

00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,700
feel this about themselves and embody

00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,799
these these things so the first language

00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,909
we taught them was actually scratch so

00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:51,219
you can kind of see on the screen

00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:53,020
there's the little cat icon they had it

00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:55,209
drawing pictures if you're not familiar

00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,590
with scratch it's a block kind of puzzle

00:01:55,209 --> 00:02:00,340
like language that teaches them about

00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:03,700
conditionals functions all the basics of

00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,920
programming after scratch we went into

00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:09,069
Python and so they how they were drawing

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,240
shapes with the the turtle library soon

00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:13,270
they were writing their own text

00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:16,120
adventures and by the next project they

00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,950
were using the pillow library to dissect

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,349
the pixels in an image and put a filter

00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,240
on it and I thought some of the coolest

00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:25,090
images were actually mistakes in their

00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,450
code so the the blurry one here is

00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,160
actually one of the

00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,170
whistles was not written to the file and

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,280
so it created this kind of crazy-looking

00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:36,980
image then they learned Arduino they

00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,650
were playing with the LED lights and

00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:43,010
they were also hopefully these will load

00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,630
yes they also taught them to dance and

00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:50,780
sing a song which I don't have the audio

00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:52,489
for plugged in that's okay they we did a

00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,110
lot of code reviews together so we went

00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:56,629
through their code we debugged it as a

00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:58,310
class we went over some things that wow

00:02:56,629 --> 00:03:00,799
you did this really well your peers

00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:03,080
could really learn from this the video

00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:05,000
showing is actually our skate bot so

00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,500
they had sensors on it and as it ran

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,440
into walls it was supposed to kind of

00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,360
back up and get through the maze there

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,110
was a little bit buggy it just wanted to

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:18,860
really rug into walls you know that was

00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:21,260
part of the fun we also taught them HTML

00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,090
CSS and JavaScript some of them came out

00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,209
of the summer with a really well done

00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:27,290
professional-looking portfolio site some

00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:32,450
of them still look like something I

00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:34,010
built in the 90s you know it's fun we

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,260
had them do journals through everyday

00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:39,380
kind of documenting their their journey

00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,970
in their process and we covered what we

00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,489
called the core four so we taught them

00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:45,440
variables we taught them loops and

00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:47,510
conditionals and we taught them

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,980
functions and I'm not gonna lie these

00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,519
screenshots I actually stole from one of

00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:54,889
my students web sites so there you go

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:57,019
and finally the last two weeks we had

00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:58,910
them focusing on final projects so they

00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:00,380
came up with various ideas of what they

00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,870
wanted to build for the last two weeks

00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,920
of the program and then they picked what

00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:07,100
they wanted to work on as a group

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,329
together and so once they had their

00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,040
group I think I had five different

00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:11,930
groups total once they had their group

00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,769
we had them wireframe and storyboard

00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:17,720
what they wanted to build at the very

00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:19,940
end when they had built that they've had

00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,799
a poster board here that had their

00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,120
inspirations their process along the way

00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:24,860
the problem they were trying to tackle

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,039
as well as the solution that they came

00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:30,410
up with one of the projects was called

00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:31,970
nuage and it was a chatbot that some of

00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,250
my girls built for the depressed the

00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,510
lonely and the upset

00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:39,830
another one was environ to encourage

00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:40,370
your cycling my favorite part my my TA

00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,750
actually

00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,729
have this from her time at girls who

00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,490
code we had a stuffed animal named

00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:47,990
Aurora and she was the stuffed animal we

00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,060
gave out every day to a different girl

00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:53,479
who embodied one of the four concepts

00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:55,190
and these are various pictures of them

00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:58,729
with Aurora maybe that night with pets

00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:59,960
with hobbies and at the very end we

00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:01,669
actually gave each girl their own

00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,310
individual Aurora so if you see me

00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:06,650
taking pictures with mine around that's

00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,810
what it's about so I encourage you to

00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:12,500
all get involved it was a great summer

00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:14,780
for me join a local club be a mentor yes

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,980
classroom sponsor be a teacher

00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,980
[Music]

00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,130
hello I am Eric oh sure you might know

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,350
me from read the docs and or write the

00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,840
docs world today I'm going to be talking

00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,979
about the Python Software Foundation

00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,100
please raise your hand if you know what

00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:35,690
the Python Software Foundation is keep

00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,500
your hand up if you know what the Python

00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:43,010
Software Foundation does all right so

00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,780
about 70 60 70 percent so my talk today

00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:48,550
is what is the Python Software

00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:51,470
Foundation and why should I care so

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:53,539
credit for most of these goes to Eva who

00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,889
is our kind of coordinator she's really

00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:57,169
you can think of her as the CEO of the

00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:59,270
PSF she's given talks you've seen her

00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:02,110
she also helps run Python but a lot of

00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:08,830
this data and anecdotes come from her

00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:08,830
so really the PSF is us the PSF is you

00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,780
anyone who spends five hours a month

00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,460
working on python related community

00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,860
projects writing documentation writing

00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,780
code helping people and IRC really just

00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:24,830
doing anything that furthers the mission

00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:26,690
of python in any way is eligible to

00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:28,729
become a member of the PSF so if that's

00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:31,550
you you can go into Python org or just

00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:33,289
Google you know Python PSF and you can

00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,780
find out more information about joining

00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:38,300
the PSF so what is being a member of the

00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,860
PSF mean that means you get to elect the

00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,840
board of directors the board of

00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:45,229
directors are the people who actually

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,520
run the PSF I learned this by being

00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:49,789
elected to the board of directors about

00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,229
two months ago so I'm still figuring out

00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:53,360
how all the stuff works and I'm trying

00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:53,870
to explain it to folks as well because

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,730
the PS

00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:58,100
is a really really kind of special

00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:00,590
organization not many other software

00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,020
languages have organizations behind them

00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:05,180
to do all the good work that we do to

00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,910
increase diversity to make events happen

00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,620
all this kind of stuff so all the

00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:11,450
membership to the PSF votes it's

00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,970
basically a democracy you select the

00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:16,610
board then the board oversees the staff

00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:18,200
the PSF has five full time staff who

00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:22,160
work on operating the Python Software

00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:24,890
Foundation so what is the PSF actually

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,920
do what are the operations that happen

00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:30,860
inside the PSF the big thing the PSF

00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,030
does is run pike on us so the big Python

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,480
conference that just happened in

00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:37,940
Portland it had 3,500 people the PSF

00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,350
actually runs that event Django and

00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,770
Django Khan are actually run by a

00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:45,350
separate nonprofit so the DSF and Daphna

00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:47,630
are separate nonprofits so django con is

00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:50,300
run independently of the DSF that's one

00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:52,490
of the big differences the PSF and the

00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,160
DSF are similar also in that we hold the

00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:58,280
IP rights for the language so the

00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:01,730
trademark of the word Python is held by

00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:04,430
the PSF Django is held by the DSF we

00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:07,310
also hold as the PSF the PyCon trademark

00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,840
pilotis trademarks both in the US in

00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,030
Europe and other places so we're kind of

00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,620
the legal entity that says when somebody

00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,880
talks about Python they're actually

00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,310
talking about the programming language

00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,140
that we release on python.org that is

00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,780
like so you know what you're talking

00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:22,760
about when you get Python the other big

00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:25,070
thing that we do so PyCon every year

00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,350
makes money that funds the operations of

00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:29,450
the PSF and we also give a large amount

00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:32,540
of that money away so in the last year I

00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:35,960
believe in 2016 we gave over 250,000

00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:38,270
dollars in grants to conferences so the

00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,400
Django con is sponsored by the PSF that

00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:42,770
was done through a grant almost a

00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,080
majority of all django girls events all

00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:48,380
across the world are sponsored by the

00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,580
PSF almost every Python conference all

00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,740
the regional events all the

00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:54,470
international events are supported by

00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,900
the PSF so we bootstrap a lot of events

00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:59,360
we bootstrap a lot of communities we

00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,650
really try and give money to places that

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,660
are really gonna have an impact in

00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:04,880
growing the diversity and just the

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,250
global outreach of the Python language

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,769
and last year we actually gave money to

00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,230
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:12,119
different countries to support the

00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,600
Python communities in those countries so

00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:17,489
that's one of the big things that we do

00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,259
so how can you get involved with the PSF

00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:20,939
you know by being a django con you're

00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:23,459
almost certainly doing five months five

00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:25,889
hours a month of work on Django or

00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:27,569
Python or anything like that you can

00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:29,220
join a working group so we have a few

00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:30,509
different two working groups do you can

00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,759
join that do different things in the

00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:34,860
community you can become a member and

00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:36,899
actually vote and choose who the board

00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,360
is choose who is kind of directing the

00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:40,709
PSF you can run for the board if you

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,970
think you know what the PSF should be

00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:45,119
doing and you actually know stuff about

00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:46,980
nonprofits unlike me you can also

00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:49,139
convince your company to donate to the

00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,759
Python or Django software foundations so

00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:52,860
that we continue doing this good work

00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:56,600
you can also volunteer at PyCon or

00:09:52,860 --> 00:10:00,239
Django Cohn or any of these other things

00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:02,069
okay last thing we can also do more like

00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:04,019
the PSF is just this kind of thing

00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:06,119
that's giving out money I really want

00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:08,910
the vision of the PSF to be more than

00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:09,569
that to help operate things like pip pi

00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,639
PI

00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:13,350
those things currently have no like

00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:15,660
official funding so that's something I'm

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:17,189
really trying to work on last thing you

00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,819
should come to PI cascades which is in

00:10:17,189 --> 00:10:21,329
Vancouver

00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:24,649
January 22nd and 23rd so more Northwest

00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,649
awesome things thank you

00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:30,459
hopefully nothing else will go wrong my

00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,709
name is Laura Hampton

00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:36,759
I am a Python developer in New York City

00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:39,399
and I am somewhat involved with Pi video

00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:45,129
org which is the index site for Python

00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:47,350
videos a lot of the Python conferences

00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:48,850
put up their videos and a lot of the

00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,949
times they wind up on YouTube or some

00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:53,829
other video site the thing is it can be

00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:55,600
very hard to find the videos and define

00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:58,059
videos by specific speakers or on

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,649
specific topics because YouTube is full

00:10:58,059 --> 00:11:03,519
of things like cat videos and videos

00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:05,439
about makeup and monster trucks so we've

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:10,720
created by video to make Python videos

00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:12,850
easier to find this is our home page you

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,079
can see talks from past conferences you

00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,489
can see conference talks from

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,529
conferences that you could not attend

00:11:15,489 --> 00:11:19,509
for whatever reason you can see con

00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:21,999
talks from conferences on the other side

00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:23,559
of the world and you can do the whole

00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:27,779
eye track without guilt because you can

00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:32,169
go back and watch videos later we have

00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:35,470
talks organized by tags that's our main

00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:41,289
tags page for your convenience and we

00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:43,359
have the best tags we also have talks

00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:45,309
organized by speakers so you can find

00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:49,660
everything that somebody has said on a

00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:51,939
particular in their career we also have

00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,649
event the talks organized by events so

00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:55,779
if you want to look at do the talks from

00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:58,929
this event you can find them when they

00:11:55,779 --> 00:12:01,269
get posted we are also an open source

00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:03,369
project so if you would like to help you

00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:05,980
can go to that URL and you can start

00:12:03,369 --> 00:12:09,999
seeing which videos we have not yet

00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:12,759
posted we are based on Pelican which is

00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:15,009
a python-based static site generator the

00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:18,999
video entries are JSON objects and we

00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:20,439
are relatively beginner friendly there

00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:21,939
are a couple things that I would like to

00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:23,769
sort out that would make it even more of

00:12:21,939 --> 00:12:25,149
a beginner friendly but if you are

00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:27,509
interested in getting involved in open

00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:29,470
source we are a very good first project

00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:32,859
unfortunately we will not be sprinting

00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:36,039
but this is a good place to start so I

00:12:32,859 --> 00:12:38,339
guess visit Pi video org and enjoy our

00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:38,339
videos

00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:50,570
to start out read a passcode thank you

00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:53,090
so hello Django Kahn this is fun with

00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:59,180
channels my name is Jeremy gaytan's I'm

00:12:53,090 --> 00:13:00,590
here from Philadelphia this presentation

00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:03,140
is going to be a mix about Django

00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:05,510
channels and also about Pablo Picasso

00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:08,120
so as an intro alright is a lie that

00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:15,950
makes us realize the truth and this

00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:18,350
piece is woman in a hat okay as for me I

00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:19,880
am I only have five minutes but I can

00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:22,430
talk all day about myself I am the

00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:26,080
newest web professional at words the

00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:29,570
award-winning research platform of

00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:32,180
Wharton Business School I graduated from

00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:34,760
Eton College I'm a Tom Petty fan who

00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,370
does web design in that order often

00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,100
referred to as a degenerate disc golfer

00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:41,780
much of my free time I'm spending

00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:44,270
chasing that sweet jangle jangle at the

00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:45,740
world famous said ugly woods disc golf

00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:52,100
course if you have any questions about

00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:54,890
this golf please come find me okay the

00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,840
point of all this why are we here learn

00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:59,360
the rules like a pro so you can break

00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:02,870
them like an artist and this is girl

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,630
before mirror there we go

00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,370
so what the talk is on is Django

00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:09,440
channels I wanted to learn a little bit

00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:11,450
about it at Django con because I was

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,220
unfamiliar with it and the best way to

00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:18,860
learn about a subject

00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:21,080
it's a present about it yeah so channels

00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:24,050
are something that it allows for more

00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:27,560
than playing HTTP requests I find that

00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:29,750
it allows you to really have a fully

00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,120
functioning website that both the front

00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:36,860
end and the back end are completely

00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:39,980
synchronized the proof of this good

00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:42,890
artists borrow great artists steal as we

00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:46,060
all know hi there as an open source

00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:51,610
there's no use reinventing the wheel

00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:51,610
this is piece of Picasso is Doraemon

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:58,040
and what I found what the with Django

00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:00,080
channels what I found the value in it is

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,830
as a web designer who'd like to do

00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:07,790
projects on the side I'm able to offer

00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:09,620
added functionality to my clients which

00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:12,410
is really great like the one thing the

00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,850
one use case that I've found is offering

00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:15,410
a chat for their website

00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,390
so if you're thinking of e-commerce

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:19,430
website a lot of times people will put

00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:21,530
something in their cart but by having

00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:23,690
this chat functionality and I'm kind of

00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:27,230
getting a head of myself you'll be able

00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:30,770
to you'll be able to finalize more

00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:32,870
purchases or at least that's the goal so

00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:38,630
the purpose action is the foundational

00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:42,980
key to all success this is this is Dora

00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:44,840
Maar the Picasso piece thank you so I

00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,940
wanted to build something we're here

00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,820
we're doing Kohl code we're all doing

00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:50,870
fun stuff I wanted to make a

00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:53,840
rock-paper-scissors game using Django

00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:55,910
using Django channels and for for those

00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,940
who are not familiar rock-paper-scissors

00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:00,380
is a hand game in which each player

00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:03,110
simultaneous forms one of the three

00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:07,400
shapes with an outstretched hand paper

00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:12,920
covers rock rock breaks scissors and so

00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:16,400
on and so forth okay so this is what I

00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:19,400
made here this is part of it and as you

00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,350
can see it has the logic and it tells

00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,420
you right now okay hey gives you the

00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:25,130
score at the bottom I apologize for all

00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,340
the design I've literally was coding

00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:31,520
this five minutes ago sure my bosses

00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:33,890
love to hear that moving on so yeah as

00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:36,110
you can see even with the simple design

00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:38,660
hey I threw a rock ponent threw a rock

00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:45,100
tie so on and so forth

00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:50,020
oh hey do you want to play again no good

00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:50,020
when stuff doesn't work okay

00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:58,119
conclusion only put off until tomorrow

00:16:55,809 --> 00:17:00,759
what you are willing to die having left

00:16:58,119 --> 00:17:03,459
undone of course this is Picasso's most

00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:07,839
one of his most famous pieces the three

00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:13,870
musicians and finally a live demo okay

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:17,020
cuz what could go wrong okay this is a

00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:27,850
Heroku app that I came up with following

00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:29,740
the tutorial you put in my name okay but

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:32,909
simultaneously if you went through this

00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,909
awesome this chair

00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:52,860
how much sound I got actually okay well

00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,860
everybody wants to see how the game

00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:02,460
that's true you gotta go you gots to go

00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:11,700
that's all why thank you very much

00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:14,019
everybody take care and have a great day

00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,649
obviously this is supposed to be a

00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:17,230
little bit of a light-hearted

00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:18,279
introduction into cryptocurrency of how

00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:20,769
to lose all your money trading

00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:22,119
cryptocurrency the first way to do that

00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:26,889
is to take advice from a five-minute

00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:28,690
presentation at a conference the second

00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:31,929
way is to listen to somebody that's only

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:33,820
been doing it for five months and then

00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:35,139
the obligatory this is not financial

00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:39,639
advice so if you lose all your money

00:18:35,139 --> 00:18:40,960
it's not my fault so the first place we

00:18:39,639 --> 00:18:42,730
need to start is with Bitcoin this is

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,919
kind of an introduction into crypto

00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,269
currencies if you've never taken a look

00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:47,889
at it before but you've always been like

00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:49,480
someday I need to figure out the basics

00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:51,190
of that the first thing is you don't

00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,080
need to understand the technology to

00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,529
actually be able to deal with Bitcoin

00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,730
and other altcoins

00:18:55,529 --> 00:19:00,789
basically it starts out you have a coin

00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:03,399
and it really is just a piece of numbers

00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:05,679
on a long really long string on a

00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:07,539
blockchain the blockchain is basically a

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,009
distributed database and that's all you

00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:10,629
need to understand for the moment until

00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:15,309
you get further and deeper into like

00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:18,159
researching other topics this wallet

00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:21,639
address at the top actually produces

00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:23,200
this a QR code that people use with

00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:24,669
their wallets and I'll explain that or

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,529
their wallet applications which I'll

00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:27,820
explain here in a second and by the way

00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:29,289
if you currently have something you

00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:32,549
could send me a tip using this QR code

00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:35,590
and I would appreciate it I would so

00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:37,809
there is kind of three types of wallets

00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:40,720
that you can generally think of there's

00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:42,580
a hardware wallets there's a hot wallet

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,049
and then there's a paper wallet

00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,269
hardware wallets is actually kind of

00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:48,129
like a USB stick that you kind of plug

00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:50,320
into your computer it pops up you can

00:19:48,129 --> 00:19:51,669
actually do all your things there's a

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,730
hot wallet which is something like

00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:57,470
Jack's jhj a XX which is

00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:59,950
what I use for my day-to-day

00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:03,310
interactions over the Internet

00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:05,150
but it's not actually stored on my the

00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:08,450
information isn't is stored on my

00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:10,520
machine on a node probably shouldn't go

00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,050
much further into those details and

00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,970
there's a paper wallet which is actually

00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:15,110
really fascinating to me you basically

00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:16,250
write down a whole bunch of stuff on a

00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:18,020
piece of paper put it in your safe

00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,730
deposit box and the only way anyone can

00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,500
ever access that wallet so they go to

00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,760
your paper there your safe deposit box

00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,450
pull out that paper and type in those

00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,950
numbers into a specific piece of

00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:29,570
technology and then basically all the

00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,710
while it is at the end of the day that

00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:33,170
you need to understand it is a whole

00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:36,860
bunch of words kind of like you know

00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:39,020
many word password that you need to save

00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,630
somewhere so that you can restore that

00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:44,210
wallet and at a later later time

00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:45,380
basically all wallets are is a long

00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:48,470
string that I showed you in the

00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:51,590
beginning that save basically one twos

00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:54,080
and threes and either you know 123

00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:56,030
bitcoins or point 0 1 2 3 bitcoins

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,660
however you want to deal with it

00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:01,670
it's just string the stores numbers so

00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,170
how do you get some Bitcoin the easiest

00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:05,090
place that I find for people to start is

00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:07,040
to use a site called coin base you can

00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,870
basically attach either a credit card a

00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:12,320
PayPal account or your checking account

00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:15,080
and you can immediately ish buy some

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:18,050
bitcoins and it gets started on your

00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,670
path from there you can actually move

00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:21,710
through wallet you through your

00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:23,780
different wallets a Bitcoin from one

00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:27,110
location to another by using that

00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:30,260
address so that leads us to alt coins

00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:31,820
all coins are in a sense derivatives a

00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,410
Bitcoin that's how they kind of started

00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,840
and then other people started developing

00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:37,760
similar blockchain technologies and they

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,680
to have a wallet similar to that long

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,050
string that holds one twos and threes

00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,840
and whatever combination that you need

00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:46,610
and you can to trade those back and

00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,930
forth those are basically all coins it's

00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,760
some sort of value that other people

00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:51,920
place on another type of technology

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,050
where can you get some all coins you can

00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,490
get to other types that coinbase again I

00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:57,080
like to bring up coin base because it's

00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:59,630
an easy place to start you can get

00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:03,200
aetherium and litecoin and they're

00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:04,880
debating the new Bitcoin cash at some

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,500
other point to maybe bring that on board

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,700
so that kind of gives you a place to

00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,950
start

00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,840
but there's 800 different altcoins how

00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,310
do you get those well you can go a step

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,880
further and you can go with shape-shift

00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:20,000
and you can start shifting from one

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:23,000
altcoin to another through there it'll I

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,740
forget how many it's like 30 or 50 or

00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,840
something like that to start but where

00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,940
do you get the other 800 potentials you

00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:32,420
start with exchanges plenty X bit tricks

00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,980
Kraken orgy docks or your top ways to

00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:36,740
exchange it and this is how you make

00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:39,080
your money doing day trading a lot of

00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:41,060
information out there about that so

00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:44,150
let's get to more ways to lose money

00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:47,240
randomly by alt coins without doing any

00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:49,280
research buy and sell any motion don't

00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,170
buy and sell any motion I can explain

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,810
that one to you later don't learn

00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:56,600
anything about trading and don't pay

00:22:53,810 --> 00:23:01,490
attention to the market finally don't

00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:02,630
start and then I'm run go Jango I'm on

00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,310
buddy Lindsey on Twitter and don't

00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:07,720
forget you can send me a bitcoin tip if

00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:07,720
you want thank you and have a good day

00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:12,200
okay so we'll see if we can make this

00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:15,380
work

00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:18,230
alright so hi I'm Nicole James my

00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:21,980
twitter handle is at Oppo chick

00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:24,260
underscore and I several people have

00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:26,510
asked me why I use a bow chick it's

00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:30,110
because I am a professional amateur

00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:31,910
oboist so I figured I'd go through and

00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:33,770
because I need practice speaking in

00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:40,330
front of people give you a small history

00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:44,450
about the oboe so the first like when

00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:48,350
the first sort of oboe is actually the

00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:51,970
Olos I'm hope I don't butcher this it's

00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:54,760
a flute that was done used in Greece and

00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:57,740
[Music]

00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:00,530
it they believed that it had a double

00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:04,700
reed which is what the oboe is it's a

00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:12,020
double reed instrument so the Olos is

00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:16,400
either one or two cylindrical tubes that

00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:20,410
you blow into and you play it's a

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,410
there's a fun myth about how

00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:27,220
Apolo cursed midas with donkey ears

00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:29,950
because there was a competition and

00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:32,590
midas declared that apollo did not play

00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:34,890
better than the person competing against

00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:39,370
him so that was fun

00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:43,660
but the next one that i could find was

00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:48,220
the do duke this is from our mania there

00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:50,620
are many different opinions about when

00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:53,440
this one actually originates timewise

00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:57,610
but the armenian historian say around

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,650
1200 bc if you notice it has the double

00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:03,310
reed at the very tip of it it's a rather

00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:05,980
large reed and it sounds closer to an

00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:08,710
english horn which is kind of like the

00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:11,500
tenor oboe so it's kind of it's a lower

00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:14,440
voice it's still used today

00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:16,600
it's normally played with two dukes one

00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,580
of them plays kind of a drone or one

00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,080
tone and the other one plays a melody on

00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:22,090
top of it and you get a really

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:27,360
interesting thing it kind of sounds like

00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:30,490
the bagpipes but not so that's a Duke

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:33,250
then there's the zurna or the sorna

00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:37,000
depending on where in the Middle East

00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:38,370
you are it there's a it shows up all

00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,590
over the Middle East

00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:48,160
there's stone tablets with Persian

00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:52,150
courtesans playing the siRNA so that's a

00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:56,170
lot of fun it is normally about this

00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:58,690
long which is not very long if you know

00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:01,120
most instruments it's pretty short again

00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:03,070
it is the double reed and the reed is

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:07,000
about half the length of the modern

00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:13,200
oboes reed so it's about the size of the

00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:17,710
tip of your thumb but again and then

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:21,100
most oboes and renditions that come

00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:26,440
after this are actually derived from the

00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:29,170
zurna so there's the Sunna which is the

00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,270
Chinese version they believe that the

00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:33,940
oldest record that they have of the SONA

00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:37,419
is from the Jade

00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:39,340
dynasty there you're pretty sure that it

00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:41,200
showed up before then but they're also

00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:43,809
pretty sure that it didn't originate in

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,059
China so they're pretty sure that it was

00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:50,730
probably one of those things where like

00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:56,649
the zurna or the sorna showed up and

00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:58,840
this was created after that they sona is

00:26:56,649 --> 00:27:01,960
still used in China it's used for

00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:04,090
funerals marriages and some military

00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,799
well in ancient history it was used for

00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:08,740
military maneuvers similar to the way

00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:10,269
the Scots used the bagpipes kind of to

00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:12,730
give the signal because it's really

00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:16,659
really really loud it's not something

00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:18,100
you want to play inside and it's really

00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:21,519
fun when you get one that's made out of

00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:24,399
all brass instead of wood and brass so

00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:26,559
that's fun this one I just mentioned I

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,120
wasn't I don't have a chance to go into

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,389
all of the ones in Africa there's about

00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:32,529
five different ones in Africa as well

00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:34,779
but I just thought I'd mention they're

00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:37,210
there too we're gonna move into Europe

00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:41,519
now this one is the direct descendant of

00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:46,240
the Xena the sharm it's in Europe

00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:47,889
they're around 1600 they started adding

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,289
all different sizes so that you can have

00:27:47,889 --> 00:27:53,830
an entire course so there's a soprano to

00:27:50,289 --> 00:27:57,009
the base all of them which then led to

00:27:53,830 --> 00:28:01,720
the original oboe which had seven holes

00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:04,059
and two keys on it and then we got to

00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,679
the modern oboe which has about 15

00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:08,679
different holes in it and this is the

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:11,259
one that I play so to see either three

00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:15,009
of them together and after that there

00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:16,480
are now like ten of them but they're not

00:28:15,009 --> 00:28:19,149
used very often there's one of them

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,679
where there's only two pieces that have

00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:22,149
ever been written for the instrument and

00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:25,590
there's only about three of them in the

00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:25,590
entire world so

00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:39,120
or OD so has just been said we having a

00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:40,740
solar eclipse here in on the 21st which

00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,009
I didn't know until after I'd already

00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:45,779
who's going to come to Django con and I

00:28:44,009 --> 00:28:47,899
thought well gee it's some a few days

00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:51,269
after and we're almost going to be there

00:28:47,899 --> 00:28:53,250
and like this eclipse which was in 2002

00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:56,820
we went a long way to go see that

00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:58,500
eclipse for 30 seconds of totality but

00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:01,019
it was something that I will remember

00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:03,480
for the rest of my life so so this is a

00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:06,570
bit of a warm-up for for next week so

00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,580
this is a this is near where we totality

00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:11,129
happened which is in the South

00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:13,559
Australian desert which is a very barren

00:29:11,129 --> 00:29:15,809
place as you can see from the photo

00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:18,210
there and if it wasn't for the Eclipse

00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:21,000
there'd be no one there they'd have like

00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:22,860
say a big a big ranch with say five

00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,990
people on it and it could be a hundred

00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:26,340
miles across or 200 miles across and

00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:29,159
that's that's the only thing that's

00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:31,409
there which means that when you are

00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:32,490
selecting a site to get it to some view

00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:35,309
this Eclipse you need to be really

00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:37,080
careful getting the car off the road

00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:38,879
so here's some friends that came up from

00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,100
Adelaide and we had to dig the car out

00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:45,240
of this big ditch that they managed to

00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:46,649
ground the car on so that was theirs we

00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,210
had a bit of spare time before because

00:29:46,649 --> 00:29:50,129
the Eclipse ain't gonna wait just like

00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:52,889
five-minute lightning talk finishes at

00:29:50,129 --> 00:29:57,750
five minutes sharp totality happens and

00:29:52,889 --> 00:30:00,600
then it goes and so so there's the boys

00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:03,659
with their various homemade instruments

00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,919
looking at the eclipse before totality

00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:07,350
you can't look at it through the naked

00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:09,899
eye when you look at the Sun where it's

00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:12,330
just up in the sky by itself it will

00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:15,240
cause you pain and you'll look away but

00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:17,399
when it's close to totality it won't

00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,120
cause you pain but the damage is still

00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:23,159
happening

00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:25,970
so you need to be very careful but when

00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:30,240
it's total you can look at it directly

00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:32,100
but only when it's total so here's some

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,570
boys looking at some reflections in

00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,669
these devices that they're made up which

00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:37,769
because it was late in the day which

00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:39,960
next week won't be they could

00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:42,179
conveniently lose use the slope of the

00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:46,590
car our windscreen

00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:48,299
to put those devices on the interesting

00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:50,009
things this photos blurry take at this

00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:53,940
of 2002 and digital cameras weren't any

00:30:50,009 --> 00:30:56,279
new near as good back then the light was

00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,629
still looked bright but it actually

00:30:56,279 --> 00:31:00,779
wasn't bright it was actually really

00:30:57,629 --> 00:31:03,450
dark the Sun was about 95 percent

00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:05,249
covered by this stage and we're just

00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:07,590
looking at the shutter times on cameras

00:31:05,249 --> 00:31:12,509
and they're really long even though it

00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:18,029
looked bright but it wasn't

00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:20,690
finally it starts to get dark I took

00:31:18,029 --> 00:31:23,460
some pictures with a with a film camera

00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:27,090
which have been scanned and here's a

00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:29,340
photo of the Sun with the filter and so

00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:32,610
I'll just quickly flick you through as

00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:35,369
the moon begins to appear which is about

00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:38,850
an hour and a half before totality and

00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:43,110
it spends its time cruising over the

00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:44,460
sun's face slowly when it's looking like

00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,409
that you look up in the sky when it's

00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:48,899
like this if you actually weren't

00:31:46,409 --> 00:31:50,369
looking at it through a filter it

00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:55,139
doesn't really look different to normal

00:31:50,369 --> 00:31:57,119
daytime and the Sun even just five

00:31:55,139 --> 00:31:59,220
percent cover it at five percent less so

00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:59,940
95 percent coverage it's still just

00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,119
looks normal

00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:06,600
it's only when you see that moon is

00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:11,129
slowly but surely covering more and more

00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:12,809
now we get this very thin Crescent it

00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:14,909
still looks like daytime but now it's

00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:19,080
getting really dark

00:32:14,909 --> 00:32:20,580
I had a big filter over the camera when

00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,159
I'm looking at this tiny Crescent I was

00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:26,279
like maybe I can take that filter off

00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:27,960
and so that then I take the filter off

00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:34,730
and this has taken unfiltered and it's

00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:34,730
like blasting away and then I see that

00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:39,809
which is the last direct sunlight fading

00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,730
and we can start to see the chronosphere

00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:43,889
of the Sun which is the red thing and

00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:45,480
because I only had 30 seconds I had

00:32:43,889 --> 00:32:47,639
whole plan for what I was going to do in

00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:50,249
terms of photo exposures and go bang

00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:51,690
bang bang bang bang like this guy coming

00:32:50,249 --> 00:32:54,809
up to me like 30 seconds there's a

00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:57,240
better time from there to here and so we

00:32:54,809 --> 00:33:00,980
see the Bailey beads we see the the

00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:07,740
beginning of the solar chronosphere

00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:10,230
and then it's gone then the end the

00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:12,059
start of the Sun from the other side and

00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:26,159
that's the solar eclipse you'll never

00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:29,850
forget them my name's prefetching behind

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:32,730
the scenes so how many people here have

00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:37,109
used or at least heard of prefetch

00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:38,940
related within jenga so quite a few but

00:33:37,109 --> 00:33:41,309
probably not everyone has taken a look

00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:43,679
at what the code is that Django is doing

00:33:41,309 --> 00:33:44,220
under the hood in order to make this

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,570
work

00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:50,249
I found a number of times that it's been

00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:53,490
useful to know what's going on

00:33:50,249 --> 00:33:55,590
and so I wanted to give an overview

00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:57,659
today of just sort of kind of the main

00:33:55,590 --> 00:34:00,269
functions involved and the main pieces

00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:02,070
so that if you may need to customize how

00:34:00,269 --> 00:34:06,179
you fetch data you'll sort of know

00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:09,990
what's going on so we'll have a little

00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:12,750
toy example today with dogs and toys you

00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:14,669
have two simple Django models and the

00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:17,339
thing to notice is that on the toy

00:34:14,669 --> 00:34:19,770
there's a foreign key to the dog model

00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:24,869
and so we'll think of the toys as toys

00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:28,740
belonging to a dog so what happens when

00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:30,899
django evaluates this query said well

00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:32,520
the first thing that happens is it

00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:36,030
evaluates it as if you hadn't done

00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:37,669
prefetch related at all so it's just

00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:41,010
like the same thing when you evaluate

00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:42,389
Django objects at all Django we'll run

00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:45,419
some sequel

00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:48,389
and build a list of dogs so here we have

00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:53,819
me okie and Megatron which are my two

00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:57,569
little chihuahuas and so once it has a

00:34:53,819 --> 00:35:00,839
list of dogs then it needs to perform

00:34:57,569 --> 00:35:03,720
the prefetching so the main function

00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:05,940
that does all of this and Django is this

00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,140
prefetch related objects function it

00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:10,380
lives under

00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:12,210
Chango DB models query that's sort of

00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:14,549
where all of the prefetching code lives

00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:16,970
and what happens is django calls that

00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:20,339
function it passes in the list of dogs

00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:23,819
that we got from before as well as our

00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:26,910
prefetch related lookups so the first

00:35:23,819 --> 00:35:29,819
thing that prefetch related objects has

00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:33,450
to do is it needs to find a prefetcher

00:35:29,819 --> 00:35:36,779
and a prefetcher is just any object that

00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:39,900
has a get prefetch query set method so

00:35:36,779 --> 00:35:42,029
django has a number of built-in classes

00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:44,730
that have these methods but you know you

00:35:42,029 --> 00:35:46,440
could very well make your own just any

00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:49,680
sort of object that has get prefetch

00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,779
query set the code that gets the

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,029
prefetcher is this get prefetcher

00:35:51,779 --> 00:35:56,160
function and at the end of the day in

00:35:54,029 --> 00:35:59,549
our example basically all it will end up

00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:01,230
doing is it will take the first dog in

00:35:59,549 --> 00:36:04,140
our list of dogs and get the toys

00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:07,500
attribute here we can see it's a related

00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:09,539
manager and that this related manager

00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:13,289
does indeed have a get prefetch query

00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:17,250
set method so once it has this

00:36:13,289 --> 00:36:19,440
prefetcher we need to use it so the

00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:24,029
function that does this is pre fetch one

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:27,119
level and we call the get prefetch query

00:36:24,029 --> 00:36:30,000
month get prefetch query set method we

00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:32,789
pass in our list of dogs and we get back

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,319
five objects so if you want to implement

00:36:32,789 --> 00:36:37,200
one of these things you just have to

00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:38,609
return these five objects I'll briefly

00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,490
go over what they are there's this

00:36:38,609 --> 00:36:45,390
related query set which is here it's all

00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:48,450
our toys filtered by the dog IDs but you

00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:50,039
could return any sort of iterable for

00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:52,799
that and Django doesn't really care that

00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:54,720
it's a query set we have related object

00:36:52,799 --> 00:36:57,660
adder which takes one of these toys and

00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:01,500
returns an identifier for which dog gets

00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:05,069
associated to instance adder takes a dog

00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:07,769
and also returns an identifier and

00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:10,829
that's how it matches them up is single

00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:13,289
means there can be it's false so there

00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:15,930
could be more than one toy per dog and a

00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:18,599
cash name for where to store it so once

00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:19,610
we have this we can iterate over all of

00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:22,730
our

00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:25,490
the query set will get our list of toys

00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:27,250
we can use this related object adder

00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:30,410
function to build a list of toy object

00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:33,260
dictionary mapping the identifier to the

00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:35,630
toys and then we can iterate over our

00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:37,610
dogs and associate the toys with them so

00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:40,640
here if you look on Miyake there's a

00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:42,470
prefetched objects cache and that's a

00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,480
mapping with the between this cache name

00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:47,480
and here we have a query set with the

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,730
toys already on there and you can see if

00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:51,500
you do me okidata toys at all you're

00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:57,860
actually getting this object from the

00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:59,750
cache and so thanks if you're interested

00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:02,210
in like efficient data fetching in

00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:03,170
Django or pretty much anything else feel

00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:05,840
free to come see me

00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:08,630
also Rover is hiring so check out our

00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:18,830
careers page and also our engineering

00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:20,480
blog alright my name is Kenneth writes

00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:23,000
if you know who I am it's probably from

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,410
the request project which I created and

00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,880
I'm here to talk to you about a new

00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:28,730
project of mine called Pippins

00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:30,950
which is intended to replace your usage

00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:33,620
of Pip and virtual have on a day to day

00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:35,360
basis so one of the problems with Pip in

00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:38,870
virtual labs when you're using them is

00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:42,320
that there's two ways to use Pip with

00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:46,940
requirements files one of them if this

00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:48,860
takes large enough to see it is good is

00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:50,780
to specify the requirements in a very

00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:53,450
human friendly format like this where

00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:56,120
you just specify the names of the

00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:57,560
dependencies that you want unfortunately

00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:00,200
when you go to push to production this

00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:04,460
is not a very stable build so the more

00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:07,190
best practice way to do it is to pin all

00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:09,620
of your dependencies like this and this

00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:12,410
is called dependency pending effectively

00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:13,820
so there are ways to do both of these at

00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:17,720
the same time there's some great tools

00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:19,100
available for that like pip tools and I

00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:22,340
recommend using those tools if you're

00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:23,810
using pip and but I wrote a tool called

00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:25,490
pip M which I'll show you right now

00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:28,070
which kind of gives you the best of both

00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:30,050
worlds so I'm going to CD or make it a

00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:32,720
directory called demo so it's going to

00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:36,109
be a brand new project

00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:39,619
and I'm gonna do Pippins and I'm gonna

00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:41,210
install Django and it's gonna create a

00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:42,740
pip file for the project and it's gonna

00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:44,000
create a virtual em for the project for

00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:46,250
me because it knows that that's what I

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,760
want to do and it'll take a second for

00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:51,560
it to go and install Django because the

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,349
internet connection is not incredibly

00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:56,740
fast let me connect my iPad it'll speed

00:39:54,349 --> 00:39:56,740
things up

00:39:57,849 --> 00:40:07,060
hopefully there yeah there we go

00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:16,430
come on there we go installing Django

00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:18,290
excellent so what this is doing is it's

00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:19,819
creating a new file called a pip file

00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:22,099
which is gonna be something that's built

00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:23,480
into pip in the future and it's a new

00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:25,970
standard for specifying your

00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:29,030
dependencies so now if we look at the

00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:31,910
PIP file it's in this nice human

00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:33,800
friendly format tamil and you see Django

00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:35,930
equal star which means I didn't specify

00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,000
a version of Django so I'm saying it can

00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:40,670
use any version of Django and I can do

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,020
pip end block which takes a few seconds

00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:45,589
because of the way pip works I

00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:47,450
unfortunately can't say tell me go get

00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:48,109
tell me the latest version of Django it

00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:54,170
has to download

00:40:48,109 --> 00:40:56,089
again we can do pip file dot lock and

00:40:54,170 --> 00:41:01,420
just like in bundler and all those other

00:40:56,089 --> 00:41:04,460
tools now we have it generates a

00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:06,230
deterministic file that you can use to

00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:12,140
rebuild your environment so Django

00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:15,410
requires version 1.1 1.4 and PI TZ @

00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:16,849
2017 dot 2 and so it did that all for us

00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:18,859
and we didn't have to deal with that so

00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:20,150
if you can just start your project and

00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:21,680
do pip and install it would have

00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:23,869
installed the right version if you had a

00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,880
lock file in there and everything works

00:41:23,869 --> 00:41:28,190
great and the cool thing about this is

00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,540
like in I'm using the default version of

00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:32,810
Python right now let's say I want to

00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:35,300
switch to Python 3 I just do Pippin - -

00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:37,490
3 and it will destroy my virtual lab and

00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:41,150
create it with Python 3 and if I want to

00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:44,630
switch to - I do pipe if and - - - and

00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:45,980
it does the same thing so it's managing

00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,430
and destroying my virtual ends for me

00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,809
it's

00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:49,940
kind of like a replacement for virtual

00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:51,859
and rapper and pip and all those things

00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:54,710
combined by using and utilizing all

00:41:51,859 --> 00:41:57,410
those tools together so yeah do we have

00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:59,920
do we have time for like a question is

00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:04,609
that a thing that might even talk to you

00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:06,920
in 15 seconds left the hashes of the the

00:42:04,609 --> 00:42:09,440
PIP file so that we know when it's out

00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:12,849
of date so if you update the pic file it

00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,849
knows when the lock file is out of date

00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:22,940
yep hip and block - hashes will include

00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:25,880
hashes for all of the packages and we'll

00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:27,470
check them when you install yes that's

00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,210
disabled by default because different

00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:32,359
versions of Python will download

00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:35,119
different packages and and will have

00:42:32,359 --> 00:42:39,710
different hashes it was they used to be

00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:43,250
on by default yes pip install pip ends

00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:47,240
here you can find out about it at pit

00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:59,569
bemberg yes works great with Windows

00:42:47,240 --> 00:43:03,770
that was not easy by what yes you can in

00:42:59,569 --> 00:43:06,500
your pip files say there there's a pep

00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:08,720
for this tits pep 5:38 I believe in that

00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,460
you can specify any other version

00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,890
markers and one of them is it requires

00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:14,599
Python and then you can run you can

00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:17,720
specify any version of Python in there

00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:20,690
and then you can run tip them check and

00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:30,220
it will check all of those requirements

00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:30,220
