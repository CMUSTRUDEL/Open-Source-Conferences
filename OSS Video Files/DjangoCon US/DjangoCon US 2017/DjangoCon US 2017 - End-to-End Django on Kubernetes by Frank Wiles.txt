	DjangoCon US 2017 - End-to-End Django on Kubernetes by Frank Wiles

Not only is Kubernetes a great way to deploy Django and all of its dependencies, itâ€™s actually the easiest way! Really!

Deploying multi-layer applications with multiple dependencies is exactly what Kubernetes is designed to do. You can replace pages of Django and PostgreSQL configuration templates with a simple Kubernetes config, OpenShift template or Helm chart, and then stand up the entire stack for your application in a single command. In this presentation, we will walk you through the setup required to deploy and scale Django, including:

Replicated PostgreSQL with persistent storage and automated failover
Scalable Django application servers
Front-ends and DNS routing

The templates covered in this presentation should be applicable to developing your own Kubernetes deployments, and the concepts will apply to anyone looking at any container orchestration platform.
