	DjangoCon US 2017 - Autopsy of a slow train wreck: The life and death of a Django startup by Russell Keith-Magee

Everyone knows the story: armed with nothing more than a laptop and a dream, a couple of plucky geeks decide to take on the world: disrupting, innovating, and subverting their way to success. In just a few short months, they take a ramshackle collection of software and turn it into a money-printing factory that enables them to drive off into the sunset in gold-plated Lamborghinis.

But it isnâ€™t always like that. In fact, it usually isnâ€™t. Venture Capitalists (VCâ€™s) make their investments betting that 15 out of 20 businesses they invest in will outright fail, 4 will maybe get a payoff, and 1 will be a massive success. We always hear about the 1 - the Facebooks, the Instagrams, the WhatsApps. But we very rarely hear about the 15 that donâ€™t succeed. And thatâ€™s only counting the VC-funded companies - there are many other companies that never make it past hobby stage, or live a short, privately funded life on the back of consulting income before being quietly shut down.

This is a case study of one such a failure - TradesCloud. What went right? What went wrong? And what you can learn from TradesCloudâ€™s mistakes if youâ€™re contemplating starting a business of your own?
