	DjangoCon US 2017 - Autopsy of a slow train wreck: The life and death of a Django startup by Russell Keith-Magee

Everyone knows the story: armed with nothing more than a laptop and a dream, a couple of plucky geeks decide to take on the world: disrupting, innovating, and subverting their way to success. In just a few short months, they take a ramshackle collection of software and turn it into a money-printing factory that enables them to drive off into the sunset in gold-plated Lamborghinis.

But it isnâ€™t always like that. In fact, it usually isnâ€™t. Venture Capitalists (VCâ€™s) make their investments betting that 15 out of 20 businesses they invest in will outright fail, 4 will maybe get a payoff, and 1 will be a massive success. We always hear about the 1 - the Facebooks, the Instagrams, the WhatsApps. But we very rarely hear about the 15 that donâ€™t succeed. And thatâ€™s only counting the VC-funded companies - there are many other companies that never make it past hobby stage, or live a short, privately funded life on the back of consulting income before being quietly shut down.

This is a case study of one such a failure - TradesCloud. What went right? What went wrong? And what you can learn from TradesCloudâ€™s mistakes if youâ€™re contemplating starting a business of your own?

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,520
yes my name is Russell Keith McGee

00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,200
you've probably heard my name before I

00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,240
am an almost 12 year veteran of the

00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,700
Django core team I was president of the

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,390
Django software foundation from 2011 to

00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:29,860
2015 and as she said along with Andrew

00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,599
Godwin I hold the title of most Django

00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,390
concert ended and having attended every

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,399
check on us and if you'd met me at one

00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,320
of those Django Khan's in the last six

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,149
years or insignia speak generally I

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,520
probably would have introduced myself as

00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:45,400
the CTO and co-founder of trades cloud

00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,320
trades cloud was a software as a service

00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,350
company for trades people plumbers

00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,300
electricians carpenters people like that

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,480
trades cloud was my startup and I say

00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,950
was because in January of this year my

00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,420
business partner and I closed the doors

00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:02,410
on trades cloud which shut down the

00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:04,449
service as an industry we're really fond

00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:06,490
of promoting the glossy side of startups

00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:08,170
that our plucky bunch of engineers can

00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,850
take an idea and a personal credit card

00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,500
and build an entire business empire

00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,650
drive off to the sunset and gold-plated

00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,000
Lamborghinis and yes those like those

00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:18,249
new corns and the gold-plated

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,719
Lamborghinis actually do exist there's

00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:21,579
even a couple of them in the Django

00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:24,579
community the unicorn stop the gold

00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:25,810
plated design begins but it's important

00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:28,299
to remember that these stories are

00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,670
unicorns they're not the normal start of

00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:33,429
experience for most people in the

00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:36,369
vc-backed startup world the general

00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:38,380
expectation is if the VC firm invests in

00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:41,170
20 companies only one of them will

00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:43,179
actually succeed spectacularly four will

00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,609
have some sort of exit that at least

00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:48,609
results in a break-even financially but

00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:50,939
15 they expect 15 to fail outright with

00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:52,929
a significant or complete financial loss

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,240
interestingly this isn't something

00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:57,249
that's unique to tech tech does it at a

00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,380
much grander scale especially when VCS

00:01:57,249 --> 00:02:01,329
are involved but open any small business

00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,469
advice book the sort that is targeted at

00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,600
the plumbers and electricians of the

00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:06,609
world and they'll warn you that 50% of

00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,610
businesses fail in their first year and

00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:12,340
yet despite the fact this failure

00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:14,740
happens all the time we don't talk about

00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:17,500
it we don't talk about why things phone

00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,450
and as a result many of the same lessons

00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,570
end up having to be learned over and

00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:24,190
over again though those that experience

00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,760
failure often feel like they're doing it

00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,650
alone

00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,170
because of the significant social

00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:31,689
stigma that's associated with failure so

00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:33,189
this is my small attempt to restore that

00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:35,319
balance in his talk I'm going to talk

00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:38,500
about trades clout my failed business

00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:40,450
trades cloud was a slow train wreck we

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,459
survived for six years almost to the day

00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,680
and we had plenty of optimism that

00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:47,560
success was just around the corner but

00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,090
that never quite happened but what was

00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,310
trades clam what prompted me to dedicate

00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:53,319
six years of my life to it well it

00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,329
started as a problem that I thought I

00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:58,030
could solve if you find yourself needing

00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:59,650
a plumber how do you pick one well 15

00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,569
years ago when I first had the idea for

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,950
what became trades cloud the best option

00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:04,480
was opening a phone book and looking for

00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,519
the brightest shiniest add maybe

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,310
arranging a couple of quotes picking one

00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,540
basically at random if you were really

00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,250
lucky you might have been able to use

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,959
Google more likely in the US and in

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,060
Australia but you were still looking for

00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:17,739
what was basically the shiniest ad if

00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,599
they turned out to be good well that's

00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,370
great but you probably won't need

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,950
another plumber for a while so that

00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,720
knowledge is almost useless and if they

00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,090
turn out to be awful well you can't warn

00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,430
anyone off either there has to be a

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,910
better way and of course I did nothing

00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,400
about it

00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,709
I say nothing I did start tinkering

00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,569
around with this web framework may have

00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:39,669
heard of it it's called Django I

00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:40,930
originally got involved in the Django

00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:43,419
project because I wanted to add

00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,980
aggregation functions to the ORM so that

00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:51,010
I could compute average ratings of

00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:52,930
plumbers and in 2008 I mentored a

00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,849
student nicolas lara to adit who added

00:03:52,930 --> 00:04:01,090
aggregation as a Summer of Code project

00:03:54,849 --> 00:04:03,099
so success then in late 2010 I met up

00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,720
with a former boss for a drink and he

00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:06,940
told me about his brother his brother

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,519
owns a pest control company in Australia

00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:11,739
in Perth and he had the same problem but

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,540
from a different angle I'm looking for

00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:16,000
trades people in my area that can be

00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,859
recommended he is a small a pest control

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,169
company that wants to compete with the

00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:21,639
big players with the shiny ads based

00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:24,400
upon the quality of the service that he

00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:26,770
could provide and so trades cloud was

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,060
born we had an idea at the time it

00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,380
actually wasn't even called trades cloud

00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,530
it was called clever pages because it

00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,630
was going to be a clever Yellow Pages

00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:37,390
any my spare time we started hacking

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:39,700
together a proof-of-concept that was my

00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:42,250
first mistake and the first mistake that

00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,840
most tech oriented people make as much

00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,940
as Django sells itself as a rapid

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,220
development framework and it is any

00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,320
non-trivial project still takes up time

00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,510
and effort and I spend a couple of

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,910
months of spare time hacking together a

00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,170
proof-of-concept

00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,850
German military strategists Helmuth von

00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,380
Moltke a--what's noted that no battle

00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:02,020
plan survives first contact with the

00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,880
enemy or in non-military terms Scottish

00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,220
poet Ravi burns the best-laid schemes of

00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,200
mice and men gang after glai and so it

00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,550
is with business ideas all the time that

00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,890
I spent working on that initial

00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,300
prototype I could have eliminated it had

00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:16,660
actually gone to the trouble of speaking

00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:18,790
to a plumber first just because we had

00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,290
an idea and I could implement the idea

00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,510
in software that didn't mean we had a

00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:24,310
good business idea it meant we had a

00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:27,130
good idea for a hobby project and the

00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,990
difference is crucial a business is an

00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,030
idea that generates revenue a hobby

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,980
project may be fun to work on it may

00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,600
even be useful for other people but if

00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,060
you can't sell something if you can't

00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,490
pay the bills with that revenue it isn't

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:42,610
a business and conflating the two ideas

00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:45,580
is a major problem what we should have

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:48,160
done first is validate the idea and then

00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,810
build it but we didn't need to do that

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,160
when I finally had something to show off

00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,720
my business partner over the local

00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,979
newspaper picked a bunch of local

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,450
plumbers and called them in an attempt

00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:57,430
to sell this grand new idea that we had

00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,560
with our prototype and he called 10

00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,180
plumbers five of them suggested to be

00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,300
placed the idea in an anatomically

00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,800
implausible location four of them had

00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,320
their secretary provide exactly the same

00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,669
advice but one plumber did sound

00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,240
interested and he said he wanted to have

00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:13,030
a chat

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,200
this was mistake number two or at the

00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,810
very least it should have been a warning

00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,940
flag at the end of the day a business is

00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,680
about selling something selling a

00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,300
physical product a subscription selling

00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,580
a service but whatever they're doing is

00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,380
selling something and in order to sell

00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,930
something you have to have customers if

00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:31,750
all your prospective customers hang up

00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,820
when you call you have a problem you

00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,960
don't have a sales channel it doesn't

00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,880
matter if you've got a machine that

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,530
turns lead into gold if you can't get

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,690
that idea in front of people who are

00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:42,849
going to buy your product you might as

00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:44,169
well shut up shop right now the fact

00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:46,300
that it was very difficult to get

00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:47,560
plumbers to answer the phone

00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,090
should have been a warning sign that our

00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,039
perspective audience wasn't going to be

00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:54,039
easy to crack even if we had a perfect

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,960
technical solution but we persisted and

00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,250
we had a chat with the one plumber who

00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,960
would actually speak to us and we did

00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,720
our pitch and he said nope not

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,220
interested but if you can make that pile

00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,349
of paper disappear I'll give you as much

00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,000
money as you want this was a

00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:09,580
conversation that set the direction of

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,949
our company for years to come was this a

00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,330
mistake or a success well that's a

00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:14,740
little bit hard to judge there is an

00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,240
extent to which we change direction

00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,340
because it was the only direction that

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,289
seemed open to us which in itself was a

00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:23,759
bad move but it was also a very

00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:26,020
lucrative direction so maybe it's a wash

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,210
what we identified in this conversation

00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,889
was a significant business problem a

00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:32,650
business process that was being

00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:35,620
performed manually it took three hours a

00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:37,360
day to perform and identify identified a

00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,190
simple and reliable way that it could be

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,419
automated we identified a couple of

00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,099
other business processes that we could

00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:43,389
automate in a way to report on some key

00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:45,099
performance indicators in the business

00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:46,960
as a result of doing that that data

00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:48,940
processing and we identified a path

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,919
forward the way we could use mobile

00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,930
technology to improve process management

00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:55,000
communication and overall business

00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,919
outcomes by the time we don't we were

00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,650
done we'd worked out how to immediately

00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:02,740
flip free up one full-time employee with

00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:04,300
potential for a lot more so in theory as

00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,340
long as we charge less than the cost of

00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,259
that employee about 50,000 Australian a

00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:10,840
year the business owner would be ahead

00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:12,789
on paper our costs were next to nothing

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,199
and you found customer told us these

00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:16,659
business processes would use one

00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:17,860
specific contract that they had there

00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:20,020
were many other people on the same

00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,639
contract so it should have been easy to

00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,340
take the same software to everybody else

00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:25,900
on the contract and profit right well

00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,879
okay let's keep it simple offer them a

00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,770
50% saving on what they what they were

00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,240
originally spending and do a bit of

00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:33,130
fancy footwork to reverse-engineer a

00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,860
good explanation of why that was what we

00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:39,789
were charging just start making $25,000

00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:42,190
per year per customer right well no that

00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:44,050
was mistake number three mistake three

00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:46,660
is that we didn't take into account for

00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:48,610
the human factor in theory challenging

00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,709
anything less than 50 thousand dollars a

00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:54,190
year should have been rationally a

00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:56,589
no-brainer decision easy so but we were

00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,640
selling to humans and humans don't ever

00:08:56,589 --> 00:09:00,710
behave rationally

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,570
there is an almost bottomless body of

00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:04,250
research about how bad humans are at

00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:07,370
evaluating economic consequences and

00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,840
decisions and so when we walked in the

00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,190
door of a prospective customer we did a

00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,170
pitch and they were almost universally

00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:14,150
blown away and then we told them the

00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,940
price and they went back to describing

00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:20,330
anatomically implausible locations again

00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:20,720
why well first off humans aren't

00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:23,630
rational

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,820
a sale of that size $25,000 a year isn't

00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,530
easy ask a plumber to spend $100 a month

00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,640
they know they can afford that it's

00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:31,280
probably less than what they spend on

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,710
coffee at a month but I son to spend

00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,050
$2,000 a month that's a lot harder for

00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,370
them to justify that actually starts to

00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,170
make a dent in their bottom bottom line

00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,940
so they're gonna take some convincing

00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:43,280
they're gonna want some proof that it

00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,990
actually works that it's actually going

00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,930
to deliver the prompt the the benefit

00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:50,420
that you're promising secondly we were

00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,950
selling software while we were

00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,180
completely honorable and completely

00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,890
truthful and were able to deliver

00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,450
everything we promised and our software

00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,850
made birds suddenly appear every time we

00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:01,910
were near we weren't the first IT

00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:04,610
salesperson to darken their door and we

00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:06,740
collectively have a part of an industry

00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,630
that for 40 years has systematically

00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,910
over-promised and under-delivered what

00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:14,180
software can do for businesses that's

00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:15,460
something you need to overcome third we

00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,840
were selling software

00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,340
who here is currently holding a phone

00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,550
worth a couple of hundred maybe even

00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,500
$1,000 pretty much everyone in the room

00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,940
now how many of you give more

00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,280
consideration to whether you should buy

00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:31,610
a 99-cent app than you did on the

00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:33,380
decision to buy the phone almost exactly

00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:36,020
the same subset that's the problem

00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,730
selling software multiply it a thousand

00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:40,130
times when you start dealing with a non

00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,440
tech audience we have been conditioned

00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:44,840
to expect that physical tangible things

00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:48,890
are expensive but software that should

00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:50,480
be cheap better still free as a side

00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:52,430
note this is one of the major problems

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,450
we face funding open source projects as

00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,640
well but that's the subject for a

00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:58,130
completely different rant rant one that

00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,410
I've had many times before come see me

00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:01,430
if you want that round

00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:03,290
lastly we were dealing with personal

00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,490
relationships if we walked into a small

00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,290
plumbing business to speak with a

00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,940
manager there was an odds-on chance that

00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,130
the bookkeeper or another significant

00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,440
employee in the business was the wife of

00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,720
the manager and you start talking about

00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,889
the

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,069
efforts of being able to cut one

00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:20,459
administrative employee you can guess

00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:22,019
how well that conversation goes and even

00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:24,060
if it wasn't a family member people

00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:25,740
don't generally want to fire people they

00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,180
do it if it's necessary but they like

00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,720
the idea that they're building this big

00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,920
family mistake number four happened as

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,620
the result of an unfortunate coincidence

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,120
after closing our first sale we got that

00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,800
customer to give us an introduction to

00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,509
some other possible customers and he

00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,209
gave us the best options first

00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:44,850
so our first two sales were both $2,000

00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:45,870
a month at third sale was only $500 a

00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,279
month but that gave us the confidence

00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,949
that we had something that we could sell

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,810
to both medium and small businesses we'd

00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:53,040
close three sales in rapid succession we

00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,959
had four and a half thousand dollars a

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,060
month in revenue sales were really

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,759
painfully easy to close we thought we'd

00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:02,100
found a money printing machine and then

00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:05,100
we hit a wall the next few sales calls

00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:07,829
we made went nowhere never a hard no but

00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:11,370
lots of as an arse about price I have to

00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:13,410
think about it and balance it up my wife

00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:15,870
forgot I have to weigh into this we

00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:17,730
confused initial success with a pattern

00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:19,290
that was going to continue after three

00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,850
sales in less than a month we

00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,949
essentially didn't close another sale

00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,740
for eight months and that's not a good

00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:27,300
sign now arguably we did get bitten by

00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,069
circumstances there when you have lots

00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,649
of early success it's easy to think that

00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:33,480
that success is going to be ongoing it's

00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:35,009
very difficult to be objective and

00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,809
that's what you need to be if you can't

00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:39,420
consistently close sales if you can't

00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:42,269
reliably predict your close rate you

00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:44,009
have a problem mistake number five

00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:46,470
though was completely our fault we

00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:48,660
completely failed to do basic math our

00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,129
value proposition the business process

00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,720
that we had optimized existed because

00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:54,779
the process is required by one

00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,519
particular home maintenance contract our

00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:58,680
pricing scheme was simple we charged one

00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,180
dollar per job completed our initial

00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,980
customer they did about 2,000 jobs a

00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,540
month so we charged them 2,000 dollars a

00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,160
month which is great because it also

00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,540
happened to be almost exactly the 50%

00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,899
savings target that we originally

00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:12,240
identified what we didn't do was add up

00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:14,490
how many jobs they actually were in the

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,649
system and it turns out that if we had

00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:18,300
managed to close every company on that

00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:20,149
contract we still would have only

00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:23,069
generated $12,000 a month in revenue

00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:24,809
which sounds like a lot especially when

00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:25,889
your costs from hosting a cloud piece of

00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:27,689
software that doesn't

00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:30,720
have you know huge huge traffic

00:13:27,689 --> 00:13:33,059
requirements but our costs weren't low

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,489
we also had two founders who were

00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:37,939
full-time and needed to be paid our burn

00:13:35,489 --> 00:13:41,639
rate if we were fully paid was closer to

00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:43,470
$22,000 a month and this led to this

00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:45,029
mistake number six we didn't have my

00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:47,549
business partner I didn't have a serious

00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:50,249
pricing discussion until it was way too

00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:51,809
late misled by our initial success our

00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:53,369
pricing was essentially determined by

00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:55,199
taking our burn rate and working

00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:57,449
backwards not forwards from what the

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,919
market would bear my co-founder and I

00:13:57,449 --> 00:14:00,809
would end up having regular discussions

00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:02,220
about pricing but all those discussions

00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:03,869
happened against the background

00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,119
discussion of how are we going to make

00:14:03,869 --> 00:14:07,199
payroll this month which is the wrong

00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:08,639
time to be having that discussion

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,439
because two important options

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,759
drastically reducing the price and

00:14:10,439 --> 00:14:15,119
shutting down the company are

00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,919
effectively off the table so we had a

00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:18,929
product that was too expensive to sell a

00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:20,100
market that wasn't big enough now the

00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:22,739
good news was that the paperwork

00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,230
reduction niche that we'd found wasn't

00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:27,089
unique to that one contract but there

00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:29,669
were many other similar contracts with

00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:31,829
very similar paperwork requirements but

00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:33,629
we'd found the thousand pound gorilla in

00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,489
the market other contracts were similar

00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:36,720
and the paperwork processes were subtly

00:14:35,489 --> 00:14:39,239
different and needed to be customized

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,069
for each contract and that wouldn't have

00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:43,019
been a problem if we hadn't made mistake

00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:45,269
number seven we never established a

00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:47,429
sales channel we got our first sale

00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:48,889
almost by accident we bumped into a

00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:51,689
customer who gave us an opportunity

00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:53,999
subsequent sales came mostly by word of

00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:55,949
mouth word of mouth is an incredible

00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:58,019
sales channel if you can get it but as a

00:14:55,949 --> 00:15:00,179
result we never cracked the most

00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:02,910
important problem how do we sell to

00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:04,619
someone who hasn't heard of us how do we

00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:07,919
get in the door how do we establish

00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:09,600
trust and as a result our sales were

00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,239
essentially constrained by the personal

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,100
networks of our existing customers now

00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:16,259
person where I come from is a small

00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,999
geographically isolated City when we had

00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:19,769
exhausted the personal networks we

00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:22,139
hadn't learnt the most important thing

00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:23,899
how to sell our product to someone who

00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:26,220
didn't give us a personal introduction

00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:28,230
Joel Spolsky once noted that there's no

00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,869
software product priced between $1,000

00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:33,089
and $100,000 this is because a product

00:15:30,869 --> 00:15:34,829
that costs less than $1,000 can be

00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:36,299
bought in a credit card but its software

00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:38,039
costs more than something that can be

00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:39,510
hidden on an expense statement you need

00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:40,680
to have sales people and that mean

00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,120
you have to pay them and their

00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,350
commissions and to pay for the steak

00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,480
dinners and the drinks that they used to

00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:47,490
close the sale we had a product that was

00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,840
squarely in this dead zone it was too

00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:51,150
expensive to be a casual perk at

00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:54,290
purchase but not expensive enough to

00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:56,370
support the sales process that it needed

00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:58,710
transcloud had a serious problem once we

00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:00,750
closed the sale we had almost zero churn

00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:02,370
rate the only customers we ever lost

00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,260
were because the business actually shut

00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,730
down or they drop the contract where we

00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:08,250
offered any sort of commercial advantage

00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:10,620
what we didn't have what we never really

00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,480
established was a good way to prove to

00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,670
new customers that we were indeed that

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,040
good there wasn't a good or easy way to

00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:18,750
trial transcloud we were managing

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,300
processes that were at the core of a

00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,400
trades business those processes have to

00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,390
work and they can't be duplicated or

00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,710
double that because you know you're

00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,510
doubling the paperwork or doubling the

00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:29,460
overhead so there was no way to sort of

00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:32,220
stick your toe in the water you had to

00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:33,990
jump in or stay out and since we had a

00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,360
huge price tag most people were

00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,800
conservative and said no if they got a

00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,540
recommendation from someone they knew

00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:43,050
was a little bit easier but if that

00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,790
didn't exist we had a problem in order

00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:47,010
to close a sale people have to believe

00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:49,410
really believe what you're telling them

00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:50,640
it has to be obvious and undeniable that

00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:53,460
you will give them the benefit you're

00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,110
promising or the cost of trying has to

00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:57,900
be vastly less than the cost of software

00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:00,270
itself in our case even if we drop the

00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:02,280
price of our software to zero we still

00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:04,020
didn't have zero cost because the cost

00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,510
of institutional process change

00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:08,190
associated with adopting a new piece of

00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:09,510
software that is that represents the

00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:13,410
core of business operations

00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:14,579
that's huge our best salesperson was

00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:16,800
completely accidental

00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:19,530
he wasn't even our employee he was

00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,390
employee who changed employers about

00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:23,130
every six months he was in upper

00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,360
management he had a reputation for

00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,800
getting things done and turning

00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,810
companies around and so he kept getting

00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,580
poached and he'd seen the benefits of

00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,780
trades cloud at one contract so he was

00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,010
when he when he got moved to the next

00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,720
one he'd say hey how about we introduce

00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:36,390
trades cloud hey how about we introduce

00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,770
trades cloud and because he was known

00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,910
around the industry and he'd been hired

00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,950
because he knew what he was talking

00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:42,570
about his word was extremely valuable

00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,140
when he said this is good people

00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:46,560
believed him

00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:48,570
his word was trusted but even when we

00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,250
did make a sale the mistakes didn't stop

00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,809
mistake number eight we didn't pay

00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,299
enough attention to onboarding

00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:55,379
new customers a sale for a product

00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:57,450
particularly a subscription service

00:17:55,379 --> 00:17:58,769
product isn't closed when the contract

00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,629
is signed or when when the user gives

00:17:58,769 --> 00:18:02,460
you their credit card it's closed when

00:18:00,629 --> 00:18:03,990
the person who uses the software has

00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,179
accepted it into their daily lives

00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:08,009
because that's what prevents churn if

00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:10,139
you're if you're selling a small

00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:12,179
personal tool the person who buys it and

00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:14,309
the personal uses it probably the same

00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:15,899
person but in our case the purchase

00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:17,249
decision was very rarely made by the

00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:18,389
person who actually had to use the

00:18:17,249 --> 00:18:20,700
software on the ground at the end of the

00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:22,860
day and you have to get those people on

00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,419
board too if anything they're more

00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,710
important because they're the ones who

00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:27,570
are going to make the boss's life a

00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:29,220
living hell if the software that they've

00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:33,749
been forced to use isn't doing the job

00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:36,389
or worse is doing the job too well over

00:18:33,749 --> 00:18:37,799
and over we saw internal sabotage when

00:18:36,389 --> 00:18:40,139
transcloud was rolled out in companies

00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:43,259
people would simply refuse to change

00:18:40,139 --> 00:18:45,269
processes and they would find any excuse

00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:46,889
oh the software doesn't work so we had

00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:48,509
to go back to doing it manually oh the

00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:49,759
trade squad was down again it was like I

00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:53,190
couldn't could access it all afternoon

00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:54,869
and after a month or two the boss would

00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,950
then call us and say what happened all

00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:57,629
the benefits he promised they said you

00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:59,279
were down or last Friday I say no we

00:18:57,629 --> 00:19:00,539
were not down although Friday your guys

00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:01,889
weren't hitting the website and by the

00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,619
way here's the logs of all the hits we

00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:07,289
had from your your employees last week

00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:08,399
but that didn't matter because they only

00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:10,049
got the benefits if they used the

00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:11,519
software they weren't using the software

00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:14,399
so they weren't getting the benefit so

00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:16,080
they weren't happy about paying for what

00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:18,029
we learnt the hard way is that you have

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,100
to sell the business owner but you also

00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:21,659
have to sell to the users if you're

00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,490
dealing with with software that is a key

00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:26,249
part of business process change

00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:27,990
management is key you have to show the

00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:30,179
people using the software how your tool

00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:31,799
helps them do what they currently do by

00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:34,590
hand you have to show them that their

00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:37,019
jobs aren't at risk the first employee

00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:39,600
who's three hour a day task we replaced

00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:40,950
she wasn't fired she was redeployed

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,779
inside the business

00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:44,820
she went from doing a mindless office

00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:46,559
tasks for most of the day and she could

00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,480
start expanding into other parts of the

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,159
business about two years after we first

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,830
deployed transcloud she was running

00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:54,539
accounts and payroll in that company but

00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:56,159
despite all these mistakes that we'd

00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:57,840
made we were able to stumble along and

00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:00,240
we were completely funded a self-funded

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,519
for almost two years yes that did mean

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,080
burning a lot of personal funds and my

00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:04,690
co-founder doing a bunch of consulting

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,010
on the side

00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:07,420
of limited how much time he could spend

00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,860
doing sales which was its own set of

00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:11,800
problems but that's just part of the

00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:14,290
startup experience right well maybe it

00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,690
is but in retrospect mistake number nine

00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:17,860
was an entirely personal one I shouldn't

00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,780
have lost as much money on the

00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,220
experience as I did I knew what I

00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,630
considered success criteria the

00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,030
gold-plated Lamborghini sitting in the

00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:27,460
driveway but I never considered what my

00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:28,780
failure criteria would be after two

00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,580
years I'd reached a point where my

00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,530
personal financial runway was running

00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,300
out trades clown either needed to start

00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:36,040
paying a full-time wage or I wasn't

00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,410
gonna be able to continue and that

00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,600
pivoted the business fundraising is a

00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,590
full-time job

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,930
everything else goes on wholesale

00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:45,790
support development everything we tried

00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:47,320
to get VC investment but the VC seen in

00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:49,930
Australia particularly in Perth is

00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:52,480
pretty bad eventually we managed to sign

00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:54,310
a secured a $250,000 cash investment

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,780
from a colleague of my business partner

00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:57,370
we've got a bit of matching funding

00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,260
through an Australian government R&D

00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:02,260
program and that gave us another two

00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:04,180
years of runway but the way we were able

00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,470
to secure that runway was by changing

00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,210
our tactics instead of going after

00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,500
individual plumbers we started going

00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,970
after the head contractors the

00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,560
multi-million dollar facility management

00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,150
companies that were imposing this

00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,860
paperwork overhead on the smaller

00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:16,750
companies and we were able to sell them

00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,160
a really great story the companies are

00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,480
all really really competitive they're

00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,980
all looking for any advantage they can

00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,750
get to slice another half a percent

00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,730
profit margin out of things but they're

00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:27,040
also technologically laggards because

00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:28,630
they are big established companies so we

00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,610
were able to walk in and promised them a

00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:32,380
mobile enabled workforce and real-time

00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:35,170
employee tracking and enforced health

00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,370
and safety provisions and practices all

00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,930
sorts of things that made them really

00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:39,610
excited because they could use those

00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:42,550
features as differentiators against

00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:44,470
their competition but and here's mistake

00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:47,200
number ten we've forgot who we were and

00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:49,180
who we were selling to we were selling

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,440
to multi-million dollar companies the

00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,120
reason these companies are

00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,550
technologically Lagarde's they're

00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,920
conservative they don't take risks

00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:58,210
there's no incentive for an individual

00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,740
employee at a multi-million dollar

00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:02,260
company to take any risk

00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:04,990
and so they consistently make safe

00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:07,150
decisions when they adopt new technology

00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,380
they don't just pick something they put

00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,730
it out to tender and they get multiple

00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,780
bids and then they invite the bidders to

00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,610
come in to the head office and

00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:14,920
interrogate them and eventually after

00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:16,960
six months they pick someone the safe

00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,400
option we got into a tendering process

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,110
with almost

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,550
every major facility management company

00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:24,340
in Australia the tendering process

00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:26,080
almost always started because we pitched

00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,030
them the idea of providing trades cloud

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,490
to their subcontractors what they heard

00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:32,770
was provide software to our

00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:34,720
subcontractors and so at the end of a

00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:37,240
six month trading a tendering process

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,520
multiple trips over across the country

00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,020
on flights and staying and long day long

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,220
interviews and meetings and writing

00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:45,100
tender papers and so on

00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:47,500
we were told every time without fault we

00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,730
prefer your technological solution but

00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,280
we're going to go with your competitor

00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,360
because you're just too risky a

00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,980
two-person company was too much of a

00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,750
risk for a multimillion-dollar company

00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,980
to trust nevermind the fact that the

00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,420
minute you sign at multi-million dollar

00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,960
contract you cease being a true person

00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:03,280
company so after two years of trying

00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,900
this tactic and being turned down by

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,830
pretty much every facility management

00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,450
company in Australia

00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:09,730
the money was running out again and I'd

00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,900
built up a cash buffer again in between

00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:12,670
failing to sell to multinational

00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,680
companies we'd accidentally found a

00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:16,240
little bit of success selling to smaller

00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,400
facility management companies and large

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,660
construction companies and the good news

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,250
that these companies were big enough

00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,840
that when they bought software they

00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:24,880
weren't a customized to exactly what

00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,200
they want so as well as the $2,000 a

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,700
month they were willing to pay they'd

00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,350
pay forty fifty thousand dollars up

00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,880
front so that everything matched their

00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:33,280
requirements exactly like they wanted

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,020
them and on the back of that change we

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,880
got a loan from our Investor and between

00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,290
making some more personal sacrifices we

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,990
got that cash injection we're able to

00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:43,450
stumble along for another 18 months this

00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:45,880
was mistake number 11 we didn't take the

00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:47,800
hint each one of these points we took

00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,300
investment was potentially a point that

00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,460
would have been a natural place to shut

00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,410
down the business and in retrospect we

00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,780
should have the writing was on the wall

00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:57,760
the simple truth is if you can't close

00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,680
sales you do not have a business and

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,790
yeah you can stumble along hoping you're

00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,710
going to find that missing sales

00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:04,180
ingredient but that takes resources it

00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:06,910
takes money it takes emotional capital

00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:08,470
as well one of the reasons the failure

00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:10,390
of trades cloud was personally so

00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:12,550
galling to me is that it didn't fail for

00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:14,980
any reason that I would consider to be

00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:17,500
my fault from a purely technical

00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:19,030
perspective we were significantly more

00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,010
reliable than the multinational

00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:22,780
companies we were integrating with we

00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:24,610
delivered new features in time frames

00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:27,250
our customers considered inconceivable

00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:28,360
when I went in and did demonstrations to

00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,670
these multimillion-dollar head

00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,080
contractors they expressed doubt that we

00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,350
could actually do what I said we were

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,270
doing

00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:37,270
right up until the moment that I showed

00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:39,730
them doing it live but none of that

00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:41,980
mattered trades cloud failed ultimately

00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:43,240
because we couldn't sell what we had or

00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,010
at least we couldn't sell it in

00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,020
quantities that enabled us to cover our

00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:48,520
costs and when you're there giving your

00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,200
all and doing things that have been

00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,690
called magic by prospective customers

00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,789
and you're still failing that's hard to

00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:56,020
internalize and when you layer on the

00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:57,400
fact that a layer on top of that the

00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:59,200
fact that I'm a husband and a father and

00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,179
the sole income for the family that

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,039
introduces all sorts of guilt son fear

00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:04,750
into the mix and then you take all that

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,950
stress and add in all the long hours and

00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,179
the weekend work and the desperate hope

00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,640
that this will be the thing that saves

00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:11,650
the company and you start to understand

00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:14,860
why two years ago I had a major

00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:16,659
depressive episode mistake number 12 I

00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,809
lost sight of the fact that quitting is

00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:23,020
always an option and quitting doesn't

00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:24,580
mean failure if after two years I had

00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:26,740
taken an honest audit of where we were

00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:29,320
as a company and said you know what this

00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:31,299
isn't working I'm out I would have had

00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,470
four years of my life back that's four

00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:34,840
years I could have sunk into a different

00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:36,580
project but I didn't pay attention or

00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,770
enough attention to my science I

00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:41,710
conflated the success of this company

00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:43,090
with my own personal success and I lost

00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:45,640
sight of the fact that at the end of the

00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:47,470
day it was a job it was meant to provide

00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,970
some income some intellectual engagement

00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:52,630
and if it wasn't doing that

00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:55,020
walking away was always an option but I

00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:57,549
never really considered that seriously

00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,659
why not well that's kind of mistake

00:25:57,549 --> 00:26:00,850
number thirteen and it was another

00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:02,380
personal failure I didn't stand up to my

00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:04,450
co-founder as much as I should have and

00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:06,669
as a result we wasted a lot of time and

00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:07,750
effort in some cases money now I have to

00:26:06,669 --> 00:26:08,890
be clear if I need because there's a

00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:11,950
chance that market might actually see

00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:13,900
this video I'm not blaming mark here

00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:15,880
mark is a great guy he's extremely

00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,440
talented he's got absolutely no shame at

00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,059
fronting up the company's thousands of

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,679
times bigger than his and telling them

00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:22,000
how they should be doing things he

00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:24,130
opened doors that I wouldn't even

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,169
considered knocking on let alone opening

00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,669
he was a real asset to the business the

00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:30,220
the failure here was a personal one and

00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:32,230
it was mine we didn't go into trades

00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:34,299
Clair's complete equals now okay sure we

00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:36,159
were 50/50 partners on paper but when I

00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:38,409
met mark he was my first boss out of

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,240
university I worked for him for four

00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:43,390
years as a relatively junior employee

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,340
and a lot of that power dynamic remained

00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:46,279
I let him do a lot of things because

00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,320
while he must

00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:49,820
no what are you doing right I caved on

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,429
decisions because I could see his side

00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,269
and he was more experienced and

00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:54,859
unfortunately well fortunately

00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:56,749
mark he's a great sales guy he could

00:26:54,859 --> 00:26:58,849
make you believe in things and he made

00:26:56,749 --> 00:27:00,830
me believe in trades cloud but that's a

00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:02,749
double-edged sword it got me through all

00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:04,580
sorts of lows but it also meant that I

00:27:02,749 --> 00:27:06,469
believed in things when I probably

00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:08,239
shouldn't have been I should have put my

00:27:06,469 --> 00:27:10,070
foot down and said no more a lot more

00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:11,960
often than I did both for the benefit of

00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:15,049
the business and for my own mental

00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,489
health and so when the money ran out for

00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:18,259
the third time no the mark nor myself

00:27:16,489 --> 00:27:19,700
had the energy to continue we had a

00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:21,259
lock-up of last hail that last-minute

00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,059
Hail Mary options that we thought might

00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:24,619
have saved us but one by one they fell

00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:26,359
through and in the end we were

00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:28,669
eventually able to pay back the loan to

00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:30,440
our investor but his equity investment

00:27:28,669 --> 00:27:31,700
was essentially lost and in January of

00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,429
this year we closed our doors for the

00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:37,009
last time and that's the trades cloud

00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:39,320
story now I do warn you the plural of

00:27:37,009 --> 00:27:40,580
anecdote is not data this is my story

00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,950
there are many stories that are like it

00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:44,570
but this one is mine I don't profess to

00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:46,129
having any particular business insight I

00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:48,589
just know that trades cloud didn't work

00:27:46,129 --> 00:27:51,679
and these are the 13 reasons that I can

00:27:48,589 --> 00:27:52,999
identify why in the aftermath I've had a

00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,190
lot of people many of them in this room

00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:57,679
who have reached out and given me a

00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:59,059
virtual hug or a spoon and many of them

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,450
are asked me if I was sad to see trades

00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:05,690
cloud go but frankly the emotion that I

00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:07,999
had was relief on January 31st 2017 I

00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:10,039
slept like I hadn't slept for six years

00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:11,330
because I knew I wasn't going to be

00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:13,129
woken up at two o'clock in the morning

00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,330
by a server alarm and I knew I could

00:28:13,129 --> 00:28:15,769
sleep in because I wasn't gonna get a

00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,909
support call at 6 o'clock from someone

00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:19,339
who couldn't find the on switch on their

00:28:16,909 --> 00:28:21,289
phone the fact that I wasn't even

00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:22,549
slightly disappointed by the loss of

00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:24,830
trades grant from my life that's the

00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:27,649
biggest sign for me that I waited far

00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:29,179
too long to walk away the good news

00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:30,710
though is that the process of running

00:28:29,179 --> 00:28:32,929
trades cloud hasn't burned me out

00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:35,539
completely it was an amazing learning

00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:37,489
experience and I landed on my feet at

00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:38,509
jeguk on us last year I put my name up

00:28:37,489 --> 00:28:41,089
in the jobs board saying I was

00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:42,649
potentially looking and I'd have been

00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:44,389
there like all of half a day before my

00:28:42,649 --> 00:28:46,489
good friend Andrea Pinkham approached me

00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:48,789
and said are you that Russell Keith

00:28:46,489 --> 00:28:48,789
McGee

00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:53,140
the other silver lining is the trades

00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:54,640
clad experience drew my attention to

00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,080
problems in the world of mobile

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,990
development which has influenced the

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,130
path of my new toy beware and I've been

00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:02,470
busy trying to work out how to turn

00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:03,960
beware into something but this time I'm

00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:06,550
a little older I'm a little grayer

00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,750
hopefully a little wiser and I should

00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:09,610
have a better idea of what I'm looking

00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:13,090

00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:14,350

00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:17,050
