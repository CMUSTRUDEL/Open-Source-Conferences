	DjangoCon US 2017 - Why can't everyone just do what I want them to? Leadership, management, and working with people who don't think like you by Briana Morgan

Do you pride yourself on your post-it and Sharpie collection? Do you set appointments for yourself in your own calendar - that you actually show up for? Do you write to-do lists on your hand, since you’ll forget if the to-do isn’t right in front of your face? Do you own - and use - a label maker? Do you hate New Year’s resolutions because the whole idea of starting new habits on January 1 is an artificial construct?

People are weird. We all have some pretty particular ways we think, work, and get motivated. It’s hard enough when we’re just trying to focus on ourselves, but it gets even more complicated when we add other people to the mix. What happens when a whiteboard person has to work with a spreadsheet person - or even harder, lead a whole team of spreadsheet people?

This talk will focus on practical tips for working better with others - especially when you’re in a leadership or management position, although we all lead in different ways. We’ll start off with an overview of productivity and motivational styles, identifying how they influence the way we all think and work. Then, we’ll pinpoint how our own personal productivity and motivational styles impact us and those around us. After that, we’ll figure out how to look for clues about our colleagues’ working styles. Finally, we’ll talk about strategies for bridging our working styles with those of the people around us. You’ll leave with insights about what makes you tick, plus actionable tools to improve your leadership skills and enhance your working relationships.

[Music]

00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:20,880
hi everybody

00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,439
so the question on everyone's minds why

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,020
can't everyone just do what I want them

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,180
to leadership management and working

00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,850
with people who don't think like you

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,090
which is probably just about everyone on

00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:35,309
the planet so we're gonna start with a

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,980
seemingly unrelated story that has

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:39,839
nothing to do with anything a few months

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,359
ago I decided to participate in

00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:45,089
something called the hundred day project

00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:48,179
the hundred day project is run by Al

00:00:45,089 --> 00:00:50,819
Luna who does a talk and has written a

00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:53,639
book about the crossroads of should and

00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:56,429
must the idea is that for a hundred days

00:00:53,639 --> 00:00:59,219
you did something creative same thing

00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:03,179
every single day took a picture of it

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,830
and post it on Instagram I decided I

00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:06,540
want to learn how to draw I've never

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,670
been good at it my mom's great at

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,110
drawing she's great at painting the

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,140
problem is when you decide to learn

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:16,140
something new as an adult you feel

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,150
really dumb and really clumsy those of

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,600
you who loon who learned to code as an

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:24,330
adult probably have experienced this so

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,940
I'm going to show you for some reason

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,380
the very first drawing I did in the

00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:34,610
drawing assessment as they learned to

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:34,610
draw any guesses as to what this is

00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:42,960
shark is close but it wasn't in fact an

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,270
airplane it's a terrible airplane but

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,860
but one thing that you get from trying

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:51,330
to do something new as an adult is a

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:53,430
very strong sense of humility and that's

00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:55,320
kind of what I want to talk about today

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,909
learning a lot about yourself so you can

00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,700
apply that to the people to the

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,590
relationships with the people around you

00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:04,590
how many people in here became a leader

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,970
by accident like you didn't really mean

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,250
to and then all of a sudden you were in

00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,629
charge of a committee or something and

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,659
then you're looking around lay on out

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:14,099
the hands are still going up like what

00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:15,930
am I gonna do this

00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:17,790
yeah working with people is a skill

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,720
that's separate from anything else that

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,520
we do in our job

00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,770
and that kind of gets back to what Laci

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,230
was saying yesterday about what it is to

00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,330
have a soft stalkers as a technical talk

00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:33,280
when realistically we're working with

00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:35,650
people all the time so Who am I and why

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,620
am i doing this talk I am Brianna Morgan

00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:40,930
I work in public health full time I also

00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,730
do some digital strategy I'm the

00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,040
president of the Philadelphia area new

00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:47,470
media Association I'm a co-organizer of

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,990
BarCamp Philly which is about to be in

00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:52,000
its tenth year I do marketing for an

00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:54,790
intentional living app called and

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,670
tired-out life I make poor drawings of

00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,260
airplanes and I spend a lot of time

00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:02,440
working with different types of people

00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:05,380
so what we're gonna do today we're gonna

00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,690
start off with an overview of habit

00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,980
formation tendencies I'll explain that

00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,630
in in a second

00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,550
there's gonna be a self-assessment

00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,260
component and then there's going to be a

00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,270
short exercise and reflection on that

00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,850
then we're gonna repeat that with

00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:22,030
productivity styles and then we'll have

00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:24,130
a conclusion so you're going to need for

00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,830
this talk you're either your Notes app

00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,730
or a pen and paper or whatever you have

00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,990
because at some point there's going to

00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,390
be a bit of a quiz and you're gonna need

00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:34,020
to write your answers down we're gonna

00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:36,160
spend most of our time on ourselves and

00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,990
then we're going to apply the lessons

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,670
that we learn from that to the people

00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:42,370
around us you'll get some specific

00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:45,850
strategies and tips for recognizing

00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,050
behaviors and other people and one thing

00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,460
that's important to remember that

00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,960
despite the fact that we're gonna spend

00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,060
a lot of our time thinking about

00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,680
ourselves that not everything is about

00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,750
you and the way that people interact

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,270
with you is more about them that it is

00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,040
about you and so that's why there's this

00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:04,390
really strong component of figuring out

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:06,450
how you interact with other people all

00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,920
right so why are we starting with habits

00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:11,050
for one habits are stronger than reason

00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:15,130
there is a paper out of Duke University

00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:17,200
in about 2006 that identified that forty

00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,390
to forty five percent of the behaviors

00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,030
that we repeat every day are based in

00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,710
habits so the way that you form habits

00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,120
has really important implications for

00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:28,210
how you work and really important

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,560
implications for how your team works so

00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,550
the framework we're going to use here is

00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,320
Gretchen Reubens for tendency

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:36,710
this is based on a book that she wrote

00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,570
called better than before and she's

00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,640
going to actually be releasing a whole

00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,070
new book entirely on the fore tendency

00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,510
is because it was such a popular idea

00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:49,070
it's based on whether you're internally

00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:51,460
motivated or externally motivated so our

00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:53,720
first personality type is the upholder

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,730
these are the people that you can rely

00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,100
on for absolutely everything they're

00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:00,830
motivated by internal expectations and

00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,510
external expectations there are the

00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,400
people who can tell themselves we're

00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:07,370
going to get up tomorrow at 5:30 and go

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,960
on a run and they'll do it and they'll

00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,640
go to work and do everything they said

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,560
they'd do at work and then they'll meet

00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,690
their friends for dinner at 7 o'clock at

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,100
night and then show somebody around town

00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:20,540
at 9:00 because they said they would do

00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:22,850
all those things the next type is the

00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:25,250
questioner the questioner is usually

00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,320
internally motivated but it can be

00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,070
externally motivated if there's a good

00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,320
reason for it

00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,820
they'll go for a run at 5:30 in the

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,520
morning because somebody said running is

00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:36,350
a good idea for them but only after they

00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,390
research why running at 5:30 in the

00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,950
morning is a good idea for them they're

00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:44,690
also the people who ask questions all

00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:45,860
throughout your team meetings the

00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,620
obligors are the people who are

00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,060
motivated by what other people want

00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,920
they'll get up at 5:30 to go for a run

00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:56,930
if you have a friend that they're gonna

00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:59,750
wet down if they don't show up and the

00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:02,330
fourth tendency is the rebel the rebel

00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:04,220
accepts no expectations of any kind from

00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,900
anyone you'll never see them running

00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,160
around at 5:30 in the morning because

00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,910
they don't want you to tell them what to

00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:13,550
do I I personally am a rebel it's a

00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:15,140
pretty rare personality type I don't

00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:19,220
really wish it upon other people because

00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:22,490
it's pretty difficult to manage recently

00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:26,150
I attended an open mic with my boyfriend

00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:27,920
there was a section where there the

00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:30,020
artists asked people to clap and stomp

00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,250
along to the song which is a pretty

00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,280
normal thing to do when you see a

00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:36,860
musical performance but we sat there for

00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,300
the song I clapped and stomped along for

00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,800
maybe half of a verse he did it the

00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,290
whole time and at the end he leaned over

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,850
he said you know I always did musical

00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,889
theater so I always play along with

00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,379
audience participation

00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:49,710
when people ask me to I looked him and I

00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:51,969
was like yeah I was in theater too but

00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:55,719
man I hate it when people tell me what

00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:59,490
to do so I'll be nice and to it for a

00:06:55,719 --> 00:07:03,689
little bit you know for appearances but

00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:06,129
so with that we're going to do a brief

00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:08,169
truncated version of the assessment on

00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:09,789
the four different personality types to

00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:10,779
kind of figure out where you fall and

00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:12,249
then we're going to talk about what that

00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:14,259
means for you and what it means for the

00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:15,900
people around you so this is going to be

00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:18,969
six questions it's a multiple-choice

00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:21,009
ABCD so you know if you're the person

00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:22,870
who's really into having the right thing

00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:28,389
done you can number your paper down the

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:31,870
left side 1 2 3 4 5 6 so question number

00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:34,110
one do you keep New Year's resolutions

00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:37,089
if your aren't accountable to anyone a

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:39,909
yes I'm good at keeping resolutions even

00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:41,770
ones that no one knows about but me B

00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:43,259
I'm good at keeping resolutions but I

00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:47,529
make them whenever it seems right

00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:49,569
January 1st is an arbitrary date see I

00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:51,370
don't usually make resolutions like that

00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:53,289
when I'm only helping myself I often

00:07:51,370 --> 00:08:01,569
struggle or do you know I hate

00:07:53,289 --> 00:08:03,789
restricting myself right - are you most

00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:05,649
likely to frustrate yourself because a I

00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:07,740
can't take a break from my usual habits

00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:10,029
or break the rules even when I want to

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:13,120
be my constant need for information

00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:14,770
exhausts me see I can take time for

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,219
other people but I can't take time for

00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:25,029
myself D as soon as I'm expected to do

00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:26,800
something I don't want to do it 3 what

00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:29,169
best describes review about your

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,879
commitments to yourself I take my

00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:33,550
commitments to myself as seriously as

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,469
take commitments to other people B I

00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:37,959
only make commitments to myself if it

00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:39,490
really makes sense to see if someone

00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:40,899
else is holding me accountable for my

00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:43,120
commitments I'll meet them but I

00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:46,649
struggle if only I know or D I bind

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,649
myself as little as possible

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,680
for when you've formed a healthy habit

00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,389
in the past what helped it stick hey I'm

00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,290
good at sticking to habits even when no

00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:06,240
one else cares be doing a lot of

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:10,439
research and customization about why and

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,120
how I might keep that habit see I could

00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:15,060
stick to a good habit only when I was

00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:19,250
answerable to someone else or D I don't

00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,250
usually choose to bind myself in advance

00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,939
five if people complain about your

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,920
behavior you'd be least surprised to

00:09:26,939 --> 00:09:31,350
hear and some of you may have heard some

00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,120
of these things before and you stick to

00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,540
your habits even when it's inconvenient

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,550
for other people B you ask way too many

00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,230
questions

00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:41,910
C you're good at taking time for others

00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:45,029
but you're not good at taking time for

00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:51,569
yourself or do you only do what you want

00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:54,240
to do when you want to do it and the

00:09:51,569 --> 00:09:58,709
final one six which description suits

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,870
you best a disciplined even when it

00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:05,160
doesn't make sense

00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:07,319
B asks necessary questions C puts others

00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:16,199
clients family friends co-workers first

00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:18,480
or D refuses to be bossed by others so

00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:20,699
if this isn't wildly obvious a was the

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,209
upholder the people who meet internal

00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:26,629
and external expectations if you have

00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:29,370
mostly B's you're probably a questioner

00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:33,300
if you have mostly C's you're an obligor

00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:36,889
if you have mostly DS or a rebel so how

00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,889
many people came out as upholders

00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:43,339
excellent how about questioners B's

00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:48,050
alright obligers C's

00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:59,810
and rebels sorry guys I I did Oh also

00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:01,190
are there any people who came out as a

00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:06,830
rebel but didn't raise your hand because

00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:09,410
I asked you to all right so I did a

00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:11,150
super super formal assessment this way

00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:13,760
among forty-four of my Facebook friends

00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:16,490
who happen to be around at the time of

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,810
the 44:25 war obligers and 15 were

00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:20,660
questioners which are the two most

00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:24,080
common habit formation types I got three

00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,870
rebels which is the rarest and by the

00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:30,140
way this is not like a statistically

00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:32,570
valid in any way sample and I got one

00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:34,670
upholder and I my my theory on that is

00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:36,290
that upholders aren't sitting around on

00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:43,790
Facebook taking quizzes that their

00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:45,560
friends post alright so this is a quote

00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,120
from Gretchen Rubin who came up with

00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,010
this four tendencies framework in the

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,450
first place

00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,920
we won't make ourselves more creative

00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:55,070
and productive by copying other people's

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,110
habits even the habits of geniuses we

00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:59,600
must know our own nature and what habits

00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,860
serve us best right so I mean we're all

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,680
people with the Internet we've seen

00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,420
medium articles right how many

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,950
productivity hacks have you seen that

00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,530
would never in a million years work for

00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:11,750
you or the way you think and so we're

00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:12,440
gonna we're gonna do this by personality

00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,620
type

00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,420
so the upholders what's the perk of

00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,950
being an upholder you're capable of

00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,690
working independently and you're highly

00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,980
motivated by to-do list you can get

00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,480
things done without a whole lot of

00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,850
oversight and that's a great thing that

00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,920
you can have in a team member the

00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:30,610
problem is that you can often wind up on

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,480
a never-ending quest for gold stars

00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:34,310
constantly trying to get to the next

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,160
accomplishment always doing the next

00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:39,170
thing another issue that might have some

00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,090
upholders is there a completely baffled

00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:42,830
by people who struggle with things if

00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:45,200
you've ever had a boss or a co-worker

00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:47,270
who says something like I don't know why

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,460
they can't just get it done we told them

00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:53,870
it needed to be done

00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:55,399
maybe you've said that yourself so

00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,870
strategies for upholders they're

00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,430
naturally good at habit so if you're

00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:01,399
working with somebody who's an upholder

00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:02,690
you're you're in luck one way if you

00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:04,250
have an upholder that's trying to

00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:06,050
perform better at work you can get them

00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,850
to track or monitor their current

00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,410
behaviors that's something that works

00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:12,560
really well for them like doing time

00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:14,360
logs any kind of scheduling an upholder

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,760
does tend to do really well with

00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,920
blocking out calendar time for for doing

00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,930
specific tasks they also work really

00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,839
well with clearly defined rules so if

00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:25,880
you're supervising an upholder and you

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,589
can clearly outline exactly what they're

00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,700
supposed to be doing that works really

00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:30,080
well for them they just want to know

00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:34,089
what the expectations are they'll meet

00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:36,470
them on their own questioners

00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:38,630
questioners it turns out really hate

00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,459
waiting in line they don't seem to

00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:43,279
understand why lines exist or why they

00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:45,770
have to stand in them they are motivated

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,970
by logic and reasoning and are very good

00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:50,660
at doing things that they've already

00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:53,029
decided to do you do have to get them

00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,470
there so when you're working with the

00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:56,120
questionnaire you need to be prepared to

00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,709
answer whatever questions they might

00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,180
have and they will have a lot of why

00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:00,770
questions you know the thing where you

00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,650
hang out with the toddler and the

00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:06,650
toddler ask why why why some people are

00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:08,750
just always like that so keep an eye out

00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:10,640
for that there can be some tension about

00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:13,970
them always asking questions and

00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:16,430
meetings just never-ending parade of

00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:18,410
wise and the questioners also have a

00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:24,410
hard time making choices if they don't

00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:25,940
have a complete set of information so in

00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:28,310
terms of habit strategies for

00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:30,200
questioners questioners

00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:32,450
really want to understand why something

00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,339
exists why is this process this way why

00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:35,750
are we looping this person in why why do

00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:37,160
we have to do why do we have to build

00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,410
this thing at all

00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,060
so be clear about what you're trying to

00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,860
do clarity is a strategy that works

00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,660
really wonderfully for questioners and

00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,630
the other thing that works great with

00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:51,589
questioners is identifying any loopholes

00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:53,300
in advance right so if you know that if

00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:55,040
if you're a questioner trying to

00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,620
establish a new habit and you know that

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,970
you're prone to saying oh well I'll do

00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:02,600
the thing I was supposed to do tomorrow

00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:05,000
because I'll still do it just not now

00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,339
you can kind of plan around that or the

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,420
whole like oh well I'll just work on

00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:11,420
this thing that's not the highest

00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:14,709
priority because I feel like it but

00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:16,850
tomorrow tomorrow we'll do it

00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:18,829
obligers are great team players but

00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:21,019
they're prone to burnout the obligors

00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:22,399
are the people who will if they need if

00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:24,500
you need somebody to do something on a

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,990
team they will jump up and do it if you

00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,250
send them a slack message at 12:30 in

00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,560
the morning they will get up and take

00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:34,670
care of the thing the problem is they

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:38,630
that's exhausting and you can only tap

00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:40,519
into that for so long for our blinders

00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:43,430
they do really want accountability

00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:44,329
regular meetings if you're supervising

00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,699
an obligor

00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:48,949
then meeting with them maybe once or

00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:50,240
twice a week so that they are

00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:51,949
accountable for doing the things that

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,990
they said they were gonna do they also

00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:59,660
do it really well with habit tracking

00:15:53,990 --> 00:16:02,839
with any partners and rebels are great

00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:05,360
at coming up with new ideas they often

00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:07,100
will only come up with new ideas but

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,000
they're also willing to take risks risks

00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:13,699
you got to watch out there they're

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:20,779
oppositional in terms of habit

00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:22,610
strategies for rebels good luck it's the

00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:25,040
thing that's worked for me as a rebel I

00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:26,720
can say is to create a situation in

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,970
which making the choice that I want to

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,290
make is a little bit easier and in

00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,389
public health terms we call this a

00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:34,910
structural intervention it's the idea of

00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:36,889
if you're trying to eat better than take

00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,209
the potato chips out of your house so

00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:39,529
you can still have the dealerships if

00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:40,670
you want them but you have to drive down

00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:43,579
the street to get them and it's much

00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:47,060
harder you can also tie habits to

00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:49,569
identity it reminds me a lot of Seth

00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:52,550
Godin and the marketer talks a lot about

00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:55,490
identifying you know people like us do

00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:58,310
things like this and you can do that for

00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:00,410
ruble habit tendencies as well right the

00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:04,250
idea is people like me do things like

00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:06,380
this I'm the kind of person who goes

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:11,959
home and studies every day and then

00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:13,520
unties the habit to that alright so what

00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:14,790
I would like you to do now is very

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,670
briefly in

00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:21,630
two minutes turn to somebody near you

00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:23,910
and ask how they're asked for what the

00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:26,370
result was and what the last habit was

00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:30,330
that they tried to form and whether or

00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:32,730
not it worked this is amazing

00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:34,500
all right so it sounded like people are

00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:37,550
having some pretty robust conversations

00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:40,500
and just have keep a little note

00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:43,320
mentally of what you learned from your

00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,270
conversation with your new neighbors we

00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:50,010
are going to move into productivity

00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:52,710
styles this comes from Carson Tate's

00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:56,490
book work simply and again we're going

00:17:52,710 --> 00:18:00,360
to be doing a truncated assessment the

00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:02,160
first style is prioritize er prioritize

00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,870
errs and people who always know what's

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,730
next they are ruthless

00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:07,470
they love spreadsheets they probably

00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:12,810
loved kodos talk on spreadsheets

00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:15,870
yesterday next up is the planner the

00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:21,480
planner is huge on deadlines you will

00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:23,310
commonly find them in Trello the third

00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,410
is the arranger the Ranger is very

00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:30,360
people centered there are often making

00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:32,640
introductions and the fourth is the

00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,680
vigil visualizer the visualizer is a big

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:39,180
picture person they are very idea

00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:40,440
focused right so this assessment is

00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,360
gonna work a little bit differently

00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,490
we're gonna have four sets of four

00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,430
questions you're gonna rate yourself on

00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:49,080
a scale of one to five which is on the

00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,940
slide so you'll know what it is one is

00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:54,810
this never applies to you and five is

00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:59,790
yeah that's that's me you know that so

00:18:54,810 --> 00:19:04,650
questions at one 1a I use a prioritized

00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:09,750
list to complete my work one is never

00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:12,810
three is sometimes five is always one B

00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:15,620
I designate specific time periods for

00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,620
certain tasks

00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:25,429
one see it is hard for me to take time

00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:25,429
to play while there's still work to do

00:19:27,349 --> 00:19:34,129
one D when I plan a project I think

00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:34,129
about the project goals first

00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:56,560
set to to a I am often late

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:59,160
one never five always six if you're not

00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,160
in the room yet

00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:13,300
to be daydreaming gives me insights and

00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:19,240
solutions to big problems to see I

00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:21,730
complete my best work under pressure to

00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:28,720
D when I brainstorm I sketch or draw my

00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:32,340
ideas anybody was in Melanie's talk

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,340
earlier I feel like that applies to her

00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:42,820
question set three again one is never

00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:50,320
five as always 3a I have trouble telling

00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:53,370
my colleagues no 3b I blocked time on my

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,370
calendar to complete my work

00:20:54,330 --> 00:21:03,610
3c I tend to underestimate how long it

00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:06,010
takes to complete tasks and projects 3d

00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:10,320
I am selective about the tools like pens

00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:10,320
paper folders etc that you use

00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:31,630
final set of questions for a I plan for

00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:36,429
the next day for B I use a deadline as a

00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:38,740
time frame for completion for C I

00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:43,660
eliminate the physical clutter in my

00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:46,980
office and for D a complete project

00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,980
tasks in sequential order

00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:56,450
all right so when you're done with that

00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:58,399
what you want to do is add your total up

00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:03,739
for each section and figure out which

00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:07,009
one is the the biggest number it might

00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:08,599
be close you might have some ties these

00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:10,669
aren't really mutually exclusive the way

00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:16,460
that the habit formation tendencies can

00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:19,009
be so if your highest number was in the

00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:22,759
first set of questions you are primarily

00:22:19,009 --> 00:22:26,359
a prioritize er if it was number two

00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:29,720
you're mostly a visualizer it was number

00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:33,489
three you're primarily an arranger and

00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:38,359
if your highest number was number four

00:22:33,489 --> 00:22:40,789
then you're a planner so before we go on

00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:45,470
with this because this is a hot topic in

00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:49,159
the workplaces your way of doing things

00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:51,349
is not the best way of doing things if

00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:54,349
you are lucky your way of doing things

00:22:51,349 --> 00:22:58,489
is the best way for you to do things and

00:22:54,349 --> 00:22:59,840
it's probably not even that all right so

00:22:58,489 --> 00:23:01,519
now we're gonna have some pictures of

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,220
lemurs because I felt like including

00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:06,019
pictures of lemurs in my slides lemurs

00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,279
are one of my favorite animals and last

00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:13,099
year I got to go to the Duke lemur

00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:17,179
center Adrienne also loves weavers all

00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:19,609
right so this is our first lemur this is

00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:24,229
the prioritize er because they're third

00:23:19,609 --> 00:23:26,029
they're ranked lemurs this this is I

00:23:24,229 --> 00:23:27,229
know I'm trying really hard and reaching

00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:31,820
for this one but I really want to have

00:23:27,229 --> 00:23:34,309
lemurs alright so how to identify a

00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:37,460
prioritize er in the wild how many of

00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:39,889
you came out as prioritize errs and all

00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,720
right so prioritize errs tend to have a

00:23:39,889 --> 00:23:43,759
little bit more of tradition traditional

00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,950
spaces that they work in not a lot of

00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:48,019
excess their desk is mostly going to

00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:49,549
have their current work on it tend to

00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:51,799
get distracted by having lots of other

00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:53,720
things around again this is not always a

00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:56,269
hundred percent true but this is where

00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,729
you kind of thrive prioritize errs love

00:23:56,269 --> 00:24:01,029
data and debate the big fans of the

00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:03,499
phrase work smarter not harder

00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:05,669
they hate hanging around and just

00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:08,329
talking for no reason

00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:11,039
it's like small talk is not their thing

00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:12,839
vague directions any long extended

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,719
emotional reactions to anything

00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:19,559
especially in a business context not a

00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:22,440
fan of that either I wrote up sample

00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:26,729
emails for each of the the productivity

00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:30,149
styles and in these emails we are having

00:24:26,729 --> 00:24:32,609
a convention to teach lemurs to code so

00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:35,190
a prioritize err might send an email

00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:36,869
that says the entire email we need an

00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,999
update on the venue for the lemur coding

00:24:36,869 --> 00:24:41,639
convention please send final event

00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:43,259
confirmation the prioritize er is the

00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:52,019
person who sends an email and you think

00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:55,519
they're mad at you next we have the

00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:58,049
planner overseeing all the other lemurs

00:24:55,519 --> 00:25:01,139
identifying a planner in the wild how

00:24:58,049 --> 00:25:03,959
many you came out as planners all right

00:25:01,139 --> 00:25:05,999
I'm a hybrid planner visualizer

00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:07,440
I have planner in my job title so it's

00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:10,379
it's good that I actually come out

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,549
partially being this planners tend to

00:25:10,379 --> 00:25:13,320
have a little bit more traditional

00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:15,139
spaces too they're on the neater side

00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:18,179
very big on putting things into folders

00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:19,709
if they have credentials or you know any

00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:21,389
kind of certificates they might display

00:25:19,709 --> 00:25:23,969
them in their their office or their

00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:26,789
workspace love schedules timelines

00:25:23,969 --> 00:25:28,529
getting straight to the point don't

00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:31,019
really like open-ended projects or

00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:33,959
open-ended questions really not a fan of

00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:35,579
waiting ass and disorganized meetings

00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:37,349
that don't follow an agenda and kind of

00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:39,899
go on and definitely drive them up the

00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:45,779
wall although that might be most people

00:25:39,899 --> 00:25:47,190
a planner lemur would send an email that

00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:48,899
says Sara

00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:50,609
we still need to confirm the venue for

00:25:48,899 --> 00:25:52,649
the lemur coding convention please send

00:25:50,609 --> 00:25:54,450
event date and time which rooms are

00:25:52,649 --> 00:25:56,609
reserved staff on duty for the event and

00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:59,099
any special terms we need this info by

00:25:56,609 --> 00:26:02,070
Friday at 2:00 p.m. for distribution on

00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:03,929
Monday at 10:00 a.m. thanks they'll

00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:05,820
usually include some kind of salutation

00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:06,839
their email through huge on bullets you

00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:10,679
can look at their emails and know

00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:13,679
exactly what they need I feel like was

00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:14,909
it Jennifer's talk earlier these emails

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,059
are right on point with the community

00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:20,509
organizing next up we have the arranger

00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:20,509
lemurs

00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:28,299
who's an arranger very people-focused

00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:30,070
alright the arrangers workspace tends to

00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:32,259
be a little bit more welcoming personal

00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:34,929
you'll have items from your trips or you

00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:36,519
know drawings that your kids or nieces

00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:37,960
or nephews or some other child in your

00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:40,240
life may do

00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:43,029
I arrange errs love storytelling they

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,190
really enjoy being appreciated they like

00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:47,129
long extended discussions and meetings

00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:49,509
they really like digging into topics

00:26:47,129 --> 00:26:50,649
they don't like it when people say that

00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:53,590
they need something from them

00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:55,869
immediately they really don't like ASAP

00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:57,999
they don't like by tomorrow at noon

00:26:55,869 --> 00:26:59,320
they're very big on asking who needs to

00:26:57,999 --> 00:27:03,730
be involved and why they need to be

00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:07,869
involved an arranger will send a really

00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:09,970
long email they will see see new people

00:27:07,869 --> 00:27:12,190
that probably didn't need to be there in

00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:15,879
the first place just so they feel

00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:20,730
included and they're really people

00:27:15,879 --> 00:27:23,289
focused so very kind big on you know

00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:25,299
opening emails with how people are doing

00:27:23,289 --> 00:27:28,659
closing them with hope you have a great

00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:34,499
day this dries prioritize errs up the

00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:37,749
wall and the visualizer up in the clouds

00:27:34,499 --> 00:27:39,820
tell me really loose associations but I

00:27:37,749 --> 00:27:43,600
love a lemur all right who are the

00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:45,700
visualizers all right so visualizers

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,710
your workspaces are probably on the

00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:50,110
informal side probably a little

00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:55,419
cluttered last time you cleaned off your

00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:56,740
desk might have been 2004 well tend to

00:27:55,419 --> 00:27:59,230
have really bright and playful

00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:01,299
workspaces they love thinking about the

00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:03,070
big pictures and conceptual frameworks

00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:06,490
they're they're big into white boards

00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:08,649
and post-its they can't stand repetition

00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:13,720
and they really hate the phrase but

00:28:08,649 --> 00:28:16,419
we've always done it this way the

00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:19,090
visualizer will send really long emails

00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:22,389
with run-on sentences and seemingly

00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:24,249
unrelated concepts eventually you might

00:28:22,389 --> 00:28:28,200
kind of get to what the visualizer was

00:28:24,249 --> 00:28:28,200
going for but it takes a while

00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:33,169
all right so why is it important to

00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:34,940
figure out what your productivity style

00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:37,429
is and the productivity styles of people

00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:39,710
around you well according to Carson tape

00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:41,360
engage productive employees do not work

00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:42,950
in a vacuum they need workplaces that

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,590
help them bring out the best of

00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:48,230
themselves mosh pits of creativity where

00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:49,610
energy and inspiration can flow freely I

00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:52,159
don't know how I feel about the mosh

00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:56,049
pits but it doesn't sound like any mosh

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:58,490
pit I have ever been in but you know

00:28:56,049 --> 00:29:00,500
Carson team I made frequent different

00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:02,419
concerts than I do all right

00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,620
so if you're working with a prioritize

00:29:02,419 --> 00:29:06,740
IRR if you have somebody on your team

00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:09,320
who's a prioritize IRR what are their

00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:11,360
strengths and how can you really tap

00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:14,059
into those well give them detailed data

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,130
oriented work give them all the

00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:18,260
spreadsheets if you need somebody to do

00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:20,720
analytics give it to the prioritized

00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,139
search right and how do you take care of

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,850
them

00:29:21,139 --> 00:29:25,010
let them opt out of meetings that don't

00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:27,169
don't need them they will not handle

00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:30,230
being in them wealth keep their tasks

00:29:27,169 --> 00:29:32,269
goal-oriented and provide facts when

00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:33,950
you're giving feedback you're if you're

00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:37,399
giving feedback to a prioritize IRR what

00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:38,779
they want to hear is this like we didn't

00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:41,299
get this thing in time

00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:42,769
therefore it resulted in a 40% drop in

00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:46,970
sales for this week that's what the

00:29:42,769 --> 00:29:49,460
prioritize IRR wants to know for the

00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:51,380
planner how can you live it to their

00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,700
strengths let them set agendas for

00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:55,549
meetings we'll be able to keep things

00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,710
tied into the project goals and get

00:29:55,549 --> 00:29:59,870
things set up so that everything comes

00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:02,059
in on deadline they'll probably also

00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:03,649
remind other team members if you need

00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:05,389
somebody to do that that something is

00:30:03,649 --> 00:30:07,220
behind on deadline

00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:10,250
and and you can really tap into that

00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:12,260
fondness for making sure that your

00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:14,779
planner has a happy healthy working

00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:17,360
environment ensure that they have space

00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:19,700
for filing and story that might seem a

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,320
little bit silly but just having

00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:24,529
dedicated places to put things is very

00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,610
important to a planner a place for

00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:28,909
everything and everything in its place

00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:31,100
kind of attitude give them deadlines and

00:30:28,909 --> 00:30:33,350
clear end points and when you're

00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,700
providing feedback to a planner they are

00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:36,679
probably going to take a little bit

00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,840
cautiously they're gonna want to go home

00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:41,799
and Bowl on it a little bit but they

00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,799
will be receptive to feedback

00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:49,399
for the arranger the arranger is going

00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:52,249
to have great insights on you know what

00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:53,749
the team feels and who's going to like

00:30:52,249 --> 00:30:55,549
certain things and who's not going to

00:30:53,749 --> 00:30:57,379
like certain things that's something

00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:59,539
that can really really be useful to you

00:30:57,379 --> 00:31:01,309
you can also allowed them to lead

00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:02,629
extended discussions because the

00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:04,700
arranger is very good at making sure

00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:06,980
people feel heard if you need somebody

00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,539
to persuade someone of something

00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:11,539
the arranger is gonna be a good person

00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:14,480
for that and to take care of your

00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:17,179
arrangers this seems obvious but let

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,580
them work with other people putting an

00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:21,289
arranger by themselves in a room and

00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:24,169
saying alright work independently for

00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:26,359
the next 40 hours is not going to play

00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:28,580
well with them also allow them some

00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:30,019
space for some personal items they're

00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,090
probably going to have an emotional

00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:35,690
response to feedback that doesn't mean

00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:37,789
don't give people feedback just be aware

00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:41,450
and kind about it before you give an

00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:44,239
arranger feedback and for the

00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:46,429
visualizers how to tap into their

00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:49,659
strengths if you need somebody to id8

00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:53,869
which is a word I feel ambivalent

00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:55,519
ambivalently about existing but if you

00:31:53,869 --> 00:31:57,859
need somebody to you know draw on a

00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,809
whiteboard or read a brainstorming

00:31:57,859 --> 00:32:02,059
session the visualizer is your person

00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:04,369
for that they like lots of light and

00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:05,989
informal spaces to do their work in you

00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:07,460
hand them a pack of sharpies and bright

00:32:05,989 --> 00:32:12,399
post-its we'll be really thrilled with

00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:12,399
you and they can go anyway with feedback

00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:23,239
all right so how are you doing on time

00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:26,600
why thank you timekeeper for turning

00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:29,179
that over what I'm gonna have everybody

00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,730
do is take again two minutes because

00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:34,609
we're almost at the end turn to your

00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:36,499
neighbor ask about the result and ask if

00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:38,509
how they would like their co-workers to

00:32:36,499 --> 00:32:42,499
support them in in their productivity

00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:44,119
style first of all thanks everybody for

00:32:42,499 --> 00:32:46,340
for playing along with talking to each

00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:48,710
other I am so much of a rebel that I had

00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:51,399
no idea if anybody was actually going to

00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:51,399
speak to each other

00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:56,690
so bringing all that together right the

00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:59,450
the point that I'm trying to drive home

00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:01,159
today is that you can work really well

00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:03,289
and really collaboratively with people

00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:04,669
around you if you practice at it and pay

00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:07,460
attention to what those people need

00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:09,379
right so you might have started out

00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,940
accidentally in a leadership position or

00:33:09,379 --> 00:33:14,179
not have a lot of experience working

00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:17,269
with other people directly but if you

00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:17,960
practice regularly you can go from that

00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:21,769
ridiculous

00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,090
penguin airplane that I drew earlier to

00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:26,779
something that actually looks like a

00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:27,559
thing that was after about three weeks

00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:29,749
right

00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:33,529
practice is fantastic an intentional

00:33:29,749 --> 00:33:36,799
regular practice is even better so thank

00:33:33,529 --> 00:33:38,869
