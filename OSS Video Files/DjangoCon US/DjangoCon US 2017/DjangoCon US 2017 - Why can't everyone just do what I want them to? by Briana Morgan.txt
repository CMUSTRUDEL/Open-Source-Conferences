	DjangoCon US 2017 - Why can't everyone just do what I want them to? Leadership, management, and working with people who don't think like you by Briana Morgan

Do you pride yourself on your post-it and Sharpie collection? Do you set appointments for yourself in your own calendar - that you actually show up for? Do you write to-do lists on your hand, since youâ€™ll forget if the to-do isnâ€™t right in front of your face? Do you own - and use - a label maker? Do you hate New Yearâ€™s resolutions because the whole idea of starting new habits on January 1 is an artificial construct?

People are weird. We all have some pretty particular ways we think, work, and get motivated. Itâ€™s hard enough when weâ€™re just trying to focus on ourselves, but it gets even more complicated when we add other people to the mix. What happens when a whiteboard person has to work with a spreadsheet person - or even harder, lead a whole team of spreadsheet people?

This talk will focus on practical tips for working better with others - especially when youâ€™re in a leadership or management position, although we all lead in different ways. Weâ€™ll start off with an overview of productivity and motivational styles, identifying how they influence the way we all think and work. Then, weâ€™ll pinpoint how our own personal productivity and motivational styles impact us and those around us. After that, weâ€™ll figure out how to look for clues about our colleaguesâ€™ working styles. Finally, weâ€™ll talk about strategies for bridging our working styles with those of the people around us. Youâ€™ll leave with insights about what makes you tick, plus actionable tools to improve your leadership skills and enhance your working relationships.
