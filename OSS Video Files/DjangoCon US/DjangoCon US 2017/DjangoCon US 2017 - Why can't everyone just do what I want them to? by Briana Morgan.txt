	DjangoCon US 2017 - Why can't everyone just do what I want them to? Leadership, management, and working with people who don't think like you by Briana Morgan

Do you pride yourself on your post-it and Sharpie collection? Do you set appointments for yourself in your own calendar - that you actually show up for? Do you write to-do lists on your hand, since youâ€™ll forget if the to-do isnâ€™t right in front of your face? Do you own - and use - a label maker? Do you hate New Yearâ€™s resolutions because the whole idea of starting new habits on January 1 is an artificial construct?

People are weird. We all have some pretty particular ways we think, work, and get motivated. Itâ€™s hard enough when weâ€™re just trying to focus on ourselves, but it gets even more complicated when we add other people to the mix. What happens when a whiteboard person has to work with a spreadsheet person - or even harder, lead a whole team of spreadsheet people?

This talk will focus on practical tips for working better with others - especially when youâ€™re in a leadership or management position, although we all lead in different ways. Weâ€™ll start off with an overview of productivity and motivational styles, identifying how they influence the way we all think and work. Then, weâ€™ll pinpoint how our own personal productivity and motivational styles impact us and those around us. After that, weâ€™ll figure out how to look for clues about our colleaguesâ€™ working styles. Finally, weâ€™ll talk about strategies for bridging our working styles with those of the people around us. Youâ€™ll leave with insights about what makes you tick, plus actionable tools to improve your leadership skills and enhance your working relationships.

[Music]

00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:20,880
hi everybody

00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,439
so the question on everyone's minds why

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,020
can't everyone just do what I want them

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,180
to leadership management and working

00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,850
with people who don't think like you

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,090
which is probably just about everyone on

00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:35,309
the planet so we're gonna start with a

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,980
seemingly unrelated story that has

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:39,839
nothing to do with anything a few months

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,359
ago I decided to participate in

00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:45,089
something called the hundred day project

00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:48,179
the hundred day project is run by Al

00:00:45,089 --> 00:00:50,819
Luna who does a talk and has written a

00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:53,639
book about the crossroads of should and

00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:56,429
must the idea is that for a hundred days

00:00:53,639 --> 00:00:59,219
you did something creative same thing

00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:03,179
every single day took a picture of it

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,830
and post it on Instagram I decided I

00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:06,540
want to learn how to draw I've never

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,670
been good at it my mom's great at

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,110
drawing she's great at painting the

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,140
problem is when you decide to learn

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:16,140
something new as an adult you feel

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,150
really dumb and really clumsy those of

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,600
you who loon who learned to code as an

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:24,330
adult probably have experienced this so

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,940
I'm going to show you for some reason

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,380
the very first drawing I did in the

00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:34,610
drawing assessment as they learned to

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:34,610
draw any guesses as to what this is

00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:42,960
shark is close but it wasn't in fact an

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,270
airplane it's a terrible airplane but

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,860
but one thing that you get from trying

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:51,330
to do something new as an adult is a

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:53,430
very strong sense of humility and that's

00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:55,320
kind of what I want to talk about today

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,909
learning a lot about yourself so you can

00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,700
apply that to the people to the

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,590
relationships with the people around you

00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:04,590
how many people in here became a leader

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,970
by accident like you didn't really mean

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,250
to and then all of a sudden you were in

00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,629
charge of a committee or something and

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,659
then you're looking around lay on out

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:14,099
the hands are still going up like what

00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:15,930
am I gonna do this

00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:17,790
yeah working with people is a skill

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,720
that's separate from anything else that

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,520
we do in our job

00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,770
and that kind of gets back to what Laci

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,230
was saying yesterday about what it is to

00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,330
have a soft stalkers as a technical talk

00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:33,280
when realistically we're working with

00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:35,650
people all the time so Who am I and why

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,620
am i doing this talk I am Brianna Morgan

00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:40,930
I work in public health full time I also

00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,730
do some digital strategy I'm the

00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,040
president of the Philadelphia area new

00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:47,470
media Association I'm a co-organizer of

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,990
BarCamp Philly which is about to be in

00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:52,000
its tenth year I do marketing for an

00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:54,790
intentional living app called and

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,670
tired-out life I make poor drawings of

00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,260
airplanes and I spend a lot of time

00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:02,440
working with different types of people

00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:05,380
so what we're gonna do today we're gonna

00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,690
start off with an overview of habit

00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,980
formation tendencies I'll explain that

00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,630
in in a second

00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,550
there's gonna be a self-assessment

00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,260
component and then there's going to be a

00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,270
short exercise and reflection on that

00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,850
then we're gonna repeat that with

00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:22,030
productivity styles and then we'll have

00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:24,130
a conclusion so you're going to need for

00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,830
this talk you're either your Notes app

00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,730
or a pen and paper or whatever you have

00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,990
because at some point there's going to

00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,390
be a bit of a quiz and you're gonna need

00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:34,020
to write your answers down we're gonna

00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:36,160
spend most of our time on ourselves and

00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,990
then we're going to apply the lessons

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,670
that we learn from that to the people

00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:42,370
around us you'll get some specific

00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:45,850
strategies and tips for recognizing

00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,050
behaviors and other people and one thing

00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,460
that's important to remember that

00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,960
despite the fact that we're gonna spend

00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,060
a lot of our time thinking about

00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,680
ourselves that not everything is about

00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,750
you and the way that people interact

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,270
with you is more about them that it is

00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,040
about you and so that's why there's this

00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:04,390
really strong component of figuring out

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:06,450
how you interact with other people all

00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,920
right so why are we starting with habits

00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:11,050
for one habits are stronger than reason

00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:15,130
there is a paper out of Duke University

00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:17,200
in about 2006 that identified that forty

00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,390
to forty five percent of the behaviors

00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,030
that we repeat every day are based in

00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,710
habits so the way that you form habits

00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,120
has really important implications for

00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:28,210
how you work and really important

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,560
implications for how your team works so

00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,550
the framework we're going to use here is

00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,320
Gretchen Reubens for tendency

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:36,710
this is based on a book that she wrote

00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,570
called better than before and she's

00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,640
going to actually be releasing a whole

00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,070
new book entirely on the fore tendency

00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,510
is because it was such a popular idea

00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:49,070
it's based on whether you're internally

00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:51,460
motivated or externally motivated so our

00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:53,720
first personality type is the upholder

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,730
these are the people that you can rely

00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,100
on for absolutely everything they're

00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:00,830
motivated by internal expectations and

00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,510
external expectations there are the

00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,400
people who can tell themselves we're

00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:07,370
going to get up tomorrow at 5:30 and go

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,960
on a run and they'll do it and they'll

00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,640
go to work and do everything they said

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,560
they'd do at work and then they'll meet

00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,690
their friends for dinner at 7 o'clock at

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,100
night and then show somebody around town

00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:20,540
at 9:00 because they said they would do

00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:22,850
all those things the next type is the

00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:25,250
questioner the questioner is usually

00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,320
internally motivated but it can be

00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,070
externally motivated if there's a good

00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,320
reason for it

00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,820
they'll go for a run at 5:30 in the

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,520
morning because somebody said running is

00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:36,350
a good idea for them but only after they

00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,390
research why running at 5:30 in the

00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,950
morning is a good idea for them they're

00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:44,690
also the people who ask questions all

00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:45,860
throughout your team meetings the

00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,620
obligors are the people who are

00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,060
motivated by what other people want

00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,920
they'll get up at 5:30 to go for a run

00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:56,930
if you have a friend that they're gonna

00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:59,750
wet down if they don't show up and the

00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:02,330
fourth tendency is the rebel the rebel

00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:04,220
accepts no expectations of any kind from

00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,900
anyone you'll never see them running

00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,160
around at 5:30 in the morning because

00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,910
they don't want you to tell them what to

00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:13,550
do I I personally am a rebel it's a

00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:15,140
pretty rare personality type I don't

00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:19,220
really wish it upon other people because

00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:22,490
it's pretty difficult to manage recently

00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:26,150
I attended an open mic with my boyfriend

00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:27,920
there was a section where there the

00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:30,020
artists asked people to clap and stomp

00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,250
along to the song which is a pretty

00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,280
normal thing to do when you see a

00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:36,860
musical performance but we sat there for

00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,300
the song I clapped and stomped along for

00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,800
maybe half of a verse he did it the

00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,290
whole time and at the end he leaned over

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,850
he said you know I always did musical

00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,889
theater so I always play along with

00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,379
audience participation

00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:49,710
when people ask me to I looked him and I

00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:51,969
was like yeah I was in theater too but

00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:55,719
man I hate it when people tell me what

00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:59,490
to do so I'll be nice and to it for a

00:06:55,719 --> 00:07:03,689
little bit you know for appearances but

00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:06,129
so with that we're going to do a brief

00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:08,169
truncated version of the assessment on

00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:09,789
the four different personality types to

00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:10,779
kind of figure out where you fall and

00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:12,249
then we're going to talk about what that

00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:14,259
means for you and what it means for the

00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:15,900
people around you so this is going to be

00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:18,969
six questions it's a multiple-choice

00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:21,009
ABCD so you know if you're the person

00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:22,870
who's really into having the right thing

00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:28,389
done you can number your paper down the

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:31,870
left side 1 2 3 4 5 6 so question number

00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:34,110
one do you keep New Year's resolutions

00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:37,089
if your aren't accountable to anyone a

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:39,909
yes I'm good at keeping resolutions even

00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:41,770
ones that no one knows about but me B

00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:43,259
I'm good at keeping resolutions but I

00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:47,529
make them whenever it seems right

00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:49,569
January 1st is an arbitrary date see I

00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:51,370
don't usually make resolutions like that

00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:53,289
when I'm only helping myself I often

00:07:51,370 --> 00:08:01,569
struggle or do you know I hate

00:07:53,289 --> 00:08:03,789
restricting myself right - are you most

00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:05,649
likely to frustrate yourself because a I

00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:07,740
can't take a break from my usual habits

00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:10,029
or break the rules even when I want to

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:13,120
be my constant need for information

00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:14,770
exhausts me see I can take time for

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,219
other people but I can't take time for

00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:25,029
myself D as soon as I'm expected to do

00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:26,800
something I don't want to do it 3 what

00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:29,169
best describes review about your

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,879
commitments to yourself I take my

00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:33,550
commitments to myself as seriously as

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,469
take commitments to other people B I

00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:37,959
only make commitments to myself if it

00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:39,490
really makes sense to see if someone

00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:40,899
else is holding me accountable for my

00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:43,120
commitments I'll meet them but I

00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:46,649
struggle if only I know or D I bind

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,649
myself as little as possible

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,680
for when you've formed a healthy habit

00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,389
in the past what helped it stick hey I'm

00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,290
good at sticking to habits even when no

00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:06,240
one else cares be doing a lot of

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:10,439
research and customization about why and

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,120
how I might keep that habit see I could

00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:15,060
stick to a good habit only when I was

00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:19,250
answerable to someone else or D I don't

00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,250
usually choose to bind myself in advance

00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,939
five if people complain about your

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,920
behavior you'd be least surprised to

00:09:26,939 --> 00:09:31,350
hear and some of you may have heard some

00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,120
of these things before and you stick to

00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,540
your habits even when it's inconvenient

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,550
for other people B you ask way too many

00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,230
questions

00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:41,910
C you're good at taking time for others

00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:45,029
but you're not good at taking time for

00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:51,569
yourself or do you only do what you want

00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:54,240
to do when you want to do it and the

00:09:51,569 --> 00:09:58,709
final one six which description suits

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,870
you best a disciplined even when it

00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:05,160
doesn't make sense

00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:07,319
B asks necessary questions C puts others

00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:16,199
clients family friends co-workers first

00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:18,480
or D refuses to be bossed by others so

00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:20,699
if this isn't wildly obvious a was the

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,209
upholder the people who meet internal

00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:26,629
and external expectations if you have

00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:29,370
mostly B's you're probably a questioner

00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:33,300
if you have mostly C's you're an obligor

00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:36,889
if you have mostly DS or a rebel so how

00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,889
many people came out as upholders

00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:43,339
excellent how about questioners B's

00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:48,050
alright obligers C's

00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:59,810
and rebels sorry guys I I did Oh also

00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:01,190
are there any people who came out as a

00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:06,830
rebel but didn't raise your hand because

00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:09,410
I asked you to all right so I did a

00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:11,150
super super formal assessment this way

00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:13,760
among forty-four of my Facebook friends

00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:16,490
who happen to be around at the time of

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,810
the 44:25 war obligers and 15 were

00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:20,660
questioners which are the two most

00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:24,080
common habit formation types I got three

00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,870
rebels which is the rarest and by the

00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:30,140
way this is not like a statistically

00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:32,570
valid in any way sample and I got one

00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:34,670
upholder and I my my theory on that is

00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:36,290
that upholders aren't sitting around on

00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:43,790
Facebook taking quizzes that their

00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:45,560
friends post alright so this is a quote

00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,120
from Gretchen Rubin who came up with

00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,010
this four tendencies framework in the

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,450
first place

00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,920
we won't make ourselves more creative

00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:55,070
and productive by copying other people's

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,110
habits even the habits of geniuses we

00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:59,600
must know our own nature and what habits

00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,860
serve us best right so I mean we're all

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,680
people with the Internet we've seen

00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,420
medium articles right how many

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,950
productivity hacks have you seen that

00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,530
would never in a million years work for

00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:11,750
you or the way you think and so we're

00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:12,440
gonna we're gonna do this by personality

00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,620
type

00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,420
so the upholders what's the perk of

00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,950
being an upholder you're capable of

00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,690
working independently and you're highly

00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,980
motivated by to-do list you can get

00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,480
things done without a whole lot of

00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,850
oversight and that's a great thing that

00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,920
you can have in a team member the

00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:30,610
problem is that you can often wind up on

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,480
a never-ending quest for gold stars

00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:34,310
constantly trying to get to the next

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,160
accomplishment always doing the next

00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:39,170
thing another issue that might have some

00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,090
upholders is there a completely baffled

00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:42,830
by people who struggle with things if

00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:45,200
you've ever had a boss or a co-worker

00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:47,270
who says something like I don't know why

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,460
they can't just get it done we told them

00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:53,870
it needed to be done

00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:55,399
maybe you've said that yourself so

00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,870
strategies for upholders they're

00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,430
naturally good at habit so if you're

00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:01,399
working with somebody who's an upholder

00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:02,690
you're you're in luck one way if you

00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:04,250
have an upholder that's trying to

00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:06,050
perform better at work you can get them

00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,850
to track or monitor their current

00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,410
behaviors that's something that works

00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:12,560
really well for them like doing time

00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:14,360
logs any kind of scheduling an upholder

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,760
does tend to do really well with

00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,920
blocking out calendar time for for doing

00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,930
specific tasks they also work really

00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,839
well with clearly defined rules so if

00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:25,880
you're supervising an upholder and you

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,589
can clearly outline exactly what they're

00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,700
supposed to be doing that works really

00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:30,080
well for them they just want to know

00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:34,089
what the expectations are they'll meet

00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:36,470
them on their own questioners

00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:38,630
questioners it turns out really hate

00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,459
waiting in line they don't seem to

00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:43,279
understand why lines exist or why they

00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:45,770
have to stand in them they are motivated

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,970
by logic and reasoning and are very good

00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:50,660
at doing things that they've already

00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:53,029
decided to do you do have to get them

00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,470
there so when you're working with the

00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:56,120
questionnaire you need to be prepared to

00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,709
answer whatever questions they might

00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,180
have and they will have a lot of why

00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:00,770
questions you know the thing where you

00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,650
hang out with the toddler and the

00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:06,650
toddler ask why why why some people are

00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:08,750
just always like that so keep an eye out

00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:10,640
for that there can be some tension about

00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:13,970
them always asking questions and

00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:16,430
meetings just never-ending parade of

00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:18,410
wise and the questioners also have a

00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:24,410
hard time making choices if they don't

00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:25,940
have a complete set of information so in

00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:28,310
terms of habit strategies for

00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:30,200
questioners questioners

00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:32,450
really want to understand why something

00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,339
exists why is this process this way why

00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:35,750
are we looping this person in why why do

00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:37,160
we have to do why do we have to build

00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,410
this thing at all

00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,060
so be clear about what you're trying to

00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,860
do clarity is a strategy that works

00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,660
really wonderfully for questioners and

00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,630
the other thing that works great with

00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:51,589
questioners is identifying any loopholes

00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:53,300
in advance right so if you know that if

00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:55,040
if you're a questioner trying to

00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,620
establish a new habit and you know that

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,970
you're prone to saying oh well I'll do

00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:02,600
the thing I was supposed to do tomorrow

00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:05,000
because I'll still do it just not now

00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,339
you can kind of plan around that or the

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,420
whole like oh well I'll just work on

00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:11,420
this thing that's not the highest

00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:14,709
priority because I feel like it but

00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:16,850
tomorrow tomorrow we'll do it

00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:18,829
obligers are great team players but

00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:21,019
they're prone to burnout the obligors

00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:22,399
are the people who will if they need if

00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:24,500
you need somebody to do something on a

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,990
team they will jump up and do it if you

00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,250
send them a slack message at 12:30 in

00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,560
the morning they will get up and take

00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:34,670
care of the thing the problem is they

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:38,630
that's exhausting and you can only tap

00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:40,519
into that for so long for our blinders

00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:43,430
they do really want accountability

00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:44,329
regular meetings if you're supervising

00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,699
an obligor

00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:48,949
then meeting with them maybe once or

00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:50,240
twice a week so that they are

00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:51,949
accountable for doing the things that

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,990
they said they were gonna do they also

00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:59,660
do it really well with habit tracking

00:15:53,990 --> 00:16:02,839
with any partners and rebels are great

00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:05,360
at coming up with new ideas they often

00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:07,100
will only come up with new ideas but

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,000
they're also willing to take risks risks

00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:13,699
you got to watch out there they're

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:20,779
oppositional in terms of habit

00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:22,610
strategies for rebels good luck it's the

00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:25,040
thing that's worked for me as a rebel I

00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:26,720
can say is to create a situation in

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,970
which making the choice that I want to

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,290
make is a little bit easier and in

00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,389
public health terms we call this a

00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:34,910
structural intervention it's the idea of

00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:36,889
if you're trying to eat better than take

00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,209
the potato chips out of your house so

00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:39,529
you can still have the dealerships if

00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:40,670
you want them but you have to drive down

00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:43,579
the street to get them and it's much

00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:47,060
harder you can also tie habits to

00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:49,569
identity it reminds me a lot of Seth

00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:52,550
Godin and the marketer talks a lot about

00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:55,490
identifying you know people like us do

00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:58,310
things like this and you can do that for

00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:00,410
ruble habit tendencies as well right the

00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:04,250
idea is people like me do things like

00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:06,380
this I'm the kind of person who goes

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:11,959
home and studies every day and then

00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:13,520
unties the habit to that alright so what

00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:14,790
I would like you to do now is very

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,670
briefly in

00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:21,630
two minutes turn to somebody near you

00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:23,910
and ask how they're asked for what the

00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:26,370
result was and what the last habit was

00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:30,330
that they tried to form and whether or

00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:32,730
not it worked this is amazing

00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:34,500
all right so it sounded like people are

00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:37,550
having some pretty robust conversations

00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:40,500
and just have keep a little note

00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:43,320
mentally of what you learned from your

00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,270
conversation with your new neighbors we

00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:50,010
are going to move into productivity

00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:52,710
styles this comes from Carson Tate's

00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:56,490
book work simply and again we're going

00:17:52,710 --> 00:18:00,360
to be doing a truncated assessment the

00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:02,160
first style is prioritize er prioritize

00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,870
errs and people who always know what's

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,730
next they are ruthless

00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:07,470
they love spreadsheets they probably

00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:12,810
loved kodos talk on spreadsheets

00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:15,870
yesterday next up is the planner the

00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:21,480
planner is huge on deadlines you will

00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:23,310
commonly find them in Trello the third

00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,410
is the arranger the Ranger is very

00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:30,360
people centered there are often making

00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:32,640
introductions and the fourth is the

00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,680
vigil visualizer the visualizer is a big

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:39,180
picture person they are very idea

00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:40,440
focused right so this assessment is

00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,360
gonna work a little bit differently

00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,490
we're gonna have four sets of four

00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,430
questions you're gonna rate yourself on

00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:49,080
a scale of one to five which is on the

00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,940
slide so you'll know what it is one is

00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:54,810
this never applies to you and five is

00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:59,790
yeah that's that's me you know that so

00:18:54,810 --> 00:19:04,650
questions at one 1a I use a prioritized

00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:09,750
list to complete my work one is never

00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:12,810
three is sometimes five is always one B

00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:15,620
I designate specific time periods for

00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,620
certain tasks

00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:25,429
one see it is hard for me to take time

00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:25,429
to play while there's still work to do

00:19:27,349 --> 00:19:34,129
one D when I plan a project I think

00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:34,129
about the project goals first

00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:56,560
set to to a I am often late

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:59,160
one never five always six if you're not

00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,160
in the room yet

00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:13,300
to be daydreaming gives me insights and

00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:19,240
solutions to big problems to see I

00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:21,730
complete my best work under pressure to

00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:28,720
D when I brainstorm I sketch or draw my

00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:32,340
ideas anybody was in Melanie's talk

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,340
earlier I feel like that applies to her

00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:42,820
question set three again one is never

00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:50,320
five as always 3a I have trouble telling

00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:53,370
my colleagues no 3b I blocked time on my

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,370
calendar to complete my work

00:20:54,330 --> 00:21:03,610
3c I tend to underestimate how long it

00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:06,010
takes to complete tasks and projects 3d

00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:10,320
I am selective about the tools like pens

00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:10,320
paper folders etc that you use

00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:31,630
final set of questions for a I plan for

00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:36,429
the next day for B I use a deadline as a

00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:38,740
time frame for completion for C I

00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:43,660
eliminate the physical clutter in my

00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:46,980
office and for D a complete project

00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,980
tasks in sequential order

00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:56,450
all right so when you're done with that

00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:58,399
what you want to do is add your total up

00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:03,739
for each section and figure out which

00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:07,009
one is the the biggest number it might

00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:08,599
be close you might have some ties these

00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:10,669
aren't really mutually exclusive the way

00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:16,460
that the habit formation tendencies can

00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:19,009
be so if your highest number was in the

00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:22,759
first set of questions you are primarily

00:22:19,009 --> 00:22:26,359
a prioritize er if it was number two

00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:29,720
you're mostly a visualizer it was number

00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:33,489
three you're primarily an arranger and

00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:38,359
if your highest number was number four

00:22:33,489 --> 00:22:40,789
then you're a planner so before we go on

00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:45,470
with this because this is a hot topic in

00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:49,159
the workplaces your way of doing things

00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:51,349
is not the best way of doing things if

00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:54,349
you are lucky your way of doing things

00:22:51,349 --> 00:22:58,489
is the best way for you to do things and

00:22:54,349 --> 00:22:59,840
it's probably not even that all right so

00:22:58,489 --> 00:23:01,519
now we're gonna have some pictures of

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,220
lemurs because I felt like including

00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:06,019
pictures of lemurs in my slides lemurs

00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,279
are one of my favorite animals and last

00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:13,099
year I got to go to the Duke lemur

00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:17,179
center Adrienne also loves weavers all

00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:19,609
right so this is our first lemur this is

00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:24,229
the prioritize er because they're third

00:23:19,609 --> 00:23:26,029
they're ranked lemurs this this is I

00:23:24,229 --> 00:23:27,229
know I'm trying really hard and reaching

00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:31,820
for this one but I really want to have

00:23:27,229 --> 00:23:34,309
lemurs alright so how to identify a

00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:37,460
prioritize er in the wild how many of

00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:39,889
you came out as prioritize errs and all

00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,720
right so prioritize errs tend to have a

00:23:39,889 --> 00:23:43,759
little bit more of tradition traditional

00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,950
spaces that they work in not a lot of

00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:48,019
excess their desk is mostly going to

00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:49,549
have their current work on it tend to

00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:51,799
get distracted by having lots of other

00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:53,720
things around again this is not always a

00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:56,269
hundred percent true but this is where

00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,729
you kind of thrive prioritize errs love

00:23:56,269 --> 00:24:01,029
data and debate the big fans of the

00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:03,499
phrase work smarter not harder

00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:05,669
they hate hanging around and just

00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:08,329
talking for no reason

00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:11,039
it's like small talk is not their thing

00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:12,839
vague directions any long extended

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,719
emotional reactions to anything

00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:19,559
especially in a business context not a

00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:22,440
fan of that either I wrote up sample

00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:26,729
emails for each of the the productivity

00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:30,149
styles and in these emails we are having

00:24:26,729 --> 00:24:32,609
a convention to teach lemurs to code so

00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:35,190
a prioritize err might send an email

00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:36,869
that says the entire email we need an

00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,999
update on the venue for the lemur coding

00:24:36,869 --> 00:24:41,639
convention please send final event

00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:43,259
confirmation the prioritize er is the

00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:52,019
person who sends an email and you think

00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:55,519
they're mad at you next we have the

00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:58,049
planner overseeing all the other lemurs

00:24:55,519 --> 00:25:01,139
identifying a planner in the wild how

00:24:58,049 --> 00:25:03,959
many you came out as planners all right

00:25:01,139 --> 00:25:05,999
I'm a hybrid planner visualizer

00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:07,440
I have planner in my job title so it's

00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:10,379
it's good that I actually come out

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,549
partially being this planners tend to

00:25:10,379 --> 00:25:13,320
have a little bit more traditional

00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:15,139
spaces too they're on the neater side

00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:18,179
very big on putting things into folders

00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:19,709
if they have credentials or you know any

00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:21,389
kind of certificates they might display

00:25:19,709 --> 00:25:23,969
them in their their office or their

00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:26,789
workspace love schedules timelines

00:25:23,969 --> 00:25:28,529
getting straight to the point don't

00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:31,019
really like open-ended projects or

00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:33,959
open-ended questions really not a fan of

00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:35,579
waiting ass and disorganized meetings

00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:37,349
that don't follow an agenda and kind of

00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:39,899
go on and definitely drive them up the

00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:45,779
wall although that might be most people

00:25:39,899 --> 00:25:47,190
a planner lemur would send an email that

00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:48,899
says Sara

00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:50,609
we still need to confirm the venue for

00:25:48,899 --> 00:25:52,649
the lemur coding convention please send

00:25:50,609 --> 00:25:54,450
event date and time which rooms are

00:25:52,649 --> 00:25:56,609
reserved staff on duty for the event and

00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:59,099
any special terms we need this info by

00:25:56,609 --> 00:26:02,070
Friday at 2:00 p.m. for distribution on

00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:03,929
Monday at 10:00 a.m. thanks they'll

00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:05,820
usually include some kind of salutation

00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:06,839
their email through huge on bullets you

00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:10,679
can look at their emails and know

00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:13,679
exactly what they need I feel like was

00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:14,909
it Jennifer's talk earlier these emails

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,059
are right on point with the community

00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:20,509
organizing next up we have the arranger

00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:20,509
lemurs

00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:28,299
who's an arranger very people-focused

00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:30,070
alright the arrangers workspace tends to

00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:32,259
be a little bit more welcoming personal

00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:34,929
you'll have items from your trips or you

00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:36,519
know drawings that your kids or nieces

00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:37,960
or nephews or some other child in your

00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:40,240
life may do

00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:43,029
I arrange errs love storytelling they

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,190
really enjoy being appreciated they like

00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:47,129
long extended discussions and meetings

00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:49,509
they really like digging into topics

00:26:47,129 --> 00:26:50,649
they don't like it when people say that

00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:53,590
they need something from them

00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:55,869
immediately they really don't like ASAP

00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:57,999
they don't like by tomorrow at noon

00:26:55,869 --> 00:26:59,320
they're very big on asking who needs to

00:26:57,999 --> 00:27:03,730
be involved and why they need to be

00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:07,869
involved an arranger will send a really

00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:09,970
long email they will see see new people

00:27:07,869 --> 00:27:12,190
that probably didn't need to be there in

00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:15,879
the first place just so they feel

00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:20,730
included and they're really people

00:27:15,879 --> 00:27:23,289
focused so very kind big on you know

00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:25,299
opening emails with how people are doing

00:27:23,289 --> 00:27:28,659
closing them with hope you have a great

00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:34,499
day this dries prioritize errs up the

00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:37,749
wall and the visualizer up in the clouds

00:27:34,499 --> 00:27:39,820
tell me really loose associations but I

00:27:37,749 --> 00:27:43,600
love a lemur all right who are the

00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:45,700
visualizers all right so visualizers

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,710
your workspaces are probably on the

00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:50,110
informal side probably a little

00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:55,419
cluttered last time you cleaned off your

00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:56,740
desk might have been 2004 well tend to

00:27:55,419 --> 00:27:59,230
have really bright and playful

00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:01,299
workspaces they love thinking about the

00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:03,070
big pictures and conceptual frameworks

00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:06,490
they're they're big into white boards

00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:08,649
and post-its they can't stand repetition

00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:13,720
and they really hate the phrase but

00:28:08,649 --> 00:28:16,419
we've always done it this way the

00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:19,090
visualizer will send really long emails

00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:22,389
with run-on sentences and seemingly

00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:24,249
unrelated concepts eventually you might

00:28:22,389 --> 00:28:28,200
kind of get to what the visualizer was

00:28:24,249 --> 00:28:28,200
going for but it takes a while

00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:33,169
all right so why is it important to

00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:34,940
figure out what your productivity style

00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:37,429
is and the productivity styles of people

00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:39,710
around you well according to Carson tape

00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:41,360
engage productive employees do not work

00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:42,950
in a vacuum they need workplaces that

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,590
help them bring out the best of

00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:48,230
themselves mosh pits of creativity where

00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:49,610
energy and inspiration can flow freely I

00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:52,159
don't know how I feel about the mosh

00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:56,049
pits but it doesn't sound like any mosh

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:58,490
pit I have ever been in but you know

00:28:56,049 --> 00:29:00,500
Carson team I made frequent different

00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:02,419
concerts than I do all right

00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,620
so if you're working with a prioritize

00:29:02,419 --> 00:29:06,740
IRR if you have somebody on your team

00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:09,320
who's a prioritize IRR what are their

00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:11,360
strengths and how can you really tap

00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:14,059
into those well give them detailed data

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,130
oriented work give them all the

00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:18,260
spreadsheets if you need somebody to do

00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:20,720
analytics give it to the prioritized

00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,139
search right and how do you take care of

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,850
them

00:29:21,139 --> 00:29:25,010
let them opt out of meetings that don't

00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:27,169
don't need them they will not handle

00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:30,230
being in them wealth keep their tasks

00:29:27,169 --> 00:29:32,269
goal-oriented and provide facts when

00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:33,950
you're giving feedback you're if you're

00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:37,399
giving feedback to a prioritize IRR what

00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:38,779
they want to hear is this like we didn't

00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:41,299
get this thing in time

00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:42,769
therefore it resulted in a 40% drop in

00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:46,970
sales for this week that's what the

00:29:42,769 --> 00:29:49,460
prioritize IRR wants to know for the

00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:51,380
planner how can you live it to their

00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,700
strengths let them set agendas for

00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:55,549
meetings we'll be able to keep things

00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,710
tied into the project goals and get

00:29:55,549 --> 00:29:59,870
things set up so that everything comes

00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:02,059
in on deadline they'll probably also

00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:03,649
remind other team members if you need

00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:05,389
somebody to do that that something is

00:30:03,649 --> 00:30:07,220
behind on deadline

00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:10,250
and and you can really tap into that

00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:12,260
fondness for making sure that your

00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:14,779
planner has a happy healthy working

00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:17,360
environment ensure that they have space

00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:19,700
for filing and story that might seem a

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,320
little bit silly but just having

00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:24,529
dedicated places to put things is very

00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,610
important to a planner a place for

00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:28,909
everything and everything in its place

00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:31,100
kind of attitude give them deadlines and

00:30:28,909 --> 00:30:33,350
clear end points and when you're

00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,700
providing feedback to a planner they are

00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:36,679
probably going to take a little bit

00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,840
cautiously they're gonna want to go home

00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:41,799
and Bowl on it a little bit but they

00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,799
will be receptive to feedback

00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:49,399
for the arranger the arranger is going

00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:52,249
to have great insights on you know what

00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:53,749
the team feels and who's going to like

00:30:52,249 --> 00:30:55,549
certain things and who's not going to

00:30:53,749 --> 00:30:57,379
like certain things that's something

00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:59,539
that can really really be useful to you

00:30:57,379 --> 00:31:01,309
you can also allowed them to lead

00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:02,629
extended discussions because the

00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:04,700
arranger is very good at making sure

00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:06,980
people feel heard if you need somebody

00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,539
to persuade someone of something

00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:11,539
the arranger is gonna be a good person

00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:14,480
for that and to take care of your

00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:17,179
arrangers this seems obvious but let

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,580
them work with other people putting an

00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:21,289
arranger by themselves in a room and

00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:24,169
saying alright work independently for

00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:26,359
the next 40 hours is not going to play

00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:28,580
well with them also allow them some

00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:30,019
space for some personal items they're

00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,090
probably going to have an emotional

00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:35,690
response to feedback that doesn't mean

00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:37,789
don't give people feedback just be aware

00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:41,450
and kind about it before you give an

00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:44,239
arranger feedback and for the

00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:46,429
visualizers how to tap into their

00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:49,659
strengths if you need somebody to id8

00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:53,869
which is a word I feel ambivalent

00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:55,519
ambivalently about existing but if you

00:31:53,869 --> 00:31:57,859
need somebody to you know draw on a

00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,809
whiteboard or read a brainstorming

00:31:57,859 --> 00:32:02,059
session the visualizer is your person

00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:04,369
for that they like lots of light and

00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:05,989
informal spaces to do their work in you

00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:07,460
hand them a pack of sharpies and bright

00:32:05,989 --> 00:32:12,399
post-its we'll be really thrilled with

00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:12,399
you and they can go anyway with feedback

00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:23,239
all right so how are you doing on time

00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:26,600
why thank you timekeeper for turning

00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:29,179
that over what I'm gonna have everybody

00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,730
do is take again two minutes because

00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:34,609
we're almost at the end turn to your

00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:36,499
neighbor ask about the result and ask if

00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:38,509
how they would like their co-workers to

00:32:36,499 --> 00:32:42,499
support them in in their productivity

00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:44,119
style first of all thanks everybody for

00:32:42,499 --> 00:32:46,340
for playing along with talking to each

00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:48,710
other I am so much of a rebel that I had

00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:51,399
no idea if anybody was actually going to

00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:51,399
speak to each other

00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:56,690
so bringing all that together right the

00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:59,450
the point that I'm trying to drive home

00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:01,159
today is that you can work really well

00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:03,289
and really collaboratively with people

00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:04,669
around you if you practice at it and pay

00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:07,460
attention to what those people need

00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:09,379
right so you might have started out

00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,940
accidentally in a leadership position or

00:33:09,379 --> 00:33:14,179
not have a lot of experience working

00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:17,269
with other people directly but if you

00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:17,960
practice regularly you can go from that

00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:21,769
ridiculous

00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,090
penguin airplane that I drew earlier to

00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:26,779
something that actually looks like a

00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:27,559
thing that was after about three weeks

00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:29,749
right

00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:33,529
practice is fantastic an intentional

00:33:29,749 --> 00:33:36,799
regular practice is even better so thank

00:33:33,529 --> 00:33:38,869
