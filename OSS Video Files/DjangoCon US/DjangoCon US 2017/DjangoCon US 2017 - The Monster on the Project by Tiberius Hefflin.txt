	DjangoCon US 2017 - The Monster on the Project by Tiberius Hefflin

Abusive behavior can have profound effects on personal relationships but it can also make open source contributing and office life miserable. For those stuck in a team with co workers who exhibit toxic behavior, going to work every day can feel like going to a battlefield. Knowing how to identify and how to respond to unreasonable behavior is vital. In this talk we will look at the ways we can improve our office and FOSS communities by recognizing, managing and gracefully removing this toxic behavior.

Take away:

What abuse looks like

How it affects those around it

Steps to take if you are the target of abusive behavior

How to manage toxic people in your project

[Music]

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,030
hi it's the last talk of a day

00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:22,390
let's try and keep that energy out stay

00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:25,869
awake we've got a picnic coming stay on

00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:28,630
top of that so as my lovely host

00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:30,310
flashlight introduced me I am tips we're

00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,779
here to talk about monsters and projects

00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,160
and if you're not here to talk about

00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:36,489
that you're probably in the wrong place

00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:39,850
so you might want to try next door and

00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:41,880
if my clicker will work we can get

00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,890
started

00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:47,470
so I'm Tibbs

00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:50,980
and this is how I imagine myself when

00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:54,700
I'm on stage to try and avoid any nerves

00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:56,590
and stress and fear about all of you out

00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:59,230
there so if you would also like to

00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:02,440
imagine me as a little domo con monster

00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:06,549
up here I'm more than happy to play into

00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:09,400
that currently I work at Intel well I

00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:11,680
work with Intel doing security

00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,299
assessments of the both open source

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,880
software that they want to use in-house

00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:17,530
and the software that they create that

00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,420
they want to push out to the open source

00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,520
community and that's based out in

00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,710
Hillsborough and I am originally from

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,049
Scotland so you might hear a little bit

00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:31,149
of that accident coming through just

00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:32,920
kind of smile at 24 I left a career to

00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:34,990
attend uni for the first time to study

00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,929
computer security forensics and ethical

00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:41,829
hacking and the career that I left was

00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:44,740
actually in HR and I had no idea at the

00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:47,590
time that I would use the skills and

00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:51,729
knowledge that I picked up in HR more

00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:53,619
often in my current job and in the

00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:55,959
open-source community than I ever did

00:01:53,619 --> 00:02:01,740
when I was doing HR full-time but that's

00:01:55,959 --> 00:02:01,740
how it is so

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,120
it helps if you turn it on so before I

00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:14,840
waved into tech and before I went into

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:18,440
HR before I had any inkling at all that

00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,520
I would not grow up to Train dolphins to

00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,480
speak English

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,700
I was this kid this was me going to

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,470
school pretty much every day from about

00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,080
seven years old and tell graduation I

00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:32,270
hate in school not cuz I didn't like

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,500
learning I love learning I love I

00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:36,560
learned new things every day and it's

00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:39,709
great I hated school because I was

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,290
really badly bullied and as a result I

00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:45,560
had poor grades I had poor attendance

00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:50,420
because I was always sick and I was a

00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:52,070
really sad lonely child and I don't

00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,360
remember how to do

00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,610
I don't remember learning how to do long

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,769
division and maybe that's why I'm not

00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,620
very good at it but I do remember in

00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:02,390
vivid detail the first day the other

00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:13,100
kids started throwing rocks at me from

00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:15,739
the bus when I wasn't reading every

00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:18,950
fantasy and sci-fi novel I could find

00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:22,850
I spent my youth dreaming about being an

00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:25,730
adult and escaping my unhappiness school

00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:27,860
I thought when I grew up I wouldn't have

00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,890
to deal with bullies I could believe all

00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:33,049
of that at graduation get my diploma and

00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:37,549
go on to bigger and better things I

00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:41,720
could actually start my life and that

00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:44,900
worked kind of until I was 23 and I

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:47,420
started a new job doing insurance repair

00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:52,100
administration I mean it wasn't the most

00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:54,799
exciting of things but my boss must have

00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,420
sensed blood in the water because it

00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,170
didn't take long for him to start

00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:02,930
picking on me when what started as small

00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:05,290
complaints about my work making up rules

00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:08,239
that didn't exist for everybody else

00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:11,120
soon escalated to him isolating me in

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:14,359
the conference room and berating me

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,440
until I broke down in tears I was

00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:18,350
horrible

00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:21,470
I may have been an adult but I felt like

00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:25,190
I was eight all over again I was back in

00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:27,380
school and somehow I still lacked the

00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:30,290
knowledge and skills to deal with this

00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:32,780
bully I knew what he was doing was wrong

00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:36,830
but I couldn't find my voice to speak up

00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:42,260
I felt trapped this is really not

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:44,180
uncommon at all in fact toxic behavior

00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,040
is a known problem in the workplace and

00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,960
has been for a while

00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:51,950
unfortunately statistics show that that

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:54,260
problem is only growing now while

00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:57,830
current studies are focused on workplace

00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,850
and educational environments as a result

00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,950
a lot of the language that I'm going to

00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:03,770
use here is going to be focused on these

00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:06,230
environments however toxic behavior is a

00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:08,120
concern and can present in any

00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:11,750
environment where people cohabitate or

00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,250
collaborate I mean I would any of you be

00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:17,900
surprised to know that I've heard

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:24,950
stories about toxic behavior in free and

00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:26,380
opensource environments projects yeah so

00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,820
it was like when I was in HR and

00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,860
investigating complaints I would hear

00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,550
from managers and project leads all the

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,140
time

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,390
they'd say over and over again they'd

00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:37,430
say so what we have a couple of

00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:39,080
difficult people on the project they're

00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,120
the high performers they're the

00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:44,720
rockstars they're the ones who get

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,940
things done well studies show that no

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,940
matter how well a toxic personality

00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:52,940
performs their behavior drags down the

00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:55,280
performance of the team to below what it

00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,970
would have been without them they

00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,919
actually negate any performance boost

00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:03,440
that management or anybody else may

00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:07,880
think that they provide the team but why

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,190
is that well being bullied as was the

00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:14,030
case when I was a child induces stress

00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:16,220
anxiety depression and a host of other

00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:18,850
physical and psychological medical

00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:22,070
issues for those who are the target a

00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:24,560
news show studies show that it can even

00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,570
create a form of post-traumatic stress

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,319
disorder like that seen amongst soldiers

00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:30,759
returning from war

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,460
more concerning though is a study

00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:36,100
showing that stress that the stress of

00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:40,150
bullying may actually lead to bad

00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:43,000
decision-making in 2009 a study found

00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:45,789
that stressed-out rats fail to adapt to

00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,449
changes in their environment a portion

00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:52,780
of their brain actually shrunk compared

00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:55,090
to the same region in relaxed rats let's

00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:58,930
think about that for a moment their

00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:01,389
brain actually changed as a result of

00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:05,919
the stress that they were experiencing

00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:08,680
and these findings suggests that stress

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,349
may actually rewire the brain and create

00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,840
an inability to make good decisions and

00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:15,940
maybe this is why we see in people who

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,740
are abused by their partners that they

00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:23,320
return to them over and over again

00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:26,650
before escaping the cycle of abuse now

00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:30,060
it's not easy to speak up when a person

00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:33,520
is being targeted by toxic behavior and

00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:36,310
abuse can have horrible effects on

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,470
self-esteem and often it starts so

00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:41,770
mildly that we convince ourselves that

00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,520
we're imagining it but even when we do

00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:48,250
speak up

00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:52,930
we're often met with disbelief or victim

00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:54,520
blaming or gaslighting or because we're

00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,650
the ones speaking up we're treated as

00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,889
the person who's the problem sometimes

00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:02,620
we're even fired for it the worst cases

00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:04,840
are when people take their lives because

00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:08,070
they see no other escape and that

00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,070
happens more often than you'd think

00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:16,180
that's for people who stay in hostile

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:18,509
environments I mean it took me a while

00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:21,370
to understand what was happening to me

00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:24,940
when I was being bullied in that first

00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:28,270
workplace situation but ever since I've

00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:31,330
been very willing to leave companies and

00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:32,079
projects at the first red flag that this

00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,959
might happen again

00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:37,630
and turnovers for teams with toxic

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,440
personalities are higher than in those

00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,440
teams without it

00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:48,340
high turnover is a problem both for

00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:51,490
business and for Foss projects for

00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:53,650
companies it's expensive there's a lot

00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:57,040
of expense and man-hours lost in

00:08:53,650 --> 00:09:00,370
recruiting interviewing and training new

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:03,040
employees on top of that new employees

00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,990
typically have a 4 to 6 month spin-up

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,650
period before they're actually able to

00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:11,500
perform at full productivity outside of

00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:13,420
this there's reputation costs and the

00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,910
hit to morale of the remaining team

00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,820
members I actually once worked at a

00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:22,060
company that had a betting pool on how

00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:24,130
long new employees were going to last it

00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:26,500
wasn't a very welcoming environment and

00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:29,290
you can bet as soon as I found that out

00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:31,270
I put my resume back on market I was

00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:34,030
looking for any job because I didn't

00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:35,860
want to be there the toxic environment

00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,840
had become such a core component of the

00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,700
work culture that they were unable to

00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:45,610
see that it was actively sabotaging

00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:47,830
their efforts to improve Foss projects

00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:50,320
can also suffer from reputation loss as

00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:53,290
well as potentially losing new and

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,360
existing contributors Foss projects risk

00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:57,850
losing the undocumented tribal knowledge

00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,810
that members take with them when they

00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:03,100
leave I think we all know companies and

00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:06,070
projects that we wouldn't even consider

00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:10,360
working with I mean we still have uber

00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:13,150
dealing with a fallout of the last half

00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,500
a year or more and Google has certainly

00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:20,470
taken a reputation hit in the last

00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:23,800
couple of weeks so we know the

00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:28,360
consequences but what exactly is the

00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:30,940
problem what is toxic behavior and how

00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:35,980
do we recognize it when we know we have

00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:39,790
a problem well for employees and

00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:42,580
contributors there are lots of forms of

00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:43,990
bullying and abuse and it'd be really

00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,030
difficult for me to cover them all here

00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,890
but in a survey that was carried out

00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:50,230
recently the most common reported signs

00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:52,420
of bullying included being falsely

00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:55,389
accused of mistake so they didn't make

00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:59,260
their comments being ignored dismissed

00:10:55,389 --> 00:11:01,870
or not acknowledged having a different

00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:04,440
set of standards or policies applied to

00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:07,600
them that aren't applied to anybody else

00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:10,750
gossip being spread about them or not

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,639
being stopped by their manager being

00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:15,550
constantly criticized by their boss or

00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:17,470
co-worker belittling comments that were

00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:20,980
made about their work during meetings in

00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:23,370
front of other people being yelled at by

00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:26,470
their manager in front of other people

00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:29,560
perhaps they're purposely excluded from

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:31,470
projects or meetings or credit for the

00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:35,290
work has been stolen

00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:39,639
lastly they were picked on for personal

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:40,959
attributes these are all things that for

00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:42,730
the most part are against code of

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:48,010
conduct but can sometimes be hard to

00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:51,220
pinpoint so what about from an employer

00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:52,930
or Project Lead perspective well my

00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:56,170
personal experience is that people who

00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:58,870
treat others downstream poorly or who

00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:01,480
hoard knowledge are potentially toxic

00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:04,089
personalities studies showed that

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,810
employees who are overconfident or

00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:06,760
self-centered

00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:09,399
are more likely to have toxic

00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:12,010
personality traits but what surprised me

00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,269
about the same study was that they found

00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:16,510
that people who believed that rules

00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:19,870
should always be followed were more

00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:22,180
likely to exhibit toxic behavior the

00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,380
researchers hypothesized that this was

00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,760
due to the subjects telling the

00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:27,820
interview what they thought they wanted

00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:30,070
to hear and they said it could be the

00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:33,310
case that those who claimed the rules

00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:36,010
should be followed in all cases are more

00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:38,560
Machiavellian at nature purporting to

00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:41,560
embrace whatever rules characteristics

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,470
or beliefs that they believe are more

00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,050
likely to obtain them the job and there

00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:49,630
is a strong evidence that

00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:52,019
Machiavellianism leads to two deviant

00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,019
behavior

00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:58,240
it's also important that the employer

00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,550
and Project Lead look at the behavior

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,210
the team members around a potentially

00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:06,480
toxic person stress will often affect

00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:11,080
time management skills ability to focus

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,970
health and cause burnout and if the

00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:17,710
behavior of an employee or project

00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:18,850
member alters suddenly really the first

00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:21,000
step should be to talk to them

00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:23,470
proactively and see what's going on

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,580
maybe they're not being bullied maybe

00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,310
they just have something going on in

00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:30,640
their personal life but talking to you

00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:32,860
talking to them about it will help you

00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:38,040
know what's going on and will help them

00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:41,890
because sharing is always a good way to

00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,900
help relieve a little bit of stress but

00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:45,580
the important but the kind of second

00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:48,040
step there is if you ask somebody what's

00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,450
going on for them how they're doing you

00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,850
really need to actually listen to them

00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:55,240
it doesn't do any good to ask and and

00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:56,920
not absorb that I think that a lot of us

00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,300
have experienced the feeling of talking

00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:04,210
to somebody without actually feeling

00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:09,880
heard so now that we've identified the

00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:12,280
problem how do we fix it for employees

00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,780
and contributors it can be really

00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,690
difficult but the best course of action

00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:20,340
is to stay professional don't

00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:22,990
reciprocate disengage where possible

00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:25,120
journal the incidents like seriously

00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,870
just get a piece of paper and start

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,730
writing things down

00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,920
it'll keep things straight in your mind

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:32,860
and give you a record so that you can

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:37,180
refer to it later on and I know that for

00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:39,460
me it really helps when I feel like the

00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:43,180
person that I'm dealing with has an

00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:46,090
alternate experience of events as

00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:49,240
sometimes happens especially with gas

00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:50,290
lighting and which is the process of

00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,490
somebody telling you that something you

00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:55,180
experienced didn't happen the way that

00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:58,420
you experienced it talk to your manager

00:14:55,180 --> 00:15:02,680
or it's the HR person if the bully is

00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:04,060
your manager in fukin foss situations

00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,460
this can be a little bit more difficult

00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:09,520
because it's not always that hierarchy

00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:13,350
in smaller projects but talk to somebody

00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:15,970
else in the community and start kind of

00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:19,810
asking seeing if other people are

00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:22,000
experiencing the same thing you are if

00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:24,210
no action is taken it may be time for

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,530
you to look for your next opportunity

00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:28,810
but more importantly talk to your

00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:30,790
friends and your family and start

00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:34,260
engaging on that network of support that

00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:38,110
you have and share your experiences and

00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:40,210
if you have time and resources if the

00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:42,610
bullying or toxic behavior is really

00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:48,250
affecting you badly consider seeking

00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:51,340
therapy to help get you through regards

00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:53,770
the person who is exhibiting toxic

00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:57,570
behavior it's sad

00:15:53,770 --> 00:16:00,520
but important to acknowledge that

00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:02,680
extreme in extreme cases expulsion for

00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:06,580
the group is a step that may become

00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:10,030
necessary people have to want to change

00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:13,210
and to be able to adapt to new

00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:15,970
expectations and as much as we might

00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:18,880
want them to and we might want to we

00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:21,270
can't fix everybody that said I think

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,890
that expulsion should really be like a

00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:26,230
last-ditch no options left decision

00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:29,950
there's a lot to be done that can be

00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:33,010
done to try and reform a person who is

00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:34,960
exhibiting toxic behavior now you might

00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:39,180
ask what the point of that would be if

00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:42,210
they're bringing down the whole team but

00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:46,300
in response to that I'd like to say that

00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:48,370
 are people too and like all

00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,950
people they deserve to be treated with

00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:53,710
dignity and compassion and studies show

00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:55,330
that actually the reformation of an

00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:57,610
offender is more productive and less

00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:59,589
disruptive to the group the project

00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:02,530
doesn't lose the tribal knowledge that

00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:04,720
that person has and the injured parties

00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:06,819
are actually will actually benefit from

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,040
going through the resolution process and

00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:10,959
getting closure rather than just having

00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,949
the end the issue go on address because

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,949
the person is now gone

00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:22,079
it may not surprise you that adults are

00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:25,679
actually a lot like big children I know

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:29,159
I am a lot of the tactics that a manager

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,870
or project lead can employ to tame toxic

00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:34,049
behavior are ones that we learned from

00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:37,640
parenting books the end goal is finding

00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:40,200
a new way to motivate the worker now

00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,700
kind of at the very base of things there

00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,600
are two ways of doing this the carrot

00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,120
and the stick

00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:48,690
offering a reward for good behavior and

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,159
a negative action for poor behavior the

00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,690
trick is learning which rewards and

00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:53,279
punishments will motivate which workers

00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,450
and this is gonna be different for

00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:58,289
everybody so there's a little bit of

00:17:54,450 --> 00:18:00,270
trial and error involved it's also

00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:02,610
important throughout the process to be

00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:05,130
incredibly clear about which behaviors

00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:08,880
are unacceptable and that they must stop

00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:13,110
immediately I have seen time and time

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:15,450
again when I was in HR people who would

00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:17,970
be brought in and told that their

00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:21,720
behavior was unacceptable listen to the

00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:24,390
letter of the rule of the law and did

00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,299
the bare minimum they totally would

00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:30,419
rules lawyer exactly what they could and

00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:33,360
could not do and would actually kind of

00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:36,419
try and skirt that line just to spite

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,100
the person that was enforcing the rules

00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:40,740
or sometimes the person that reported

00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,890
them so it can be really important to

00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,149
watch out for that type of behavior

00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:48,510
Reformation does take work from

00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:51,120
everybody involved the organization the

00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:57,720
person and the team but it can also be

00:18:51,120 --> 00:19:00,950
really really rewarding to that an ounce

00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:03,840
of prevention is worth a pound of cure

00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:05,070
setting behavior expectations right

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:10,190
right from the beginning with a code of

00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:13,440
conduct or a set of project values is

00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:16,980
going to stop a hate bad behavior before

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:20,549
it starts or at least provide an

00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,110
expectation and around that a robust

00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:23,940
framework needs to be put in place to

00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:26,789
support members when they feel that they

00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,490
have experienced bullying fostering good

00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:30,920
communication skills

00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:32,750
and providing a safe environment for

00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,450
people to talk about feelings in

00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:39,170
conflict conflict resolution is also

00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:42,230
really vital look at the learning and

00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:44,360
communication styles as a team because

00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:46,570
we all communicate differently and we

00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:50,270
all learn differently and sometimes

00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:52,460
these mismatches can cause friction and

00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:56,600
learning how to deal with that and how

00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:58,940
to communicate through that is a good

00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,030
way of stopping conflict before it

00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:04,220
happens

00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:06,740
teach conflict resolution skills and use

00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:10,880
statements like when you say blank

00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:16,040
I hear blank is that what you meant it

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:18,910
can be really a good way to remove the

00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:21,710
feeling of being personally attacked and

00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,940
remove and stop somebody from feeling

00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,740
the need to get defensive about

00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:29,420
something they've said or of action that

00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:31,190
they've done also don't penalize people

00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:33,470
for needing to take a break from

00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:36,350
difficult conversations people get

00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:37,730
overwhelmed and everybody in the office

00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:40,880
or on the project should be able to say

00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:43,370
okay I need five minutes or I need over

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,310
to overnight to think about this let's

00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:47,210
come back to this conversation tomorrow

00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:49,130
it doesn't mean that the issue is

00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:52,370
resolved or that we're not going to talk

00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:55,700
about it anymore but people do often

00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:57,200
need to take take time away and I'm

00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:00,410
definitely this kind of person where

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,910
when I'm in a confrontation often it'll

00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:04,550
get too emotional for me and I need to

00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:07,520
take time away to sort through what's

00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:12,820
going on in my brain and what what I'm

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:15,860
experiencing versus what's happening and

00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:18,440
in the wider community we need to value

00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:19,850
soft skills not just coding abilities

00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,370
all these things I'm talking about like

00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:24,770
conflict resolution communication these

00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:27,710
are all soft skills that take time to

00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:29,420
develop when we brush bad behavior under

00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:31,760
the rug just because somebody is a

00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:33,860
really great coder we're doing a

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,170
disservice to everyone including that

00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:39,120
person because we're denying them the

00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:41,520
chance to grow and improve as a person

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,410
more than that we as a community need to

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,720
talk about this problem and call out

00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,890
poor behavior when we see it we're

00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:54,360
getting there but there's still a lot of

00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:56,010
room to grow our communities also need

00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,860
to make an active effort to discuss

00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:02,780
mental health often mental health issues

00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:04,590
are actually the root of toxic behavior

00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,810
especially on address mental health

00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:08,940
issues and if mental health was not such

00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:10,170
a taboo topic people would feel more

00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,260
free to talk about the problems that

00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:15,030
they're experiencing and seek help I'm

00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,940
actually an advocate of the open source

00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:19,860
Minh sourcing mental health charity

00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,480
which seeks to raise awareness and

00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:24,840
actually educate people about mental

00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:28,050
health issues within the open source

00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:30,060
community they provide resources to

00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:31,710
companies projects and people who are

00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:34,650
struggling with mental health issues and

00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:35,970
the website is really incredibly helpful

00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:37,680
and full of a lot of really great

00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:44,550
information so I would highly recommend

00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:50,160
that you go have a look these are some

00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:51,420
further resources and I'd like to take a

00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,510
moment to think

00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:56,520
Jenko Khan for having me and I'd like to

00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:59,010
thank everybody here for being so quiet

00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:02,430
and attentive you've been a fantastic

00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:12,770
audience so does anybody like this cat

00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:15,960
have questions so on a personal note

00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:18,230
confronting abusers can be a scary thing

00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,090
for the person to the confrontation

00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:23,130
definitely yeah do you have any tips on

00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:24,720
how to deal with that sort of thing to

00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:30,870
get yourself to a point where you can

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:33,630
confront I think that talking to others

00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:37,380
and taking somebody with you can be

00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:40,950
really valuable in HR we we always I say

00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:43,410
we in in British HR when we're having

00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:45,150
like a disciplinary action or even some

00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:48,180
kind of serious talk with an employee

00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:50,490
and an employer a manager we always

00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:51,430
encourage the employee to bring somebody

00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:53,770
with them

00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:56,440
like just just somebody there to be a

00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:57,430
witness because then if something

00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,420
happens if somebody says something

00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:00,310
inappropriate

00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:03,520
then you've got somebody there who who

00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:05,490
also heard it and it is less of a less

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:09,310
of a he said/she said kind of situation

00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:11,290
but also it can be really good for the

00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:13,270
person who's making the complaint to be

00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:15,490
able to have that extra person there

00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:17,590
just to know they're not alone because

00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:19,150
sometimes that I know that that gets me

00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:21,220
every time feeling like I'm alone in

00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:24,580
something so having somebody there with

00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:27,850
you or even sometimes I've had I've seen

00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:29,290
people write down their concerns and

00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:31,990
having that piece of paper in front of

00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:34,420
you I'm guilty of this all the time my

00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:36,760
brain goes blank and so having a piece

00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:38,050
of paper that kind of has all the points

00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,990
that I wanted to make in front of me can

00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:44,440
be really really helpful and know that

00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:46,330
the the fear and the stress is temporary

00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,040
and that once you kind of get that all

00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:51,040
out there and start that conflict

00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:54,190
resolution situation things will get

00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,780
better I mean it may not end the way

00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:58,480
that you want it to but at least that

00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:04,450
that feeling of being in limbo will be

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:07,570
over you mentioned that sometimes it's

00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:13,000
necessary to remove someone from from

00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:15,040
the group how how do you know or like

00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,200
you have any parameters you can use to

00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,990
say this person has been given the

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:25,690
opportunity to change but it's time to

00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:27,430
remove them because I think that there

00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:30,310
are a lot of variables a lot of it

00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:32,770
depends on what type of behavior the

00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:36,820
person is exhibiting a lot of it depends

00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:41,530
on how how sincerely they're trying to

00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:48,900
improve a lot of it also is up to the

00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:51,580
group and how how much stress and

00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:53,860
conflict that the group can actually

00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:56,680
itself handle I've certainly seen

00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:59,590
situations where we've had somebody who

00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:02,970
was really great but we just at that

00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:04,690
time didn't have the structure or the

00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:06,520
support necessary

00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:09,070
in order to include them in part of it

00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,420
as part of the group that didn't mean

00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,650
that they wouldn't be welcome and future

00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:14,230
when we did have those resources

00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:15,940
available but sometimes it is just a

00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,620
determination of what resources are

00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:21,760
available and how willing the person is

00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:25,120
to really try and improve but if you

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:27,010
have a specific incident that you'd like

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:30,370
to talk about I'm happy to discuss that

00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:32,950
with you later that's about all the time

00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:34,970
we have for questions so thank you very

00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:42,749
much again tips

00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:42,749
