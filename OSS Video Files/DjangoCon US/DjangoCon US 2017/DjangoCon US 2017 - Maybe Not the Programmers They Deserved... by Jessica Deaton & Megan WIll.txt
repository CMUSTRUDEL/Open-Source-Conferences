	DjangoCon US 2017 - Maybe Not the Programmers They Deserved, but the Programmers They Needed  by Jessica Deaton & Megan WIll

Is there something you would change in the world if you were a wizard?

Make vulnerability your cloak
Make determination your hat
Make code your wand

What do you care about?

We care about girls and women being enabled to choose their future
We care about increasing diversity in the trade we love
We care about arming children with the confidence that they can do anything


Why are we here?

We’re trying to use our programming skills to make that a reality. It’s a journey, one we invite you to join for whatever you feel strongly about. We were not the first, we were definitely not the best, and we won’t be the last. But sometimes, inspiring people to help is just as hard (or harder) than helping. We wanted to give this talk to show others that it CAN be done and YOU can make a difference - regardless of your skill level or experience.


Our Story

1. The Use Case

Listening: “I’ve been wanting to teach Python for a while but we don’t have anyone.” - Girl Scout Leader

Acting: “I can do that!” - [Presenter 1] (even though she was pretty sure the ideal person was way more experienced than her)

Deliverable: The Hackathon - A Python challenge for both beginner and advanced coders. Two classes, 25 girls each, ages 10-18 years old.


2. A Master Plan

Check out our options: We reviewed existing resources, but didn’t find anything to meet our needs (list some of the good resources we found and were inspired by)

Make a decision: “Let’s write our own!” - [Presenters] (because nothing that’s out there fits in two hours…)

Have a Cool Learning Experience: Coding the game and taking our first stabs at writing the tutorial were great learning opportunities for us!


3. The Dream Team (AKA: Help!)

The Pair Programmers: Gaining perspective and tripling productivity, Megan and Jessica start figuring out what to teach and begin making the tutorial come to life

The Project Manager: Added for some very necessary skills - making things looking professional, doing a code freeze, checking our spelling, and making sure the presentation is consistent

The Coaching Team: With a common goal and united front, an all female team of software developers, engineers and IT managers unite to form a coaching group!

4. Go Live

Hot Fixes: 
The girls begin the tutorial and questions come rolling in. Confusion abounds. They don’t know what a Start button is! Nothing shows them their opinion matters like change, so we began live editing the tutorial! Being vulnerable, admitting imperfection, and not taking it personally evolved the tutorial in real time to fit our audience. It also gave the girls a sense of inclusion that was priceless; even though they weren’t writing the code to make the edits, their voice was heard and their suggestions were implemented in real time - a powerful way to build confidence!

Unexpected Popularity: 
The girls were engaged! Among raised and waving hands and the din of voices, we kept our cool and took each issue one step at a time. Frankly, we were all a little in shock.

Better than we imagined: 
We might have expected too little of ourselves, but when all was said and done - the girls felt successful, they were all engaged, and their parents were inspired to learn for themselves or keep their girls involved with code going forward!

5. Refactoring

Simplification:
It was late and everyone was tired - make things simpler, have more milestones, include more affirmations

Organization: 
Planning pre- and post- tutorial huddles to get to know each other and set expectations, figuring out how to guide/redirect parents who were doing the tutorial for their child, investigate letting the girls try pair programming

Keep Building: 
We are still working to evolve our tutorial, make it more accessible, make it friendlier for our target age group, make it packaged to shared, and shopping it around to other tutorials as an expansion (we’re looking at you DjangoGirls ;) )

6. An Ever Expanding Universe

Sharing is caring: 
We did it and so can you! Expanding the number of contributors as well as the project scope will only make things better! So, we will share our code, share out tutorial, share our experiences, and share our enthusiasm with anyone who wants to make a change!

The Takeaways

You have a lot of power, in the you code help create, in the people you mentor

Don’t wait for someone else, endowed with imaginary super coding/people skills, to help create the change you want -do what needs to be done

Act.

[Music]

00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:23,380
okay Megan does your mic on oh please

00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,380
God don't let me have to do this alone

00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:29,900
perfect cool all right and welcome today

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,670
to the presentation

00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:36,680
maybe not the programers day it deserved

00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:37,970
but the programmers they needed maybe

00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:45,050
then it won't be a presentation today

00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:47,390
all right all right one win so we're

00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,920
talking about so my name is Megan well

00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,420
I'm a senior software engineer at the

00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,550
University of Texas

00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,410
I'm Jessica Deaton I'm a senior software

00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:57,379
developer at the University of Texas at

00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:59,590
Austin as well we're the co-creators of

00:00:57,379 --> 00:01:02,059
learning Python on Wars which is a

00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:05,630
text-based adventure tutorial game we

00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:08,090
wrote for the Girl Scouts of Austin so

00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,860
maybe today because you're like I'd like

00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:16,549
to do things in the world maybe make it

00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:19,670
better or maybe I'm just not an expert

00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:22,340
or a rockstar code ninja or maybe I'm

00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:26,210
not a great teacher maybe I just don't

00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:31,100
know how well we're kind of here today

00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:34,100
because we'd like to see people in

00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:36,530
development and we think part of that

00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:39,740
starts with people getting exposed to

00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:44,509
the younger age so we got involved with

00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:46,790
teaching Python yeah so first we wanted

00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:50,000
to start with a little metaphor and a

00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:52,939
small disclaimer here I I am NOT a

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,189
Batman aficionado I do enjoy it but I

00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:55,399
don't know ton about him sorry about

00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:57,740
that

00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:01,720
also for copyright infringement reasons

00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:04,729
we've chosen to use our own terrible bat

00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,750
so you know bear with us first time

00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:08,989
speakers we didn't know what kind of

00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,900
trouble we might get into so yeah so

00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:13,310
back to the metaphor there's a

00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,830
approximately 10 million people living

00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:19,400
in Gotham City and fortunately there is

00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:20,100
only one Batman so given the high number

00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,840
of crime

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,270
in Gotham City higher than average I

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,390
would say the amount of transit time

00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,890
between places in Gotham supervillains

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,470
that's a whole nother issue that takes

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,300
up a lot of time and just the fact that

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,150
Batman is not always Batman he spends a

00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,220
lot of time being party boy Bruce Wayne

00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:40,470
so given all of those things if I happen

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,960
to be in distress I'm wondering Megan

00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:45,120
how much of a chance do I have Batman

00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,400
actually rescuing me yeah Jessica I'm

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,590
afraid the chances just aren't great not

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,810
so great yeah that's what I was afraid

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,670
of and we're not very great with math so

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,170
if any of you guys want to actually

00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,210
figure out the statistics and really

00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:00,660
scare me to death please do so after

00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:02,250
this and let me know but basically we

00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,320
need you to help that's what it all

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,180
comes down to we can't just sit around

00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,070
and wait for Batman to show up we need

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,970
people like Commissioner Gordon and the

00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:12,660
police department

00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:14,760
we need firemen we need nurses doctors

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,680
everyday people to step up and help

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,180
their community and right now there's a

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,920
lot of people that think they need to

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,010
sit around and wait for someone with

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,260
more experience more talent and that's

00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,670
just not true and we wanted to hopefully

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,170
share with you guys today that you can

00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:33,090
also be a big help without being Batman

00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:38,880
yeah so we're offering to let you learn

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:41,130
from our experience so for me this all

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,680
started I was helping coordinated jingo

00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:46,020
Girls tutorial in Austin Texas where we

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,690
live and I was talking to a local stem

00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,800
leader for the Girl Scouts and she

00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,990
mentioned that she'd been wanting to

00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,060
teach Python for a while but she didn't

00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:56,610
have anybody to do it and so I thought

00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,260
oh I can do that and I was pretty sure

00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:01,020
that the ideal person was a lot cooler

00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,850
than me but I was like well something's

00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,310
better than nothing right so they had a

00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:07,230
hackathon coming up they kind of wanted

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,090
to do a basic in advance class there

00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,100
were gonna be maybe like 25 people max

00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,310
in each class they were gonna be ages 10

00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:18,540
to 18 and it was gonna be from 8:00 to

00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:23,190
midnight Friday almost a deal breaker

00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:24,780
that Friday night thing yeah yeah so

00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,370
we're gonna give you some hints but do

00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,440
keep in mind that this is based on our

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,910
personal experience we were very new to

00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,680
doing something like this so your

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,970
mileage may vary but we think that

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,390
there's some pretty good takeaways here

00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,320
for you

00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:39,210
so go ahead Megan hint number one

00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,150
so our first hint is to do some research

00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:44,550
so before I got into this whole thing

00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:46,620
that I looked at you know tutorials that

00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,900
already existed tried to figure out what

00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:52,230
would fit into ours and what could cover

00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:54,780
both basic and more advanced Python and

00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:56,940
I couldn't find anything that would fit

00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,250
quite right so I decided to make my own

00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,960
a Python text adventure game if you're

00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,940
not familiar with the Hitchhiker's Guide

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,000
to the galaxy text adventure game you

00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:07,620
should check it out sweet so I thought

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,190
if I was a Girl Scout I would think that

00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,230
was fun but I did a lot of research I

00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,370
decided to level up because I had a

00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,350
moment where I was like I'm not cool

00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:19,370
enough that's the moment where you have

00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:22,920
your own montage and there's cool music

00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:25,620
so do a lot of reading figure out what's

00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,020
already there use it talk to other

00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,580
people don't create in a vacuum if I had

00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,010
created this in a vacuum it would have

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,080
gone terribly because I created a text

00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:35,760
adventure game it was fun to play I was

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,040
like this is it it's awesome

00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:41,400
I took it to Jessica I was like what do

00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:43,680
you think Jessica and she was like I'm

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,810
game but do you really think you should

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,250
cover a class based inheritance in like

00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:54,620
a basic Python class yeah for 10

00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,620
year-olds is maybe a little you know uh

00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:02,460
yeah so there we go so hint to is to

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,220
make a plan so after you've done a lot

00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,960
of research decided where you think your

00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,510
experience level kind of fits in and

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,060
what how big of a risk you're willing to

00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:14,850
take with making the leap into helping

00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,010
your community it's a good idea for you

00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:19,770
to decide who it is that you want to

00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:21,990
help that's the first thing and we'll

00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,800
have some good suggestions for that for

00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,230
you guys later

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,850
next you want to figure out how you want

00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:30,690
to help and there's some things you

00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:32,820
might want to consider namely cost you

00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:35,160
can do things for free you can also go

00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:38,040
out all and find sponsors and try to do

00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,920
fancier things you also kind of want to

00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,110
figure out your role by de facto Megan

00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,870
became the leader because it was his I

00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,740
her idea she said yes we all kind of got

00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,699
Rifton but she

00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:53,099
our leaders and then also venue

00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:54,389
getting a venue can be challenging there

00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:55,680
are definitely people in the community

00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:57,479
that have already been working with

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,220
mentorship and doing workshops and I

00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:02,280
would reach out to them to try to get

00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:04,110
ideas about venue but keep in mind too

00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,160
that it should be non distracting and

00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,319
fit within your budget

00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,110
you also want to think about supplies

00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,669
that you might need to buy or the medium

00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,259
you want to work in so if you choose to

00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:14,940
do something with raspberry PI's you'll

00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,889
need to probably buy some raspberry PI's

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,599
if everyone's going to be working on

00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:20,039
tablets or laptops that's something else

00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:22,020
you need to figure out ahead of time and

00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:25,500
make sure that you've planned for power

00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:27,990
outlets that was a direct that was a

00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,639
direct hint from the barbara and katie

00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:32,849
talk that they gave about the young

00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,470
coders so stole that and we have some

00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:36,300
more suggestions coming later but

00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,919
basically figure out how you want to

00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,770
build or if you want to help someone

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,880
that's already started or if you want to

00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,199
just use something that's already out

00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,000
there that's a big decision to make and

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,270
doing your research will help you make

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,889
that decision so our plan was to help

00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:51,389
the Girl Scouts they came to us so it

00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:53,699
was super easy we didn't really have to

00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:55,560
make any big decisions there we decided

00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:58,020
to build because it was difficult to do

00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,880
anything in two hours and nothing really

00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:02,940
existed that would meet that timeline

00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:05,729
for us we also didn't want to spend any

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,199
extra time having them set up email

00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:08,610
accounts to get into things that already

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,860
existed because it was just gonna eat

00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,000
into the two hours that we did have and

00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,710
we thought it would be a good learning

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,550
experience for the two of us and it

00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:19,440
totally was so the other thing is be

00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:22,050
perfectly comfortable with being

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,669
imperfect this is so important because

00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,039
the first time around you're definitely

00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:29,430
not going to get it right much like this

00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:30,930
talk right now there are plenty of

00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,430
opportunities being perfect but it

00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,060
doesn't mean that it's not helpful so

00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:39,180
keep that in mind

00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:42,000
so three ask for help Batman isn't a

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:45,570
one-man show you think that you're wrong

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,459
he has Alfred he is batboy Catwoman

00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,470
helps out and depending from what

00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:50,910
universe right Gotham or whatever there

00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,700
are a lot of other people that help

00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:54,620
Batman

00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,970
and secondly like a lot of other people

00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,440
would probably like to help you know

00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,970
they'd like to help make the world a

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,920
better place and if you have an idea for

00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:04,520
it let's let them in on it you know

00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:06,710
share the glory so I had a wonderful

00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,270
group of people Jessica obviously came

00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:11,000
and helped make the tutorial not

00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:12,380
horrible and scary and then we had

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,470
Caroline Taylor

00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:18,290
Rebecca Post Maggie Pfeiffer Monique

00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,630
Murphy and Britt Iman Cod who all came

00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:22,850
and helped at the actual hackathon and

00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:24,560
they were maybe more important than the

00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,990
actual tutorial itself because they were

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,180
real women who work in tech were able to

00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,010
be there for the Girl Scouts and show

00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,080
them what it was like to be a real

00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:36,590
person who does that and give them some

00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:38,930
interaction and it's also harder to fail

00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:45,100
when there are more people that share

00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:47,360
the blame I'm just kidding okay so

00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,670
another important thing is to figure out

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,770
what it is that your audience wants to

00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:54,320
get out of whatever help you decide to

00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:56,840
give so what interests them what goals

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,940
do they have these are important things

00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,920
to figure out you know and do a little

00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,270
more research about or try to tailor the

00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,100
fit for whatever it is you're trying to

00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:06,740
accomplish to the actual goals of the

00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,510
people that you're trying to help also

00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,340
you want to consider experience levels

00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:12,050
of your attendees some people will be at

00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,670
a much higher level some people will be

00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:16,070
complete novice and you need to be able

00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:18,140
to kind of adjust accordingly

00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,850
really if you think that they are gonna

00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,230
have people with different needs and

00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,090
different experience levels you may

00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:27,200
consider doing completely different

00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:29,360
solutions for those people we we tried

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,310
we were told we would have two different

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,630
classes one of complete beginners one

00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,040
with a little more experience and it

00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,710
turned it out to be more of a giant

00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,230
blended class that slowly trickled in as

00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,610
they felt they were ready which made it

00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:42,980
a little difficult to meet their needs

00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:45,470
so in the future we may try to segregate

00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,760
that a little bit more and also you want

00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:50,120
to keep in mind that no one is going to

00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:52,390
master concepts at they're gonna ask

00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,680
your content concepts at their own time

00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:57,260
and they're all gonna do it differently

00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,300
so don't make assumptions

00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:02,000
no one's gonna master everything they

00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,920
probably won't master anything they will

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,320
maybe gain a knowledge of something to

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,330
give them the confidence to move forward

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,890
but no one is gonna sit down in two

00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:12,380
hours or eight hours and know all of

00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:14,060
Python or no all of Django or no all of

00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,650
web development it's just not gonna

00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:19,400
happen I still don't know I've been in

00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:22,160
the game for four years and also keep in

00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,720
mind that not everybody enjoys coding I

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,850
definitely have days where I don't enjoy

00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,820
coding but for the most part I really

00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:30,200
like it and you may have people come and

00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,640
say they are excited about coding and

00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,280
get there and decide this isn't for them

00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:37,790
and that's totally okay we had girls

00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:40,220
show up that were super engaged we also

00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:42,650
had girls show up that were deciding

00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,720
pizza and dancing in the aisles was much

00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:46,580
more their speed and they got up and had

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:52,040
a great time and it was great dancing so

00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:56,450
we were fine with that too so expect the

00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:58,550
unexpected so it really shouldn't be

00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:00,770
unexpected it should just be you know

00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:04,340
part of life that things don't always go

00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:05,900
exactly as you plan don't panic it can

00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,760
actually be kind of fun you know you

00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,230
have like a new challenge and just go

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,240
for it

00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:14,680
so as Jessica mentioned sort of like you

00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,980
know two groups of 25 was not the case

00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,350
at all

00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:21,350
we had like seven girls come at first

00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:23,000
and it slowly turned into like 50 it's

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,350
kind of crazy it was kind of awesome

00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,350
because it meant that many people wanted

00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:28,700
to learn Python and be introduced to it

00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:30,770
and it was a good thing that we kind of

00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:33,290
had made the tutorials so that it could

00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:35,990
scale up easily based on how much you

00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:38,660
already knew so that way we had sort of

00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:40,130
a plan in place for you know what if

00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:43,070
somebody already knows about you know

00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:44,810
variables and data types but maybe they

00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:47,180
don't know how to do loops they could

00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:49,520
just get forward to that another thing

00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,110
was it it was amazing we had a lot of

00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,910
parents come and we're really excited

00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:55,640
about coding and learning to code

00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:57,440
themselves which was awesome but also

00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,910
sometimes it got in the way as the

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,500
children themselves getting to think

00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:02,600
about the problems and as we all know as

00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,190
developers may be more important than

00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,880
the code we write is how we think about

00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:09,230
the problem and design it so something

00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,180
we ran into and weren't quite sure how

00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:14,359
to deal with was giving the children

00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:17,839
their space to think about the problems

00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:19,819
and then lastly they didn't really know

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,859
what a starter a safe button was and

00:13:19,819 --> 00:13:23,600
that was really frightening we were like

00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:24,499
all assembler like we're so old we

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:31,639
didn't realize we with that

00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:33,470
old already it's a super bummer so that

00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:36,049
kind of leads right into our next tent

00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:39,410
which is just to be vulnerable and this

00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:41,179
is so super important you can you know

00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,259
we've we're getting vulnerable by

00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:44,239
getting up here and giving this talk

00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:45,799
it's our first time but we want to share

00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:47,989
this information with people and so

00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:49,369
we're putting ourselves out there same

00:13:47,989 --> 00:13:50,989
thing with this tutorial we had never

00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:53,389
written a tutorial before we had never

00:13:50,989 --> 00:13:54,769
worked with this age group before and

00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:56,569
being vulnerable meant that we were

00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:59,089
willing to expose the fact that we

00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:01,809
weren't super experts at this to them

00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:04,850
and it ended up working out super well

00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:06,769
being human is super inspiring and it's

00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:11,329
okay to be human and it's okay to make

00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:13,699
mistakes and so for us you know taking

00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:15,139
feedback was also a huge part of being

00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:16,879
vulnerable it means that people are

00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:18,829
gonna be critiquing your work stuff that

00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:21,619
you've put your heart and soul into and

00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:23,089
a lot of time into and you think oh I've

00:14:21,619 --> 00:14:24,859
got a diss level it's super great and

00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:26,869
then someone's like oh not so much and

00:14:24,859 --> 00:14:28,730
that's okay like that's how you get

00:14:26,869 --> 00:14:31,249
better so being able to take that

00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:33,619
feedback graciously regardless if it's a

00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:37,249
critic or a co-worker a friend a

00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:39,919
colleague or a ten-year-old girl so our

00:14:37,249 --> 00:14:41,749
real human moment during this remember

00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:43,819
those start buttons and save buttons

00:14:41,749 --> 00:14:45,649
that was pretty much the beginning of

00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:47,209
the tutorial so once they didn't know

00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:53,389
what those things were we were like oh

00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:55,699
no we decided to do live editing on the

00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:57,559
tutorial as it was taking place your

00:14:55,699 --> 00:15:00,470
mileage might vary with that and I don't

00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:01,999
necessarily recommend it but it actually

00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,069
turned out to be a good experience for

00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:06,169
us as the girls started making

00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,879
suggestions and asking questions we got

00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:10,369
right in there and started implementing

00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:12,439
that stuff as they were rolling in and I

00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:13,970
think it ended up being really inspiring

00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:15,829
for the girls that were working in the

00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:18,289
tutorial because they became part of

00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:20,239
making this thing they could see that

00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:23,209
their stuff was being implemented at the

00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:24,679
same time that they were asking it so it

00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:25,980
also let them know that they were kind

00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:27,360
of de-facto coding

00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,060
like even though they weren't writing

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,880
the code they were actively manipulating

00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:35,780
codebase with with very beginner skills

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,130
and that was super inspiring to them and

00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,780
inspiring to us and boosting their

00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:42,000
confidence in that way it was was a

00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:48,450
really awesome thing so being vulnerable

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:50,760
very hard very worthwhile so the next

00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:52,920
hint is to go ahead and set improvements

00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:55,290
so we finished the hackathon and we were

00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,420
like they enjoyed it it was successful

00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:59,700
they went away and I think we definitely

00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:02,130
had girls who were like how do I learn

00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,450
more so from our perspective it was you

00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:06,690
know we got done what we needed to get

00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:09,630
done but you know we went home we

00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:11,040
crashed on my porch and all of us and we

00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,630
started talking about the fact that we'd

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,450
like to do it again and we'd like to do

00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:17,190
it even better so that is to say you

00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:19,500
know if you're not feeling like you're

00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:21,570
where you should be make it like your

00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,730
code a continuous refactoring cycle and

00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:27,360
the factory cycle starts with figuring

00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:29,630
out what's wrong so you know try and

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,980
make it specific to you and your project

00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:35,460
for us we needed to make it more

00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,810
accessible it was even as simplified as

00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:40,200
we had made it it could have been

00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:42,180
simpler really late at night you know

00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,980
it's 10 o'clock at night and there were

00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,440
10 year-olds and there was pizza and

00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:49,410
dancing and you know it could get

00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,970
simpler so but they did the command line

00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,910
which is also really cool I wish I could

00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:56,220
say that the command line at 10:00 but

00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:57,600
yeah and then redirecting parents maybe

00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,890
experimenting more with pair programming

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,230
the younger ones did this on their own

00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:03,240
anyways and we thought it was great

00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,850
another thing is we realized that you

00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,470
know we at the University of Texas have

00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:09,420
like a little perspective on the world

00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,670
but you all have all different

00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,110
perspectives so if you are looking for

00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:17,929
something to do you could help us make

00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:25,470
the tutorial better any hint and yep

00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:27,720
yep okay so hint 8 is to react refactor

00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:30,000
this is a part of natural coding it

00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,559
would obviously be a part of whatever it

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,860
is that you decide to build make or

00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:36,600
implement for your community so we

00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,240
decided that we need to practice more

00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,769
everybody should practice more we also

00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,600
know that you should always be looking

00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:45,870
to simplify that's the same as coding

00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:49,110
keep it simple keep making it simple and

00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:50,880
again feedback get as much feedback as

00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:53,789
you can and implement it as often as you

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,740
can our takeaways were basically more

00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:57,450
milestones and more affirmations I think

00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,610
this is a good lesson at any level

00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:02,039
keeping people engaged means letting

00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:04,380
them have lots of small wins and not

00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,970
just one big win because you don't know

00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,049
if they will have time to get to the big

00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,960
payoff

00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:11,610
so simples good simpler is better

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,500
simplest is always best and even when

00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,940
you think you have it at the most simple

00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,490
level there is always room for

00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,889
improvement in that arena and lastly

00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,360
just set their expectations what should

00:18:19,889 --> 00:18:24,149
they accomplish what should they expect

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,429
out of what you're trying to do we

00:18:24,149 --> 00:18:28,350
should have set better expectations in a

00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:29,399
lot of ways but we mainly should have

00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:32,820
probably started by introducing

00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:33,990
ourselves we didn't do that so we put a

00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,000
slide right at the beginning of this

00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:41,279
talk to make sure that we introduced

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:44,250
ourselves this time around so hit number

00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,929
9 go ahead and jump in for it and I

00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,789
would say that like this is something

00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:50,130
that I'm good at say yes say it

00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:51,840
responsibly but maybe like you know

00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,039
you're working on a project at work and

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,320
you're not you know they're like hey I

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,820
think you can do this thing you know

00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,500
they probably have a good reason to

00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,809
trust you for it trust yourself trust

00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,309
that you can you know level yourself up

00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:06,149
to get where you need to be for that

00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:07,679
project start small we didn't say we're

00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:09,960
gonna teach every kid in Austin how to

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,269
program and we just had a group of

00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,570
people who needed our help and we made

00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:17,220
ourselves available to them and then

00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:19,649
people generally want you to succeed I

00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,659
mean you know yeah basic comedy is based

00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:24,530
on unexpected failure and you know

00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:26,360
they're a house of cards he's trying to

00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,800
but that's not real life most people

00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,080
that you work with want you to succeed

00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,510
at your project they want that piece of

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,990
programming to get finished on time so

00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:38,080
you know have faith in yourself and then

00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:40,610
the other thing is is that you know

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:49,610
there is no failure I mean there is

00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:51,830
failure but there is but beyond that it

00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:54,950
leaves for us in our situation there are

00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:57,320
good moments where it's okay to fail for

00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:59,240
them you know there's this idea in

00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,430
movies there's gonna be this hacker and

00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,290
there's like five seconds and the you

00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:05,120
know and the rock is gonna come crashing

00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:06,920
down so you have a hacker and he's like

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,990
got five seconds to like get into the

00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,580
mainframe and make it work and have you

00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:13,850
ever noticed that they never hit like a

00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:16,730
null Java point exception or anything it

00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:18,890
always works like I spent most of my day

00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,960
debugging and I bet a lot of you spend a

00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:23,360
lot of your days dealing with bugs and I

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,580
think it was helpful so the girls to

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,080
realize that like debugging is part of

00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,720
it and there's no shame or nothing wrong

00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:34,430
with that as long as it's controlled and

00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:36,170
well-thought-out so to kind of start

00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:38,810
coming back full circle we did mention

00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:40,520
earlier that there were some ways that

00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:42,110
you could help and maybe if you don't

00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,390
know who it is you want to help this is

00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,800
a small non exhaustive list it's just

00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:47,540
all we could fit on the slide that might

00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:51,080
still be readable to the people in the

00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:52,610
back so there are a lot of other people

00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,050
it's just important that you find

00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:56,270
something you're passionate or curious

00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:57,830
about and then go out there and ask them

00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,450
and talk to them but see what they need

00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,950
see how you can help and see if it

00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,950
aligns with where you feel like your

00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:05,690
expertise is or where you want to go so

00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:08,990
that you kind of force yourself to level

00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:10,370
up and we'll put our slides online later

00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:15,020
so you can read these if you didn't get

00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:17,480
a chance so our last ten is that not all

00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:19,130
helping or you know getting involved

00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,500
means coding in fact I would say that

00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:24,010
probably more of helping involves not

00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,010
coding

00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,450
but for us there was somebody called

00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:31,370
Caroline and she was really helpful for

00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:33,140
us and thinking about all those things

00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:35,030
that surrounds getting this tutorial

00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,280
ready that we wouldn't necessarily have

00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:43,150
thought out like code freezes and you

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:45,440
know spelling well I know right first

00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:46,940
but the point is is there are a lot of

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,650
ways to get involved that don't involve

00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,300
writing code you have open source

00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,830
projects and they need people to you

00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:56,330
know help figure out how we're gonna

00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:58,640
design things documentation you know

00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:00,230
there's going to a soup kitchen and

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,730
actually being the person that's going

00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:05,179
to help feed people

00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:07,370
so regardless of like where you live in

00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:09,440
the coding lifecycle or if you live in

00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:11,900
it at all I would just encourage you to

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:17,420
stop waiting for somebody else to be the

00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:18,860
person yep so once more with feeling and

00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,200
to bring it all the way all the way

00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,730
around so we definitely weren't the

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,400
programmers these girls deserve we would

00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:27,440
love if the people who wrote django

00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,420
girls could come down and teach this

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,130
class for them but things like that just

00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,690
aren't realistic and they can't happen

00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:34,190
to everybody and there's much more of a

00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,170
need than there are people to fill the

00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:38,390
need so even if you don't feel like

00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:40,220
you're an expert you know something if

00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,890
as long as you were willing to put it

00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:44,240
out there you can help somebody so we

00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:45,860
ended up being the programmers these

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,050
girls needed and you guys are also

00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:50,870
really needed so we hope that we've

00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:52,130
inspired you to get out there regardless

00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,720
of whether or not you think you might be

00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,640
ready or the right person for the job

00:22:53,720 --> 00:23:00,050
and help bring people into this

00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:01,040
community so I know you were wondering

00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:08,420
this the whole time but we're not

00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:11,080
Androids mistakes so once again our

00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,080
contact information

00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:21,180
I have a quick question I have a 10 year

00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:23,190
old girl in my life and her mother has

00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,870
asked me a couple of times to teach her

00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:26,160
coding and get her interested and I've

00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:28,050
been able to get her interested in like

00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,850
some like CSS she likes to make things

00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:31,350
pretty but you're talking about a text

00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:32,850
adventure game where it's gonna be a

00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:36,450
little bit less visual so do you have

00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:39,660
any advice on how to up the enthusiasm

00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:44,580
for four things that you know don't

00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:46,440
involve sparkles yeah so we found it

00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:49,290
hope that they got to play the right

00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,690
context adventure game first and then

00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:54,030
the other thing is that we allowed them

00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:55,530
to change like the story like we allowed

00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:57,990
them to change components of the story

00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:59,610
so they were like actively creating part

00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:01,380
of what that game meant so there was a

00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:03,480
lot of the logic there but like you're

00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,190
landing a rover on Mars and then you go

00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,630
out and do different little missions so

00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:10,160
you could have like the aliens say

00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:15,660
different things and yeah

00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:15,660
