Description: 
	DjangoCon US 2017 -  The Power and Responsibility of Unicode Adoption by Katie McLaughlin

Communication is difficult. Whether between humans, machines, or a combination of the two, trying to translate meaningful information is a lossy process.

Converting programming languages to use the new Unicode standard is hard, but once itâ€™s in place, you get this marvelous feature-add: emoji compatibility. No longer do we have to make faces with symbols or use platform-specific emoticons. Rejoice in the extended character set.

Emoji have a rich history as a way to allow the communication of ideas in a reduced amount of data. They date back to a time where this was important: SMS communications in Japan. However, as social networks feverishly try to clamber onto this bandwagon, their implementations of the standard create issues with miscommunication that arenâ€™t possible with a 12Ã—12 pictograph.

Weâ€™ll discuss the history of emoji, cross-platform adoption, the Unicode standard, and emoji accessibility in web applications.

[Music]

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,900
I first gave this talk for the first

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,279
time at Jenga con Europe in Budapest and

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,770
this is probably the last time I'm gonna

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,079
give it at a Django con in the US and

00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:27,539
that's kind of freaking cool

00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:34,550
also I do acknowledge that there is an

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:36,809
emerging movie please don't see it

00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,890
three three little characters aren't

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:42,300
even actual emoji

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,360
oh my god okay that's done okay so we

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,280
are all going to look over this side now

00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,790
the official emoji for the conference by

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,040
the way the Evergreen the unicorn and

00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:56,489
Yeley horn because conference okay great

00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,960
hi I'm Katie um my twitter handle is

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,089
hidden somewhere on this slide if you'd

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,680
like to tweet me during the talk I can't

00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:03,269
reply to you during the talk but I will

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,309
endeavour to reply to you after the talk

00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:08,189
and I will be taking questions in the

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:15,740
corridor after the talk yay it's yellow

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:21,150
okay great so hi I love emoji I love how

00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:23,940
broken it is because oh my gosh so till

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,920
the app because computers we have this

00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,620
thing called Unicode Unicode is great

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,080
you should all be using Unicode you

00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:39,990
normally see Unicode in the form of say

00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:41,880
utf-32 or utf-8 utf-16 oft where if you

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,710
want to represent the character a using

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,930
utf-8 you have a string of ones and

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,360
zeros but if you wanted to represent the

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,040
character ah you just use a couple more

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,620
ones and zeros so you can use more or

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,420
less and you can have all this data

00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,729
saved because it's a flexible encoding

00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,900
system it's all great the ones and zeros

00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:59,700
are really hard to type out all the time

00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,520
so we normally just use this sort of

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:06,090
shorthand syntax this particular code is

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,440
a and this particular Unicode code will

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,509
work on every single machine that

00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,129
supports Unicode so you can send data

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,860
from one machine to another and get it

00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:15,989
back and it'll be great and you can also

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,019
do it for cool languages like Japanese

00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:21,180
and have an A as well and you can do

00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:22,980
cool stuff where you have say e and then

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,660
you add an accent and you put together

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,220
and it's an accent

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,580
and that's really great because it means

00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:32,130
that with Unicode you can encode every

00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:36,650
single language character set in the

00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:39,270
world mostly except for Japanese I

00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,730
mentioned Japanese earlier haha see

00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:45,090
thing is Unicode back in the day did

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:49,320
hiragana katakana kanji what it didn't

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:53,010
do was emoji so back in the dawn of time

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:56,790
in the 1990s the Japanese had pages who

00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:58,590
remembers what pages are their pages

00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,770
were cool because they had little

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,960
characters on them all these really cool

00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,450
little twelve pixel by twelve pixel

00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:09,720
characters were created by one of the

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:11,910
mobile phone networks so you could text

00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,550
in and say like cinema and it would go

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:16,980
cinema or zoo and would go zoo with

00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:19,020
penguin and it was really cool and was a

00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,130
great engagement strategy for the

00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:23,640
different networks and this was back in

00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:26,940
the 90s but this was all in Japan and

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,890
nowhere else so oh and there was also

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,990
this small problem where there are three

00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,930
major mobile networks they all had their

00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:35,160
own encoding and they didn't match so if

00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:39,570
you send a horse to your friend it may

00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:42,030
come up as like a pig anyway uhm then

00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:44,070
consolidated all this in the early 2000s

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,510
and was really great because once they

00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:48,210
got all their act together they could go

00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:50,130
to the Unicode consortium which is a

00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,750
wonderful group of people that would

00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:55,230
make a much more better movie than the

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:57,060
actual emoji movie and they with a

00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:00,330
little help from Google back in Unicode

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:03,900
version six in 2007 encoded all these

00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:07,260
emoji into Unicode and nothing happened

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:12,270
until Apple came along who knows what

00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:15,720
Apple is who had an apple iOS for five

00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:20,970
Feraud back in the day I'm talking 2010

00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:22,710
yeah yeah so story goes Apple was trying

00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,870
to break into the Japanese market so

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,820
they did all their phones like here is

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,530
our phone it is very cool look at it and

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:32,280
the Japanese were like but there's no

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:34,500
emoji so Apple put emoji in the very

00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,300
early iOS version to version three

00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,280
phones and that was great because the

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,380
Japanese are like yay emoji

00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,230
and then apples like we should add this

00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,600
to everyone so about iOS version five

00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:47,040
emoji get added into the US version as

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,570
the optional setting deep in the

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,660
settings we had to enable it as a

00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,770
keyboard option story goes that one day

00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,340
somebody was playing around with their

00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:59,280
phone look did it when huh I can send a

00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,930
picture of poop to my friends and so

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,470
they sent the picture Boop and someone

00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:10,230
else is like what and then it spreads as

00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:11,640
poop does um and so adoption of emoji in

00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:14,280
the Western world skyrockets and

00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,800
everyone loves emoji and the Unicode

00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,340
consortium starts adding more emoji such

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:24,419
as in 2014 we get such wonderful

00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:27,419
emerging as a chipmunk and star trek and

00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:34,130
also in the bottom right there are men

00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:36,720
in business suit who remembers wingdings

00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:39,030
backwards compatibility as a thing if

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,280
you happen to have a fault that is kind

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,620
of popular and you add a character in

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,310
there just because then you'll end up in

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,919
Unicode it's apparently a representation

00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:52,530
of the developers our favorite ska band

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,270
album and so we have made a business

00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:57,810
suit levitating because of course we do

00:05:54,270 --> 00:06:00,390
um and every year since 2014 we get new

00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,910
emoji characters we get wonderful things

00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:05,190
such as our unicorn only a couple years

00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:11,030
ago now our Australian smiley which is

00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:13,289
very useful and Parker because Tucker

00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:16,350
and just last year we've got a whole

00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:19,919
nother set included cowboy emoji duck

00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:22,190
owl spoon and egg so now you know which

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,190
came first

00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:28,160
of particular note the one in the bottom

00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,740
right corner here again is a combination

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,890
of characters it is the facepalm

00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:36,290
character and a fitzpatrick modifier to

00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:39,710
give the skin tone this means that we

00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:42,050
can have more characters that we can

00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:47,210
create based on the existing code points

00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:49,790
we have so say for hair cut in most of

00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:51,110
the most updated mobile phone keyboards

00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,570
you have when you type that character

00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,910
you're actually getting person with

00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:57,590
haircut and then female gender modifier

00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:59,780
so it's actually two separate characters

00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:01,760
which means that if you change it to a

00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:05,240
male modifier and put them back together

00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:07,220
you get man getting haircut which means

00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,680
you can have wonderful combinations like

00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:14,090
this combination which when you split it

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:17,360
out is actually man laughs man this is

00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:19,730
where the emoji tax comes in because

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,350
they may have been a medium article

00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:24,910
released in the last couple of hours

00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:27,740
saying that a whole bunch of female

00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:30,340
emoji and different color skin emoji

00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:32,450
takes up more characters this is why

00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,310
this really doesn't normally matter

00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:35,480
except for text and Twitter where you're

00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,970
limited to the amount of characters you

00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,560
can use but the fact that you can have

00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,910
these and the fact that everyone can get

00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,410
them and share them around all the

00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:45,590
different computers means that's really

00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:46,190
cool and we can also get flags which is

00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,669
really great

00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,990
so who recognizes this flag yep this

00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:53,480
flag is made up of two separate

00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:56,210
characters these two separate characters

00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:59,210
are U and s you put them together and

00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:01,910
you get a flag are using all the iso

00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:03,500
standard country codes you can get all

00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:05,480
the different iso standard country code

00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:09,890
flags just by combining the two

00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:12,470
characters so in python we can play a

00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:14,960
lot of fun stuff with emoji but only if

00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:18,640
you're using Python 3 you should use

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,640
Python 3 it supports emoji

00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:25,080
in Python 3 if you import Unicode data

00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,670
and then you can give it a single

00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,280
character and return the name for you

00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,870
you can also use escape characters with

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,660
that actual name to return back the

00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:36,120
emoji and you can do the same with those

00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:37,320
codes that we saw earlier uppercase u in

00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,030
this case means you're always going to

00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:44,340
give it eight numbers so strict Unicode

00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:48,300
32 the lowercase U that I've been using

00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:50,160
is for utf-8 so we can have a snake and

00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,570
we can unicode escape it and we can get

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,270
a byte string with its specific

00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:56,580
character point and we can move it back

00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:58,650
again which is great because Python

00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,270
supports the emoji and Apple supports

00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:03,510
emoji and this is where it gets

00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:05,100
interesting um so you remember how I

00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,020
mentioned that Apple were the first ones

00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,220
to do it and everyone was like oh I can

00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,940
poop I can see poop

00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:14,520
um Android is the thing Android didn't

00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:17,820
have emoji and so they may have rushed

00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:21,630
it a little bit which is why we get some

00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:26,580
interesting things in Android emoji this

00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:30,150
is a yellow heart it is yellow it is

00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:32,520
represented as yellow thing is in the

00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:36,660
Unicode standard they use black and

00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:39,180
white this particular pattern dates back

00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,460
to British Harold E shields and this

00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:45,510
particular sequence of dots means gold

00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:52,830
or yellow this is a yellow heart this is

00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:54,630
yellow yellow yellow this is what

00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:58,100
Android did the first time they

00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:58,100
introduced color emoji

00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:11,130
yeah but doesn't stop there

00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:14,370
this is a flushed face from Apple

00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:16,860
Twitter emoji one and Google Android

00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,390
Google Android Android Google every

00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,000
single one except for the Android one

00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:25,320
looks like a oh no what did I do

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,300
but the Google one looks like a Oh which

00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,160
can have really fun when you're sending

00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:32,670
one to a friend that's got Apple and

00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:38,459
your your context gets lost um oh it

00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:39,140
doesn't stop there okay this is jazz

00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:42,930
hands

00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:44,940
yeah this is hugging

00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:49,080
jazz hands hugging these are all the

00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:51,650
same character oh but doesn't stop there

00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:55,740
when you clap

00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,740
[Laughter]

00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:04,570
the one on the end is Windows I'm not

00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,430
sure how long we can actually do that

00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:11,980
before the back of your hand starts to

00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:14,020
really hurt oh but it doesn't stop there

00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:24,430
who wants to take a guess what this

00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:26,230
character is blonde there's entire

00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:28,120
scientific papers that go through and

00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,740
work out the fact that yes this is a

00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,130
thing and it's not just something I

00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:36,280
noticed um this is grinning verse

00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:40,810
grimace the only difference is the eyes

00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:42,190
and given emoji started in Japan back in

00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,170
the back of the back of the day this

00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:45,820
makes sense in Japanese culture because

00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,980
Japanese culture has a whole great big

00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:50,740
thing about the eyes in manga and anime

00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,630
as a westerner they look the same to me

00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:54,130
which means that if somebody sends me

00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:59,140
one in the other I have no idea what's

00:11:54,130 --> 00:12:01,390
going on so we have a lot of emoji we

00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:05,140
get emoji every year how do we actually

00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:07,300
get new emoji the Unicode consortium the

00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:10,480
savage arbiter of the sappy Oaks Arirang

00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,850
talk um there are a whole bunch of do's

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,220
and don'ts if you want to get an emoji

00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,960
added but is up for public submission

00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,850
you just submit a form with all the

00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,650
right things in it and they will take

00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,630
your consideration under take your

00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:25,180
request under consideration things that

00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:28,180
will get you added if you're talking

00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:31,930
about improving compatibility across

00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:35,850
platforms who recognizes the emoticons

00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,850
at the top there where are they from

00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:42,460
Yahoo Messenger the only reason we have

00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,640
a cowboy emoji is because yahoo

00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:50,620
messenger had a cowboy um

00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:53,710
completeness is also a factor up until

00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,660
unicode 7 they didn't have characters to

00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:58,390
every single zodiac sign so that's why

00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,250
they added scorpion and the rest because

00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,810
zodiac is apparently a thing that people

00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,420
care about um

00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:07,089
frequently requested as well when you

00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:09,910
get entire chains that make tacos asking

00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:11,590
for a taco emoji you'll get a taco

00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:14,580
but also unicorns so that's kind of cool

00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:18,010
um things that don't count

00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:19,570
overly specific there is a snow cone

00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,580
there is a soft-serve and there is an

00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:23,740
ice cream sundae emoji we're not going

00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:26,800
to get a banana split emoji anytime soon

00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:28,690
I'm sorry also you can never never never

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,950
never never never never have any logos

00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:35,470
or brands these are the Apple renditions

00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:39,100
that look like Apple products because

00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:44,320
Apple Apple Apple Apple Apple Apple

00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:46,350
Apple Apple also no fans or memes which

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,750
means we can never get a Star Trek emoji

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:52,210
there was a Star Trek emoji earlier

00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:54,430
anyway um as we bring in new emoji older

00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:57,610
systems get out of date and then we get

00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:59,560
this wonderful issue of the replacement

00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:03,550
character which is when the computer

00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:05,440
goes also known as moji bucket in

00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,180
Japanese or mochi baked because I'm a

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,190
westerner and I bastardize any pronounce

00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,830
the pronunciation of anything including

00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:13,720
my own language apparently um if you

00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:16,000
don't have a phone that's up-to-date

00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,980
enough you can end up getting missed

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,530
characters and so you can't see the

00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:22,180
Australian smiley and it's really sad um

00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:25,510
but it's okay because there's an app for

00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:29,530
that now a wonderful Gentile of Sydney

00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:31,570
has made a emoji sensor app which means

00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:34,060
that if you put it on Chrome or now

00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:35,740
Firefox if you were to take a completely

00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,240
random tweet that I did not generate

00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,900
specifically for the purposes of this

00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:44,470
talk and make it so every single emoji

00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:47,620
doesn't exist it starts reading really

00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:49,990
rude and this is also a reason why you

00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:52,810
shouldn't use emoji in line because you

00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:54,580
end up seeming like you're saying silly

00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,780
things on the internet and you really

00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:00,250
shouldn't say silly things on the

00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:01,690
Internet um one thing where it does work

00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:06,210
there emergent you will most definitely

00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:09,910
work is URLs this is a real website

00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:10,390
spoon emoji OWS is a website that I've

00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:15,820
created

00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:18,339
it cost me 22 cents because ws but it

00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:20,800
refers to spoon emoji and spoon theory

00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:22,270
which is a mental health thing about

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,200
having enough spoons in your day to be

00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:26,100
able to do things

00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,450
um there is an entire RFC which

00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,090
determines exactly how you get from

00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:34,030
arbitrary Neko characters into Latin

00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:37,000
characters and back again so this is the

00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:39,940
actual URL of that website but if you go

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,530
to that URL depending on your browser it

00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:46,810
will change it into a spoon emoji

00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:51,070
browsers and emoji have some interesting

00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:55,570
eccentricities speaking of which our

00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:58,810
browser tabs um you can't have emoji in

00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:01,720
the title of your website you can also

00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:03,520
have emoji that make your title of your

00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:08,260
website look like it's secure because

00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:09,250
there is a padlock emoji except in

00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,650
Safari

00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:15,430
they don't render that if you look

00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:18,520
closely here the other two tabs in this

00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:20,740
Safari view have the emoji that's being

00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:23,530
represented and then the name of it but

00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:25,390
the lock emoji isn't there this only

00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:28,780
happens at the moment in Safari which

00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:30,130
means that your terrible terrible

00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,190
website that wants to get information

00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:34,300
out of helpless people can't actually

00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:36,340
look like a secure website

00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:39,900
unless you're actually secure by the way

00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:42,940
let's encrypt exists now um anyway so

00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:44,140
how do you get emerging into things with

00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,480
the keyboard because that's how you

00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:50,020
normally input stuff although as of

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:54,520
yesterday Google Voice now supports

00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:56,290
emoji dictation I'm sorry um but on on

00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,540
device has been actual keyboards you

00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:01,330
normally see our button like this say on

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:04,270
Android and then you get Android emoji

00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:07,540
which is all very blobby and cute if

00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:11,079
you're on iOS there's like a smiley face

00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:12,459
which is really easy but on Mac if you

00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:15,880
didn't already know you can press

00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:17,949
command control space and you bring up a

00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,810
wonderful searchable interface that

00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:21,760
allows you to search for all your emoji

00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:24,190
which is really great and I'm seeing a

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:28,000
number of Mac's in the room so now you

00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:30,340
know um or if you don't want to rely on

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,840
soft keyboards you can always just

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,270
connect together fourteen hardware

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,980
keyboards one for every single emoji

00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:38,160
character

00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:40,470
like a gentleman called Tom Scott did so

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,440
fourteen mechanical keyboards may be as

00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:45,150
big as this stage but already that's now

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,240
out of date because there's several more

00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:49,710
emoji characters this is about the same

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,000
gentleman that made an emerging only

00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:54,540
network yeah you can imagine how well

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,450
that went

00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:03,560
um they had they were they were

00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:07,050
approached by venture capitalists yeah

00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:08,700
anyway webs web sites and such because

00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:11,070
there's there a web emoji and I can use

00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,840
a web abode you down this talk some

00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:15,120
websites if you want to enter in your

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,740
emoji they have wonderful little soft

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,840
paddles in there so you can search for

00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,010
your stuff say on Twitter and as of a

00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,050
couple of months ago you can actually

00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:24,630
search for emoji in Twitter you have

00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:27,600
been able to in Instagram for a while

00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:29,790
including hash tag of emoji nor the

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:36,000
eggplant emoji hashtag on Instagram does

00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:38,220
not work yeah um I'll be tweeting out a

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,290
hat Twitter tweeting out a link to these

00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,180
slides and there's entire engineering

00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:44,430
blog articles from Instagram about how

00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:46,710
they actually get hash tag emoji stuff

00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:49,830
to work because there's some really big

00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:51,390
regex they're really big um speaking of

00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,490
which if you don't want to have to try

00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:55,950
to get your soft keyboards and stuff you

00:18:53,490 --> 00:19:00,000
can always use short codes if you want

00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:03,930
to enter in cake you could have I say on

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,730
slack and on github : cake : and you get

00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:08,130
cake and this is really great when

00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:11,130
you're used to say the hardware keyboard

00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:12,750
on your laptop that doesn't have emoji

00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,850
keyboards except if you've got a touch

00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:18,540
bar now on the call max because anything

00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:20,460
in emoji keyboards um but the thing is

00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,020
that this doesn't work everywhere

00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,820
because this is a vendor specific

00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:26,220
implementation which means that say if

00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:29,070
you use HipChat you need to use brackets

00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:31,080
instead of colons and their cake doesn't

00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:33,440
equal the slack cake these are two

00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,030
completely different types of cake

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,750
one is a short cake and one is a cake

00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:44,600
cake and they're not the same um so here

00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:44,600
here is familiar with slack yes

00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:52,100
party parrot is not an emoji it is an

00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:55,070
emoticon you can add it specifically to

00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:57,260
a specific slack Network but not all

00:19:55,070 --> 00:20:00,170
slack networks you have to add it

00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:02,240
manually ship it squirrel is not an

00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:04,070
emoji this is something specific to

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,660
github you can also import it into your

00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,000
various applications that it is not

00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:10,370
globally recognized this is an emerging

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,460
on this has been a public service

00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:14,900
announcement by me um if you're going to

00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,730
be using short codes in your system

00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:20,900
please for the love of all things nice

00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:22,340
let me disable auto correct I don't know

00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,070
how many times I've tried to put paste

00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:30,650
in ipv6 codes and it automatically

00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:33,710
corrects to like also single colon and

00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:37,310
bracket is a smiley not a super hyped up

00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:40,880
smiley eyes smiley with teeth showing um

00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:44,210
and if I'm embarrassed I really don't

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,950
think I'm vomiting money especially

00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,810
because I'm Australian and our money

00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:50,450
normally is in green except for the

00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:53,090
really big ones actually never mind the

00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:56,120
100 dollar notes a green ish so I would

00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:58,610
like to vomit that please um a note on

00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,920
slack slack does not keep their emoji up

00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:02,480
to date they have it for a couple of

00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,220
years now which means that yes you can

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,310
get chipmunk and pop home but you can't

00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:12,050
get duck unless you add it manually so

00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:12,980
people in slack I call me um reading

00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,500
things back again

00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,240
most systems if you update them will

00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:21,590
automatically do this for you based on

00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:23,240
their system platform encodings but on

00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,860
the web you have complete control so you

00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,050
can make it really nice for people that

00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,720
can't buy the newest iPhone every year

00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:31,730
to update their emoji so if I can make

00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,280
one suggestion that you take back with

00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:38,120
you today if you develop websites enable

00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:39,500
fallback please use full back images for

00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,410
any emerging you want to use in your

00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:45,920
website because you cannot rely on the

00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:48,440
system emoji being there even if you use

00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,540
agents you cannot rely on people having

00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,070
more up-to-date systems you're still

00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:54,980
going to have people that have black and

00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:56,909
white emoji on Android and context can

00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,549
be lost

00:21:56,909 --> 00:22:00,899
use fallback images it's being a

00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:03,089
fallback images the next slide is the

00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:04,649
only slide that actually has emoji on it

00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:06,989
everything else I've been using today

00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:08,309
has been full back images mostly so I

00:22:06,989 --> 00:22:11,339
can show the difference between benders

00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:13,709
but I'm on a Mac this is how emoji look

00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:16,679
on a Mac they are really really really

00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:19,349
shiny now except the new ones still

00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:21,869
don't work and some of the older unicode

00:22:19,349 --> 00:22:24,479
two and three aren't actually emojis

00:22:21,869 --> 00:22:26,609
they're the text representation if you

00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:29,009
go to this URL I have this exact thing

00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:31,489
that shows you how the different emoji

00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:34,109
actually show up on different platforms

00:22:31,489 --> 00:22:37,619
but they kind of look shiny now I guess

00:22:34,109 --> 00:22:40,049
um but if you run a website and you want

00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:41,609
to have a really easy way to enable

00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:44,839
fallback images

00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:47,639
twee emoji j/s is the Twitter

00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:50,099
implementation of fallback for just

00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:51,719
images wordpress.com now uses this by

00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:54,869
default which means that if you have a

00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:56,969
wordpress.com blog all your emoji will

00:22:54,869 --> 00:23:00,269
work for every user as long as they have

00:22:56,969 --> 00:23:03,239
images enabled which is great images and

00:23:00,269 --> 00:23:06,389
JavaScript enabled but we don't um but

00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:08,309
we can raise the bar here not only can

00:23:06,389 --> 00:23:11,309
we have image fallback but we can also

00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:14,149
do things like having highlights high

00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:19,169
lights the pumps they keep coming

00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:22,769
tooltip and mouse overs and web

00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:25,139
accessibility in general so instead of

00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:26,820
just using and defaulting to system

00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:29,519
emoji we can enable all these things

00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,559
which makes for extremely rich desktop

00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,149
experience for people who want to be

00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:35,669
able to actually see what a Mojang mean

00:23:33,149 --> 00:23:38,999
and be able to have screen dictation

00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:42,029
work so this is how you should be doing

00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:45,209
fallback images in your websites you

00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:48,659
have a source image which would be the

00:23:45,209 --> 00:23:50,929
encoding of the unicode character please

00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:53,549
don't use SVG not everyone supports SVG

00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:57,329
pngs are good enough and they also are

00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:59,039
better for a performance thing and there

00:23:57,329 --> 00:24:01,619
are a whole lot of our CD ends that will

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:04,589
give you access to cached versions of

00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:08,489
all your emoji MaxCDN I believe does

00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:09,730
Twitter but if you use the alt title and

00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:11,860
aria-label you can get one

00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:14,830
things like this because if you use alt

00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:17,139
with the actual emoji in there if you

00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:19,059
copy and paste the entire string of text

00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:21,669
which includes your image your emerging

00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:23,320
image you will copy the actual unicode

00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:25,779
character into your clipboard and then

00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,200
you can paste it again which is really

00:24:25,779 --> 00:24:28,210
cool

00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,399
also did you know that alts are

00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:32,320
different to text titles because if you

00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:34,779
have title and you mouse over it it will

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,510
tell you what the emoji is supposed to

00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:39,159
be which is great for people that need

00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:41,620
glasses to be able to read their screens

00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:43,269
and people who are over 40 and the rest

00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:46,149
of it I'm not knowing what all these

00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:47,649
little why is the owl purple I don't

00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:49,690
know what that is is it supposed to be a

00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:52,630
jumper emoji I don't know oh it's an owl

00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:54,909
that's great and also re a label for

00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:56,200
super bonus points means that when a

00:24:54,909 --> 00:24:58,750
screen reader comes across your website

00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,029
they will hear emoji owl in the middle

00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:02,889
of your string which means that they can

00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:04,269
understand your website and you want

00:25:02,889 --> 00:25:06,570
people to understand your website

00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:08,559
because understanding websites is good

00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:12,149
but it's okay because I've done all this

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:14,740
for you pip install emoji for Kate is a

00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:16,630
Django template that will automatically

00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:18,370
translate any Content that you have that

00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:20,860
includes emoji characters and translates

00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:23,830
this into the proper web accessible

00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:26,889
image fallback system so you can use it

00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:30,279
as a template tag and then passing your

00:25:26,889 --> 00:25:32,350
content through a filter or you can use

00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:34,450
the full template tag on your site and

00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:36,309
it will automatically do all this for

00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:38,320
you all the code is on github and I've

00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:39,639
got a blog post there explaining a whole

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,850
bunch of how it works

00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:45,730
um one tip for general use especially in

00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:50,370
the web world please enable utf-8 by

00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:54,309
default because by default you will have

00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:59,289
snapping fingers apparently um ASCII for

00:25:54,309 --> 00:26:01,539
which is ya know don't um anyway the

00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:03,909
future and I have minutes left minutes

00:26:01,539 --> 00:26:08,230
this is great um guess what's happening

00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:12,250
more emoji yay

00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:16,770
um such enthusiasm and then you didn't

00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:16,770
even see the Hedgehog emoji we just got

00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:25,210
broccoli emoji dumpling emoji Stephen

00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:29,440
Colbert emoji we have two dinosaurs now

00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:32,710
not just a t-rex head scarf emoji which

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,700
is wonderful and we also have some

00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:37,780
wonderful ones just in time for

00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:41,020
Halloween we also have sandwich emoji we

00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:43,120
also have zebras and pie because we

00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:46,559
haven't had a pie emoji before what's up

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,820
with that I know right

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:52,570
mind blown

00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:54,940
which is also now an emerging also some

00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:56,559
interesting things when you're say

00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,840
jet-lagged under reading through the

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:01,390
unicode spec at whatever time of date is

00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,919
and whatever time zone you are there are

00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:04,720
some really interesting little subtle

00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:06,370
changes that came in with unicode 10

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,790
including the fact that your little

00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:10,840
sweat emoji isn't supposed to be on the

00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,820
face it's supposed to be an

00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:15,700
anthropomorphic blob hovering it in

00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:20,350
front of the head so for the various

00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:22,290
vendors that are supposed to yeah for

00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:25,480
the current vendors that are currently

00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:28,090
conforming to physics get on that um

00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:31,600
also in unicode 10 which is really

00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:35,890
important to me no longer is there just

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:39,010
male and female modifiers and faces or

00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:43,720
just child adult older person there are

00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:47,500
now gender-neutral faces which means

00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:49,240
that you don't just have where you're

00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,460
not supposed to have anymore just a

00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,290
male's on being a female zombie by

00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,730
default all your characters are supposed

00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:59,860
to be gender neutral and then you add

00:27:54,730 --> 00:28:01,750
your modifiers on top but this hasn't

00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:03,640
really been implemented properly ever

00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:06,490
before because it's really new which

00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:09,160
means when you have say rock climbers

00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:11,679
the top one being Twitter the bottom one

00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:14,250
being Facebook the man on the left the

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,250
woman on the right

00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:24,010
have I run out of time in my a-v just

00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:28,350
cut off its it's exactly at time so

00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:28,350
that's a pretty spooky coincidence I

00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:33,809
don't think we planned it that way I

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:43,570
have like more slides but I can stop now

00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:58,990
no we don't like that idea do I bump

00:28:43,570 --> 00:29:01,169
something up here baby how how do I do

00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:01,169
that

00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:07,270
hang tight everybody

00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:09,130
you know there is now not just the

00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:11,140
default woman dancing emoji there is a

00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:12,820
man dancing emoji which looks all like

00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:18,330
Saturday Night Fever so yes there is a

00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:20,500
rustle emoji now you're welcome

00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:25,210
would you like to hear my review of the

00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:27,250
emoji movie while we wait okay anyone

00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:36,220
who doesn't want spoilers cover their

00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:38,110
ears now wait one of the main plot

00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:39,820
points in the emoji movie is that they

00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:44,710
have to get to the Dropbox app to get on

00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:51,220
the cloud we have it on one side yeah

00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:53,340
okay as we continue um these are the new

00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:55,750
rock-climbing emoji for male and female

00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:57,190
what you're supposed to do is any

00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,919
character that doesn't have a specific

00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:01,840
modifier supposed to be gender-neutral

00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:03,250
the problem is that on Twitter at the

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,470
moment gender neutral for rock climbing

00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:07,240
it looks like a man and on Facebook the

00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,049
gender neutral for rock climbing emoji

00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,240
looks like a woman

00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:13,330
hopefully vendors will fix this stuff

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,529
and I nearly swore then because it's

00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:16,299
really annoying when you want to

00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:20,110
represent yourself and you have no idea

00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:23,350
how the emoji is going to look so get on

00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:25,539
that other updates and the wonderful

00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:28,030
issue before of the grimacing face has

00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:30,360
now been fixed in Apple

00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:31,840
so now the grimace actually looks like

00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,640
this sorry

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,020
that is the grinning face in different

00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,060
versions of Apple it no longer looks

00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:38,320
like Remy so now looks like grinning so

00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:41,580
you no longer think that somebody's

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:45,130
really upset at you um

00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:47,200
Android has also fixed their different

00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:49,090
emoji so this is the same flushed face

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:53,400
from earlier in different versions so

00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:53,400
it's gone from noir to earth-2 duck

00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:57,880
although the elephant in the room

00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,320
there has been an elephant emoji in

00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,690
there for several years by the way but

00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:05,740
the actual elephant in the room this is

00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:09,820
the grinning emoji from Android 7 and

00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:11,920
then the Android o beta they have

00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:14,500
reverted their grinning emoji into the

00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:16,960
old format they have also apparently

00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:19,480
taken an intern and a free version of

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:25,090
Photoshop with gradients and recreated

00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:28,990
all their emoji anthropomorphic orange

00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:31,060
yellow orange yellowish blobs I thought

00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:36,400
these were perfectly fine the new

00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:38,290
versions hurt my eyes I mean I don't

00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:41,320
know whether this is an accessibility

00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:42,880
thing or not but I don't want to upgrade

00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:45,400
my phone if it means I'm gonna have to

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,020
look at that all day which is really bad

00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,240
coming from me cuz I'm like a security

00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:52,810
nut and I really like having updates on

00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:56,320
my phone so my phone is secure but it's

00:31:52,810 --> 00:32:00,520
ok because on Android phones going back

00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:02,320
to 2013 versions there is going to be an

00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:04,600
emoji support library Edition which

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,940
means that apps don't have to rely on

00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:09,130
system emoji they can download the emoji

00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:11,050
font for Android and replace in all

00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:13,390
their emoji which means that you know no

00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:14,920
longer get mochi bucket the problem is

00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:20,530
it's all the new terrible-looking emoji

00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:24,070
so yeah um who uses Windows your Windows

00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:26,200
emoji got awesome the new Windows 10

00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:28,870
emoji look freakin amazing

00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,600
there's like pop art and they no longer

00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:35,859
look like the end of a banana and it's

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:40,580
great and they fixed the clapping emoji

00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:42,769
also also Windows is the first platform

00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:48,289
to support interracial inter-gender

00:32:42,769 --> 00:32:49,909
couples yes and if you click the windows

00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:53,029
button and period you get your own

00:32:49,909 --> 00:32:57,289
search button now that's cool

00:32:53,029 --> 00:33:00,909
Linux get on this um emoji one have also

00:32:57,289 --> 00:33:04,340
had a recent update crowdfunded of

00:33:00,909 --> 00:33:07,639
freemium platform so now all their emoji

00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:09,919
are really shiny and it's cool as a

00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:11,599
point this is the first version of emoji

00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:14,149
you could get in a sufficiently

00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:15,889
open-source license and was all

00:33:14,149 --> 00:33:17,779
kick-started and they're really cool and

00:33:15,889 --> 00:33:20,090
they like my tweets I'm hurrying up and

00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:23,539
the owl no longer looks like it's got an

00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:26,989
Argyle jumper on and there are also

00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:28,729
professions so you can have an emoji

00:33:26,989 --> 00:33:34,879
that looks like you because this emoji

00:33:28,729 --> 00:33:36,799
looks like me and new things that are

00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:38,269
coming um there are a whole bunch of

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,769
emoji that have been suggested to be

00:33:38,269 --> 00:33:42,409
implemented for next year including

00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:45,649
cupcake emoji including teddy bear emoji

00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:48,679
and including all those horrible feeling

00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:50,960
emoji from Facebook um but you don't

00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:53,899
have to rely on the emoji consortium

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,639
emoji consortium Unicode consortium you

00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:57,979

emoji if you want to including and

00:33:57,979 --> 00:34:02,899
wonderful multicolored hearts and you

00:34:00,649 --> 00:34:04,519
could say have your banana and your

00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:07,489
sundae and makeup and under sundae or

00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:09,799
you could have your chimp your chipmunk

00:34:07,489 --> 00:34:13,069
and your hat and have a hat and have a

00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:14,720
ship it thing or well okay you can't

00:34:13,069 --> 00:34:17,000

00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,179
welcome

00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:26,359
as of last week party part has been

00:34:24,589 --> 00:34:30,490
recommended to be added to the Unicode

00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:30,490
standard next year you're welcome

00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:41,520
but there is now a new exclusion

00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:44,290
parameter that may be because of the

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,180
exclusion factor que falta comparison

00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,770
the emoji dog and poodle and two

00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:49,540
different types of camel do not justify

00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:52,210
adding different varieties of the same

00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:55,180
kind of animal I'm sorry I broke emoji

00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:56,500
for you anyway if you want to know not

00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:59,290
more information you can look up

00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:02,020
Wikipedia emoji PDA org which is a

00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:04,600
wonderful website there's also the fake

00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:07,240
Unicode consortium who may or may not be

00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,380
an Aussie I'm not actually sure you

00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,700
should also tweet them because they

00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:11,560
really hate any time I mentioned them in

00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:14,220
talks there's also the Unicode

00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:16,840
consortium on Twitter and you can also

00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,860
adopt an emoji to give the money to help

00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,930
with all the wonderful things that

00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:21,940
they're doing but doesn't include things

00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:25,090
that aren't emoji including making sure

00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:28,000
that like indigenous written texts can

00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:31,180
be encoded in unicode so quickly some

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,580
takeaways yes

00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:36,520
one last groan um there's a lot of power

00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:38,500
in speech emoji add an additional level

00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,150
of communication but there's a whole

00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:42,460
bunch of responsibilities in the

00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:44,860
implementation and accessibility that we

00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:47,860
need to as web devs be aware of but

00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:48,930
remember to have fun thank you for your

00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:56,189
time
