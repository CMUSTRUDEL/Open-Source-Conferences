[Music]

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:26,410
all right hello Jango Khan family we're

00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,989
here to close out our tenth Jenga con us

00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,070
and some of you may know from a talk I

00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:31,570
gave a couple of years ago I'm an

00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,940
English major I could not figure out the

00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:36,460
proper way to pluralize Jango Khan USS

00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,560
so we're just gonna go with that and

00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,899
call that good you can tweet me a

00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,700
correction if you get that but given

00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:44,170
that this is the tenth Jango Khan us I

00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,440
thought it would be a little bit fun to

00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:50,380
take a trip down memory lane to prior

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,840
Gengo Khan's in the United States so if

00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,520
we go back to 2008 we can see on the the

00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,850
Django project vlog the announcement

00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,900
that there there will be a django con us

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,820
over the past couple of months we found

00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,250
volunteers who taken on the task of

00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,689
planning a django con and again as an

00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,220
English major I really appreciate the

00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:09,759
quotes like we weren't really sure what

00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:12,340
this was going to be yet and then

00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:14,770
unfortunately the the website for the

00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:18,130
2008 django con has not it's CSS has not

00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:19,780
survived its content has survived this

00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:22,329
is all we have I looked in like web

00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,909
archive you know Jeff helmed we were not

00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:26,740
able to find a better thing than this

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:28,240
however there is a project going on

00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,189
right now where we're trying to restore

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,939
the old websites of prior Django Khan's

00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:36,009
prior Django con europe's so if you

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,719
would like a sprint project you can you

00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:39,689
know chat about that at the sprints

00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:42,340
that's a wonderful thing that you can do

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,439
there's been some wonderful blog posts

00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,569
that i've again web archive and and

00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:48,819
google and very kind people on twitter

00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:50,229
have have led me different places so

00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:51,639
Bravo Charette who I think that many of

00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:54,729
you know and who's not able to be here

00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:56,499
this year wrote about her excitement

00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:58,810
about being able to attend the very

00:01:56,499 --> 00:02:00,579
first django con us and she said I was

00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,469
up at four freaking thirty this morning

00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:04,119
on the off chance that I might be able

00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:06,039
to get in on the first round of django

00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:08,350
con tickets I believe that that first

00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:10,420
year they were free and from what

00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,370
Barbara says on her blog that it was a

00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,150
good thing she was up at 4:30 because by

00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,340
4:45

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,880
the website was erroring because so many

00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:20,620
people were trying to get those tickets

00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,330
the very first django con us was hosted

00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,950
in Mountain View California at the

00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,960
Google headquarters and so this is what

00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,740
that then you looked like and thank you

00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,360
James for

00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,710
your links to some photos I'm using your

00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,950
photos pretty heavily along with a lot

00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:34,840
of others there's this is a picture of a

00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,610
panel I think this is the core dev team

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,410
and let me see here

00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,850
so yeah pictured here is Adrienne

00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,070
hollow-body James Bennett

00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:43,710
Simon Willison Jacob Kaplan Moss Russell

00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:46,210
Keith Magee and Malcolm tread Nick

00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,760
several of whom are with us here today

00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:50,650
and one of the keynotes that year was

00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,120
given by a man named Cal Henderson and

00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,040
one of the lovely things in that keynote

00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,540
that I learned is that in 2008 the

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,320
website on the internet with the most

00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,490
traffic was Yahoo one of the other

00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,600
things that I found whenever I was

00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,180
looking at the old Django kind of

00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,620
websites is the the number of keynotes

00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,990
in the way that keynotes are described

00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,240
has varied tremendously throughout the

00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:12,730
years so for that very first Django con

00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,020
we had five keynotes it was a two-day

00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,520
conference it was supposed to be to

00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,350
track but I feel like you can only call

00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,230
it about one and a half track because so

00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:22,540
much time was spent in keynotes those

00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,940
keynotes were given by Robert Lofthouse

00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,430
cuido van Rossum Cal Henderson mark

00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,350
Graham and then Adrian and Jakob Kaplan

00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,570
masa did a joint keynote together so six

00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,010
speakers five presentations and then

00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,990
here they are I just wanted you to know

00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,960
how much of the schedule was taken up by

00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:39,010
keynotes

00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,200
people were pretty excited about the

00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,510
first ring of con us Eric florins on o

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,520
who gave a keynote in a later year said

00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,650
Jago con great conference or greatest

00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,840
conference ever I think we know the

00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,220
answer to that

00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,610
also Brian Veloso wrote a blog post

00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,900
where he he says that inspired by

00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,700
something in Cal Henderson's first

00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:01,150
keynote at the Jing of Khan in 20 in

00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,920
2008 he said Django needed a mascot one

00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,530
that was awesome and had magical powers

00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,560
where somewhere in my well somewhere in

00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:13,750
my head I agreed and that's how we got

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:16,780
the Django Pony in 2009 Django Khan was

00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,100
hosted in Portland Oregon we were down

00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,430
to a more respectable keynote count of

00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,959
three

00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,780
those key notes were given by Auggie

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,240
Bryant even e'en picking and Ted lung

00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:28,430
and I was looking through the schedule

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,169
today actually before I came to see

00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,520
Russell's talk this afternoon and I

00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,139
noticed that he sort of broke some sort

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,320
of space-time thing he apparently was

00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:40,280
giving two simultaneous talks between

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,990
255 and 355 Russell gave no bad pony and

00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,180
also getting the most out of the test

00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:47,900
client I would really like to hear how

00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:49,910
that feat was accomplished in 2009

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,160
Django was also featured in wired wired

00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:54,590
referred to Django as our favorite web

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,660
development Frank framework so wired

00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,740
talked about Django and also Django Khan

00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,169
it's pretty exciting

00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,780
and here's another panel this one

00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:05,930
features justin braun joseph cooker hogs

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:08,800
my President James Bennett Russell Keith

00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:11,690
McGee Simon Wilson and Brian roster oh

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,780
and also the pony and also it cannot

00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:16,699
forget the pony thank you I also do want

00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,860
to mention that the precursor to Django

00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:22,039
con Europe euro Django con was

00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,389
introduced in 2009 I was this is where

00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:25,250
the Internet Archive failed me I was

00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:28,070
unable to find anything but the lanyard

00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,690
website for that but this is you know

00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,669
part of the project restoration so if

00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:34,580
that one exists in some data that's

00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:37,880
something you can work on 2010 brought

00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:41,300
us back to Portland and then we have a

00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,949
keynote mystery there were a couple of

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,199
doubletrack talks that were not tagged

00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:47,479
as keynotes

00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:49,220
there is a keynote slot on the schedule

00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:51,889
and then there is a distinguished guest

00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,030
on the schedule in the blog and also on

00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:56,530
the schedule those names are never

00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,530
mentioned I've no idea who they were so

00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,010
rest of those indicating that it is good

00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,620
that this has been wiped from the from

00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:05,479
the internet history so yes miss

00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:09,340
mysteries that we won't go into you

00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:12,139
while I'm on stage anyway bar later

00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:14,150
Daniel Roy Greenfeld said the conference

00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:15,949
was like a family gathering and that's

00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,030
something that I'm I was I was really

00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:18,500
proud to hear that several of our

00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,659
attendees say that to me and to our

00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,039
other organizers so I feel very proud

00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:25,690
that we've been able to keep that spirit

00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:28,039
of family alive since at least 2010

00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,750
Scott hacker also said that this Jenga

00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:31,969
con brought several surprises from a

00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,050
pony in the swag bag to the discovery

00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:34,370
that you could get full two

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,099
point of bursting at a vegan restaurant

00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,810
I live in Portland so I'm proud to see

00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:41,509
that vegan Portland food is is treating

00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:44,930
people right and was in 2010 and here's

00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:46,699
a photo of Russell with a I believe that

00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,110
that's a Django con hat that was the

00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:50,300
swag that year and then also a large

00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,620
Python and the pony I do wonder is this

00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,069
the pony that appeared in all of the

00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,360
swag bags no oh no yeah that would that

00:06:55,069 --> 00:07:00,169
would be damned impressive I will say

00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:02,060
that 2011 continues the tradition of

00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:03,379
jeguk on being in Portland we were

00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,509
really excited about Portland there for

00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:08,960
a few years we were back to five

00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:11,300
keynotes David Yves Russell Keith Magee

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,460
Brad Fitzpatrick Eden Gazette and glyph

00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,199
Lefkowitz where our keynote speakers

00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,789
that year and Daniel Kahn used to have

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,500
this tradition where we gave a couple

00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:20,389
organs they at the time I wasn't

00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:23,659
involved gave a couple of keynote slots

00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:25,099
to a Django be DFL or to the DSF to give

00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:26,719
a keynote so that kind of explains the

00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:29,000
extra keynotes a little bit but I still

00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:33,530
think it's funny but that year we also

00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,539
had a bonus session a fireside chat and

00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:37,550
that was with Abbey DFL but that P DFL

00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:41,270
is unnamed so again another Jenga con

00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:43,190
history mystery that's the year that PI

00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,509
ladies also organize themselves and came

00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,279
to Django con if you look through the

00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:46,699
jinguk on schedules for the first few

00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:48,139
years

00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,759
you noticed that while there were some

00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:52,639
amazing talks by some wonderful speakers

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,370
those speakers were largely men and in

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,529
2011 the pie ladies decided to organize

00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,759
and they wrote a blog post about how

00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:01,460
they were encouraging women to speak

00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:03,469
they had workshops they encouraged women

00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,090
to submit talks and the result was

00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:07,159
amazing the result was that that year

00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:10,190
there were five women speakers at django

00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:12,289
con us and also one of those speakers

00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:14,800
was our keynote speaker from today Tracy

00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:14,800
Osborn

00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,710
the pilotis also helped out at a

00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:25,680
tutorial and then yes like I said they

00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:27,360
gave five talks but that year we still

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,100
had no code of conduct at jingo con when

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,600
you look back through the early jinguk

00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,310
on schedules code of codes of conduct

00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,020
weren't really a thing yet so I I

00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,160
noticed this I was wondering when was

00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,640
the year that the code of conduct was

00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,169
introduced so then we bring to 2012

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,580
where we were no longer in Portland

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:42,960
finally we went somewhere else somewhere

00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,120
other than the west coast we were in

00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,270
Washington DC and as a personal note

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,830
this was my very first ginger pond and

00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:51,480
we had a code of conduct at that Django

00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,460
con which made the explains why I had a

00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,760
fantastic and lovely time at that Django

00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:58,560
con the code of conduct is here but that

00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,480
was also the first year that tutorials

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,620
became part of Django con us and I

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,780
remember taking a couple of those

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,450
tutorials I've never noted Django con

00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:09,120
without tutorial so I'm very very happy

00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:10,950
that explicit learning that a deep dive

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,580
for three or three and a half hours is a

00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,750
part of what we do here at Django con

00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,670
and this was pretty funny someone wrote

00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:23,400
in a blog post this event that year in

00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:24,450
2012 had exactly 404 attendees I trust I

00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,380
don't need to explain that joke to

00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:29,520
anyone here we did have five keynotes

00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,950
again that year we were just really

00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,600
excited about a lot of keynotes Eric

00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,100
sterling Russell Keith McGee Selena

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,140
Declan so our first woman keynote

00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:40,680
speaker Adrienne Halle body and Jeff

00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:43,920
Schmidt were our speakers that year 2013

00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,390
brought us to Chicago oh and I had

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,070
intended to do something and I got kind

00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,720
of nervous whenever I got up here so I'm

00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,190
gonna stop now and I'm gonna backtrack

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,810
and I'm gonna ask if you were at the

00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:55,620
jingo con in 2008 let you raise your

00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:57,150
hand oh my gosh not very many this is

00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,040
actually this is this is more exciting

00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:01,200
than I thought it would be okay if you

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,830
were at the Django con in 2009 can you

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,380
raise your hand

00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:06,300
and I know from Russ is talking from

00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,840
Adrian's introduction that there are two

00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:12,200
hands that are just going to get tired

00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:18,890
if you were at the jingo con in 2010 let

00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:21,320
us know okay 2011 we get a few more

00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:23,510
hands this time 2012 that was the DC

00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,560
year we had a couple hands drop some

00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:29,750
y'all didn't to go all the way out there

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,920
and now 2013 a few more oh okay I really

00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,089
love it you can put your hands on now

00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,370
I'm gonna do the others as we get to

00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:37,760
them so you get to rest you get to rest

00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:39,380
I do love that there are actually so few

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,910
hands raised because that means that

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,320
over the past five years we have

00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,029
introduced a lot of new people to our

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,160
community so that's another thing I'm

00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:48,560
really proud of for dinger climb one

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,260
thing about 2013 was really interesting

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,190
there was only one keynote it was a

00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:56,330
Russell Keith sneaky he gave the DFS but

00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,470
that can't possibly be right right

00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,510
that's one key note it is not nearly

00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:01,970
enough foraging or con us you know we

00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:03,560
had two plenary sessions that year so we

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,150
distinguished between the keynote and

00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,100
the plenary session I'm not really sure

00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:09,710
the difference and I was there so I'm

00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:12,770
not sure Jacob Kaplan Moss and a maraca

00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:14,810
gostin gave the plenary sessions that

00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,940
you were Benassi keynotes I do also want

00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,830
to mention that 2013 was the year that

00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,720
we welcome to django con Australia to

00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,890
the Ginga con family I know we have a

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,970
couple of the dinger clan Australia

00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:28,040
organisers with us here today I do want

00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:32,540
to switch tones for just a moment to a

00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:34,310
more serious tone in 2013 we lost a man

00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,910
named Malcolm tread Nick I never got to

00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,680
meet

00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:38,240
Malcolm but I've heard wonderful things

00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,240
about him and so I did want to take a

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,280
moment to acknowledge him he was part of

00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,500
the very early stages of Jenko he had a

00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,560
wonderful reputation as a friendly

00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,930
person as someone who was actively

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,850
encouraging to new people and so in 2013

00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,740
the Django Software Foundation

00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,100
established a memorial prize in his

00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,050
honor

00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,880
so Russell wrote in the blog post

00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,950
announcing this prize with Malcolm's

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,209
memory in mind the DSF is proud to

00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:04,430
announce that with the blessing of his

00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:06,589
family we will be establishing an award

00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:08,600
and Malcolm's name the prize will be

00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:11,209
awarded annually to someone who welcomes

00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,980
supports and nurtures newcomers freely

00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:15,459
gives feedback and assistance to others

00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:18,380
and helps to grow the community and

00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:19,760
again I said that I did not know Malcolm

00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,770
personally I never got the chance to

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,670
meet him but I do sincerely hope that he

00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:25,200
would be proud

00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:34,150
what we do here at Django con us today

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:36,620
[Applause]

00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:38,740
20:14 brought us back to Portland

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,450
we had a real love affair with Portland

00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:44,480
the keynote count was down to two Dan

00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:46,070
daniela prasada and brandon roads but

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,990
really it was three there was a talk

00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:50,480
that kind of spans both Andrew Godwin

00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:52,040
also gave a talk that that spanned both

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,260
of the sessions but wasn't tagged as a

00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,860
keynote there was some inconsistency

00:12:54,260 --> 00:13:01,430
there for several years in terms of

00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,960
photos that was the year of the duck I

00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:05,540
was putting these slides together

00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:08,180
earlier today and Jeff saw this photo

00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:10,370
and he said you know I I really love

00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:12,710
cactus I'm so happy that there are

00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:15,850
sponsors year after year thank God

00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,850
they've never brought that talk back

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,900
apparently it was very wide and and kept

00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:26,930
appearing in different places I wasn't

00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:29,660
there that year so I don't know 2015

00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:31,820
brought several changes first of all it

00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,820
brought Django Khan's down to Texas to

00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,320
Austin and that was the year that as we

00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,850
talked about this morning Django Caan

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,250
was taken over by the django events

00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,690
foundation North America so that was

00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,480
whatever dingo con transitioned from

00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:47,120
being run by a corporate entity to being

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,000
run by a non-profit consisting solely of

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,890
volunteers that was also the first year

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,540
that Django girls was part of Django con

00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:57,260
we held our first django girls workshop

00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:59,600
in 2015 in Austin Texas and that was the

00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:04,010
year that we raffled off the the very

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,660
large cut out of the the coffee guy who

00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:08,660
has a name someone if I made the same

said we've been coming here for years

00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,090
and this is the warmest django con i can

00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,830
remember that's something that just

00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:14,750
really warms an organizers heart to hear

00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:17,720

blog post in all these little ways they

00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,800
sent a clear and cohesive message that

00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,950
emphasized the importance of making

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,390
everyone feel welcome so that feels like

00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:32,710

00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:59,550
you were here in 2017 there we go I feel

00:15:54,839 --> 00:16:01,680
like I saw a couple of hands not up so I

00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:03,420
do want to take some more moments to it

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,449
to brag on Jango Khan a little bit but

00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:08,970
also to let you know some numbers about

00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:12,389
what what happens at Jango Khan this

00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:16,079
year we had 335 attendees so that's all

00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:17,550
y'all we gave away eighteen thousand

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:25,920
seven hundred and thirty five dollars in

00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:27,449
financial aid thank you very much to

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,170
sairaag or our financial a chair for

00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:30,170
managing that process

00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:43,950
we gave that aid to 25 financial aid

00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:45,870
recipients this next number is one that

00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:54,540
I'm particularly proud of we had a

00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:56,190
record 245 talk submission we had

00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,870
serious conversations about whether we

00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,610
could make a third track work this year

00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,260
and we couldn't make it work this year I

00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:04,020
I don't know what the future holds for

00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:05,429
us but that that number of submissions

00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,140
shows that people want to speak here

00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:09,270
people have wonderful things to say and

00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,920
you got to hear from our 52 presenters

00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:19,350
this week so I hope that you liked what

00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:20,790
they had to say and I should have put on

00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,170
this slide a little bit earlier because

00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:26,179
you're just gonna have to keep talking

00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:28,290
for a while so you know shake it out now

00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:29,640
I've talked a little bit about money

00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:31,559
about the financial aid that we've given

00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,240
away but I'm throwing a conference cost

00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:35,220
money throwing a conference that is

00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,780
affordable for people to attend cost

00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,910
money and that money comes from our

00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:41,040
sponsors we would not be able to do

00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:43,500
Gengo con the way that we do django con

00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:47,090
without the support from sponsors such

00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,090
as our diamond sponsor lincoln loop

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,400
our platinum sponsor

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,559
our gold sponsors Resnick

00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,429
and back

00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:16,090
and every and guidebook and next No

00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:25,200
our silver sponsors Tito Rover and

00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:25,200
boring software and aviation

00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:41,570
our imaginary landscape and our

00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,570
diversity sponsor is definitely DSS and

00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:53,310
you can take a little break now go check

00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,600
it out I also want to and I know that

00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:56,340
all the organizers do too we would not

00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,290
be able to have a conference if no one

00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:02,220
came there would you know this could

00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:03,960
just be one big slack channel so I do

00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,090
want to thank all of you who made the

00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,490
trip out here to come to Django con to

00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:10,920
attend talks to have conversations in

00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:14,250
the hallway to look for jobs to hang out

00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,840
in the hotel bar to attend tutorials we

00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,740
really appreciate your time than we hope

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,350

the attendees for being here back to

00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:31,620
that giant slack Channel analogy without

00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:33,390
our speakers and our tutorial presenters

00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,860
there would really you know not be very

00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,240
much reason for everyone to make the

00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,200
trip out here it would be really fun to

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,210
hang out with three hundred of your

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,010
closest friends for the weekend but your

00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:43,590
bosses probably wouldn't pay for it so

00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:45,810
thank you very much for our speakers for

00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:48,750

00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,950
and all of the the time that it takes to

00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,030

couple years is put all of our talks on

00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:10,760
YouTube afterwards and we obviously

00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,950
couldn't do that without the excellent

00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:20,350

00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:20,350

been trying to get very nice portraits

00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,950
of all of the the speakers which is a

00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:03,820
nice bonus for our speakers to have but

00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:05,740
he's also had a really really quiet and

00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:09,460
unobtrusive been going around making

00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:10,900
little clicking sounds also if you have

00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,280
volunteered this Jango Khan if you've

00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,630
worked the registration desk if you've

00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,220
been a session chair a session runner

00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:18,030
can you please stand up and let us give

00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,030
you a round of applause

00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,990
genuine wouldn't happen without people

00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:34,520
to to check everyone in without people

00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,230
to tell speakers where to go and to

00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,630
introduce speakers so that volunteer

00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,860
time really is appreciated and now this

00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,480
is the part where I get to embarrass all

00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:45,610
the organizers can you all join me on

00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,610
stage I know I know I know

00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:21,210
all right on three we'll all looking at

00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:21,210
him one two three

00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:49,620
hmm something's happening am I on okay

00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,770
so I tend to try to avoid public

00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:53,820
speaking so I almost did but he's got a

00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:56,400
lot of things need to be said

00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:59,160
so Phil Carleton wants there are two

00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,510
things with the seem excuse me there are

00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,980
only two hard things computer science

00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:04,560
cache invalidation and naming things

00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,460
well Phil was wrong there is a third and

00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,950
that's organizing the conference

00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,630
honestly honestly chairing the

00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,130
conference is even harder running a

00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:12,870
conference that requires naming lots of

00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,880
things for one and if you think cache

00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:16,110
invalidation is hard try running an

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,990
inclusive diverse and welcoming

00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:20,340
conference so lacy has left her mark on

00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:22,890
this conference by literally dotting

00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:26,340
every I and every T on all levels you

00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:27,660
know including her fierce red pin I can

00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,250
say this after terian for two years

00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:31,800
having the honor of co train was lacy

00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,880
for last year and then watching her

00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,490
chair this year she's done a wonderful

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,840
job so everybody here has received a

00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:39,030
special badge this year to mark the

00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,800
occasion of being at Spokane however

00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:43,080
that wasn't the only special badge we

00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,640
created so I'll be honest with you I

00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,230
don't quite understand the meaning of

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,210
this badge in order to understand the

00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:53,040
University of Texas love of the Olive

00:23:48,210 --> 00:24:00,150
Garden when you're there you're family

00:23:53,040 --> 00:24:03,300
so however we created a special Black

00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:04,770
Swan badge for lacy and actually we've

00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:07,070
made 25 of them because their minimum

00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,070
orders

00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:28,620
so Lacey on behalf of our community in

00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,880
our attendees we love you and we want to

00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,860
thank you from the bottom of our hearts

00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,330
for chairing this year so please give

00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:47,339
away see another round of applause

00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:47,339
