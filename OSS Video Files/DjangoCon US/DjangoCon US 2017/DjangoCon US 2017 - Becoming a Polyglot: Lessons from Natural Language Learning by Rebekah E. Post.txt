	DjangoCon US 2017 - Becoming a Polyglot: Lessons from Natural Language Learning by Rebekah E. Post

As a trained linguist and former university language instructor, people often assume that my natural language* (spoken, signed, or written) learning analysis background made learning to code easier for me. They might say something like “That makes sense, they’re languages, right? They have syntax.” These casual comments seem true on the surface when talking about parts of speech and variable types. But once you dig deeper, it becomes clear that there are far more differences than similarities between these types of languages despite the shared name. However, many skills and methods I have utilized in learning languages and teaching languages as an adult to adults have served me well as a developer.

This talk first addresses key points of divergence between learning a natural language and a programming language. Perhaps most importantly, natural languages are meant for communicating with people and programming languages are meant for giving a computer directions.

However, many areas of overlap exist in learning and perfecting these skills; these shared aspects of learning are the primary focus of this talk. (* And, yes, that’s the same ‘natural language’ as in ‘natural language processing.’)

00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:18,660
well thanks it's great to see MIT so

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,340
many of you here today as he mentioned

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,869
we're gonna talk about becoming a

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:26,669
polyglot lessons from natural language

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:29,910
learning and first hi why did this pop

00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:32,279
into my head well when I was 13 I

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,780
started learning French like a lot of

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,090
people do in high school not a big deal

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,270
I went to college kept learning French

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,710
decided I wanted to teach it got to

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,180
student teaching a lot of my students

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,190
were native Spanish speakers so I was

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,960
like I shouldn't graduate yet I should

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,219
learn Spanish that'd be a great idea and

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,250
then I could teach my students better

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:52,649
and then I did that and realized

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,839
actually high school is a little bit

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:58,559
rough I should become a college

00:00:54,839 --> 00:01:00,839
professor so I went on and was working

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:05,309
on my PhD and decided that that wasn't

00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:07,170
enough so I I had lived in Tunisia for a

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:09,840
year between undergrad and grad school

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,390
and I thought you know the way they

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,600
speak in Tunisia is super awesome I want

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,640
to do some studies about stuff like that

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,560
and so I learned well it's gonna take

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,910
learning Arabic and I figured yeah you

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,350
know PhD Arabic let's do all of it and

00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:27,540
once I finished all of that I realized

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,670
you know being a professor probably

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,360
isn't really the lifestyle that I'm

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:36,000
after and I had done some Python to

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,640
analyze my language data and became a

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,140
developer instead when I tell people

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,120
that they're like oh yeah that kind of

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:47,520
makes sense you know languages syntax

00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:50,610
and I'm like kinda and so let's talk

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,630
more about that and just in case you

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,840
think that it's the people that I've met

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:58,170
I got this quote from the code ketamine

00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,080
JavaScript course just like a language

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,540
has nouns verbs and prepositions

00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,890
JavaScript has its own building blocks

00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,990
instead of calling them building blocks

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,200
however because that's what nouns and

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:13,800
verbs are called whatever developers

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,110
call them datatypes I'm like well okay

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,420
all right there's some similarities

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,920
there are also some differences and

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,719
knowing what the similarities and

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,150
differences helps us to better

00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:26,380
appreciate where we can transfer those

00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:29,890
ways of learning and where we can so

00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,450
let's start with the differences oh but

00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,980
I'm gonna be saying natural language a

00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,060
lot throughout this and when you might

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,040
wonder well why don't you just say

00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,690
spoken language spoken language sure

00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,650
that's gonna be English French Spanish

00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:43,720
Arabic whatever else but we have such a

00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,910
wealth of languages in the world that

00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,350
our sign languages american sign

00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:49,060
language british sign language did you

00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:52,150
know that not all English shares the

00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,920
same sign language we don't and so by

00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:56,950
saying natural language we're being sure

00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:01,390
to include all natural languages and

00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:04,540
that's pretty awesome now on to the

00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:08,440
differences the first thing that we want

00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:11,850
to think about is who-who is this

00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,900
language trying to get information to

00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:17,230
with a natural language it's pretty

00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:19,590
obvious people human beings we are

00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:23,050
communicating ideas to people who are

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,640
ideally listening and in a conversation

00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,840
having some sort of exchange with us

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,790
thinking about the words that we're

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,590
saying all this kind of stuff with a

00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:36,010
programming language computer we are

00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:39,220
giving instructions to the computer to

00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:41,890
carry out the lesson here is that these

00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,990
are fundamentally different there's just

00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,780
there's no back and forth with the

00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:48,760
computer there's and you might say well

00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:52,330
what about errors we'll get there and

00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:57,600
it's just so different to begin with

00:03:52,330 --> 00:04:03,040
because of who these languages are for

00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:05,500
then why why is it so fundamentally

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,260
different that's partly about why we are

00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,450
using these types of languages with

00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,190
natural languages we are expressing our

00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,370
emotions we are asking for clarification

00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:18,100
we are giving more information we might

00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:21,010
be simply you saying things in a certain

00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:23,560
way to express part of our identity who

00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:27,130
we are that language is a lot of more

00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:30,430
about the ideas around what we're saying

00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:32,260
than the actual content of the words of

00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,580
what we're saying and we can express a

00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:38,260
lot of things through the way we say

00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:40,490
things when we come to a programming

00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,229
language we might be doing some

00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,180
amazing stuff and a lot of people in

00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:47,240
here are doing just incredible stuff

00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:49,039
hopefully everyone but no matter what

00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,770
we're doing with that programming

00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:55,669
language we are still writing code

00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:57,500
that's going to be turned into assembly

00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:59,660
language sent to us an assembler and

00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,720
turn into machine code we are giving

00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:04,910
directions to a computer we can be doing

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,569
all of these amazing different things

00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:10,610
but at the end of the day that's what

00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:12,139
programming is it's giving directions to

00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,180
a computer because we're the ones doing

00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:15,710
the amazing things the computer cannot

00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,819
do it on its own even the computer it

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:20,780
wouldn't exist without other amazing

00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:22,580
people the lesson here is then that

00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:26,180
these types of languages have very

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,889
different goals that communicating to

00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,470
way more than to a with other human

00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:32,509
beings is just extremely different from

00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:36,949
giving directions to a computer to have

00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:41,509
it do what we want to do then there's

00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:44,300
also how we learn things with natural

00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:46,039
languages if we're hearing before we're

00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,169
even born we start to hear the language

00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:50,120
that is spoken around us or languages

00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:51,770
right it's not uncommon it's actually

00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,240
more common in the world to hear more

00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:56,060
than one language those of us in the

00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,740
u.s. often forget that and so we start

00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,919
hearing these languages and even newborn

00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:04,009
babies react differently when they hear

00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:06,020
the languages language or languages that

00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:07,820
were spoken around them while they were

00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,590
in the womb than they do with a

00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,860
different language that they've never

00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:16,069
been exposed to and that's super awesome

00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:19,039
so from the very beginning or before the

00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:23,240
beginning how you look at it we are

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:26,569
allergic learning languages that deaf

00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,130
children are seeing signs or seeing

00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:30,650
gestures if their parents are hearing

00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:33,199
and they are learning it from the start

00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:35,509
later on we might add one two three four

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,669
more you can keep learning languages

00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:39,139
literally until you die it'll take you

00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:39,770
longer but you still can do it which is

00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:43,099
pretty awesome

00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:46,430
our brains do cool things but then

00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:48,710
there's programming languages you can

00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:53,000
start pretty young hour of code has a

00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:54,560
really fun pre reader section but

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,180
you still have to have a kid who's got a

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,920
certain level of logic and a certain

00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,870
level of facility with a computer so

00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,320
maybe four or five year old I'm guessing

00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:06,440
there I started with code Academy great

00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,240
website free stuff a friend of mine went

00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,890
to get a developers Academy which I'm

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,110
just using to show all of these boot

00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:14,450
camps and coding academies that exist

00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,800
out there no matter what though maybe

00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,990
you have a teacher or maybe you don't

00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,550
what you're doing is learning to sit

00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,710
down in front of a computer and learning

00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:24,230
how to give a computer the directions

00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:27,740
that it needs in order to do the things

00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:29,690
that you want it to do you can learn

00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,130
lots of programming languages you might

00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,750
have a special connection with your

00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,880
first programming language but the

00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,630
lesson here is that there are no native

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,650
speakers of programming languages and

00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:41,600
some of you may say well why is that

00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:44,419
matter well there's this common

00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,550
conception possibly misconception we can

00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:48,410
talk more about that at lunch that

00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:51,520
native speakers are the gold standard by

00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:54,350
which everything should be judged but

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,169
you can't judge yourself against

00:07:54,350 --> 00:08:01,460
something that doesn't exist so when

00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:03,830
we're coding everybody has learned this

00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:06,740
they may have learned it more easily or

00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,270
more slowly they may be amazing at it or

00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,550
they still may be working on it

00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:13,010
but everybody has learned this in a

00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:17,260
conscious way it's not that baby who

00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:17,260
just unconsciously learns that language

00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:24,770
our next comparison is variation and

00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:27,680
change all my favorite topics if we're

00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:29,000
working with a natural language then we

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,669
will see different ways of saying the

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,930
same thing there might be nuances

00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:36,409
between these different ways but the

00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:38,419
basic goal is the same so you might go

00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:41,330
to the store you should go to the store

00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:43,580
or in the South local here you might

00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,589
should go to the store and while you

00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:48,470
might you know giggle a little bit one

00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:51,490
of my co-workers uses my could I love it

00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:55,070
you'll still understand the basic intent

00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:57,080
there are also non-standard ways of

00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:01,490
speaking that are completely valid and

00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:03,500
that we can understand just fine so if

00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,839
you hear something like I ain't never

00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,660
done nothing like that before

00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:09,000
you may have judgment

00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:13,019
about it that's your problem but you

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
will understand it this is also this

00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:18,060
tolerance for variation is how we get

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,889
changed at some point someone said for

00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:23,279
the first time let me google that for

00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:25,680
you and whoever they were speaking to

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,500
may or may not have understood now we

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,449
definitely all understand it and the

00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,300
fact that this caught on is also

00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:40,560
meaningful because certainly nobody says

00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:41,850
let me yahoo that for you but with

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,069
programming languages we don't have it

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,319
quite so easy if we want something to

00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:48,269
work in Python and not just come back

00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:51,839
with an error we can't replace that

00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:53,910
equal sign with an is or with an EQ we

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,040
can't change the order to a way that a

00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,269
human being would naturally understand

00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,680
oh yeah she means the same thing there

00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:01,709
that's cool that'll work I can do that

00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:04,680
no the computers gonna throw back errors

00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:07,079
at you it's just not the way it is if we

00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,600
try to use a regex and we do research

00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:12,209
great everything is fine if we try to

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,459
just type in read on Google you're gonna

00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:16,649
get a syntax error and somebody's

00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:18,959
probably going oppa wait I could do that

00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:21,149
I could tell it to accept read out

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,519
Google yeah you could that's awesome you

00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:26,160
could give directions to the computer to

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,899
make it learn variation and that's the

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,819
point that you have to tell the computer

00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:32,850
that this variation is completely

00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:34,050
acceptable otherwise it just truly

00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,300
doesn't know what to do with it we've

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,939
all had you know a space in the wrong

00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:42,120
spot or an indentation error in Python

00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:44,610
or a period extra or missing depending

00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,230
and you have to go back and fix it

00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:51,720
because it has to be literally what it

00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:54,209
expects Computers don't do variation

00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,809
people do variation people add variation

00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:59,819
for the computers to understand then

00:10:57,809 --> 00:11:01,439
let's move on to the similarities so

00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:02,939
we've learned a lot from the differences

00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:05,399
what we can and can't expect out of

00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:07,860
these programming languages brains

00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,269
brains are wonderful they do so many

00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,430
amazing things that we don't think about

00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:13,379
that we just automatically do it's

00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:16,439
fantastic we pick up information about

00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:18,899
the world all around us and they help us

00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:20,190
remember things like natural languages

00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:25,200
and programming languages

00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:30,160
but they just don't go on forever right

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:32,350
you need to sleep to commit memories so

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,610
getting enough sleep when you're trying

00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:36,360
to learn a natural language or a

00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:39,010
programming language will help you

00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:43,300
stress a little bit of stress can help

00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:47,260
your brain a lot of stress not good so

00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:50,080
more sleep less stress can help us be

00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:52,300
better at natural languages or

00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,700
programming languages the lesson here is

00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,260
to respect your brain's limits there are

00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,910
other ways that it has limits you know

00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:02,380
people say self-care take a break yeah

00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:04,930
that's this to respect your brain the

00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,430
next thing is that okay you've got these

00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:08,770
physical things up but we're talking

00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:11,620
about languages right yeah we are

00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,970
languages are skills programming

00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,640
languages natural languages they're

00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:19,500
skills the example I like to use in

00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:23,230
Texas where I taught big football school

00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:25,650
tell a class of 25 students coming to

00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:29,890
learn French they're so excited

00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:32,370
imagine I give the quarterback brand new

00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:35,920
quarterback maybe played football as kid

00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:39,190
the playbook and a book about how to

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,480
throw a football when they're sitting

00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:45,700
there looking at me like what's wrong

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:47,350
with you and so then I say all right do

00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,020
we put that person on the field for the

00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:53,650
first game and then they are horrified

00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:55,420
right reading about a thing is not the

00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:57,730
same as doing a thing you can't throw a

00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:00,160
football just by reading about it like

00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,240
even a generally athletic person they

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,550
might be able throw it you know

00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,460
technically yes I threw it it landed

00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:08,530
there but you're not gonna go through it

00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:13,680
all the way down the field and that's

00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:17,140
the goal that we need to practice

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,240
natural languages or programming

00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:22,120
languages we absolutely have to practice

00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:25,300
the minute we quit practicing it's so

00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,910
sad but our skills start declining and

00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,950
you might say oh you can pick it back up

00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:31,300
yeah those neural pathways are there

00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,279
they just have to be strengthened all

00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,449
the time so yeah

00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,699
can pick it back up later it will be

00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:40,290
easier to relearn than to learn the

00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:42,870
first time but it's it's just the way

00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:44,129
skills work right somebody quits playing

00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,449
football and they still know the rules

00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:48,529
they still can throw the ball but they

00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:50,839
can't throw it quite as far as before

00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:53,790
then while we're talking about skills

00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:56,189
when we're teaching natural languages we

00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:58,439
often talk about the four skills we've

00:13:56,189 --> 00:14:02,129
got speaking listening writing and

00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:04,769
reading cool great students are often

00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:07,470
better at one or two or maybe even three

00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:10,470
of the four than another one but there

00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:12,180
is that imbalance that if someone's

00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,860
learning French there is a huge amount

00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,499
of French and English vocabulary that's

00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,089
shared if you're a fluent English

00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:20,189
speaker or if you're a Spanish speaker

00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:22,139
there's loads of vocabulary and grammar

00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:25,470
that's shared so maybe you're gonna have

00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:26,639
an easier time reading but when it comes

00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,350
to writing it still might be a little

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:32,100
bit harder and then if you're trying to

00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:33,899
listen to real speech on the radio

00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,540
whoo that's gonna be take some practice

00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:38,399
for Arabic at least the way it's tied at

00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,709
UT that actually kind of flips the

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:44,129
alphabet so different that it's easier

00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:45,750
to speak and listen to it for students

00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:48,029
at first than it is to be able to read

00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:50,550
and write it even now I have to kind of

00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:52,980
force myself to stop on those Arabic

00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:57,540
Facebook posts and keep practicing

00:14:52,980 --> 00:15:00,059
reading Arabic then for our programming

00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:04,350
languages we don't really think about it

00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:05,939
but it's kind of the same we write code

00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,889
of course that's what we learn to do

00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:10,740
that's how it's taught most of the time

00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:14,660
here write code it's amazing you can

00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:17,819
make your computer do things yeah so

00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:20,279
most of us that I know we write some

00:15:17,819 --> 00:15:22,709
code but we spend a lot of time reading

00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:24,420
other people's codes because some bug

00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:26,069
came up somewhere because we have to

00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,679
integrate with some vendor product

00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:30,929
because we can't figure out what's going

00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:33,269
on with this existing system and we just

00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:36,300
need to add on to it so we end up

00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:39,179
reading code which is a different aspect

00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,949
of that skill set maybe there's a bug

00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:42,660
that we can't fix when we go to stack

00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:45,310
overflow being able to sift through

00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:51,810
what's just rudeness and what's

00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:53,950
full is a skill then talking about code

00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:56,320
talking to our co-workers about code

00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:58,420
talking to our clients about code and

00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,800
what it's going to do these are skills

00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,779
that need practice that you can get

00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,210
better at so when you feel like you're

00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:05,470
doing terrible at something or that

00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:07,240
somebody else is so much more awesome

00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:11,170
with something stop and think about

00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:13,510
their full skill set because we all have

00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:15,160
strengths and weaknesses and of course

00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,890
try not to compare yourselves but you

00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,740
know that's not a topic the lesson here

00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:23,200
then is that there are many many facets

00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,940
of skills to work on and that we all can

00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:33,700
be working on these in one area or

00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:38,529
another would I think that's probably

00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:40,450
some blue sky and a tree and doesn't

00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:43,830
that just happen when you are listening

00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:46,990
to a new language reading a new language

00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:50,920
trying to fix a bug in a language you're

00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:53,320
less familiar with what the heck do you

00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:56,110
do I have no idea what's going on here I

00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,780
know this language like I can pick out

00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:02,410
some of these words just like their

00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:05,740
colors but what is going on we have to

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:08,290
ask questions there are other people who

00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,910
know more than us or who know different

00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:12,970
things than us or who can help us think

00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:15,100
in different ways asking questions is so

00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:17,949
important to learning and to becoming an

00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,939
expert you say asking questions is hard

00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:19,720
and then they will know that I don't

00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:22,270
know everything

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,550
weird jerk if they think that you have

00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,810
to know everything because each of us

00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,040
sometimes were the person on the left

00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:30,130
sometimes were the person on the right

00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:32,470
we all know more in one area than

00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:35,380
another we all know less in one area

00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:37,960
than another if you're super amazing at

00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,850
coding in all of the languages that you

00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,590
know right now that is awesome

00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,330
good for you hopefully you can remember

00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:45,850
what it was like to be the person who

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:48,150
knew less if you can't then pay more

00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:50,770
attention to the people who do know less

00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,480
see how they act see how they interact

00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:54,940
with other people and see where you can

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,770
help them sometimes the people who know

00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,050
less will ask questions that will help

00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,940
the people who know

00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,440
or improve their code me like why don't

00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,960
do it this way instead of this other way

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,180
that I just read about and like yeah why

00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:09,540
did I do it that way you know it can be

00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:11,190
a good experience so we might not all be

00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,740
experts and everything we're definitely

00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:16,190
not we're but we're also not all just

00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:19,740
completely clueless on everything either

00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:22,590
the lesson here is that we need feedback

00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:26,460
and review code reviews can be

00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:28,400
intimidating but without that you don't

00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,780
know if you've got some major flaws that

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,700
are just gonna come bite you in the ass

00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:36,300
like five minutes after it goes into

00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:38,220
prod with learning natural languages - I

00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,840
might think that yeah I heard this word

00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,760
I read in the dictionary it means this

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,640
no problem great I go out in the world

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:47,160
and I use this word and I get a really

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,590
bad reaction I'm like but this means

00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,540
this right they're like yeah it means

00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:53,820
that but you only say it if you're

00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,950
trying to make somebody go away or you

00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:58,890
only say it depending on the culture if

00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:03,210
you're a man or a woman and you just you

00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:05,370
cannot say that word that happens so we

00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:07,680
have to interact with other people we

00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:10,830
have to make ourselves vulnerable to

00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:16,400
being told we're wrong in order to

00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:18,780
improve and get better all right

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,150
everybody's like oh what's this

00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:23,190
what's that seven doing there that seven

00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:26,370
happens to represent a glottal stop

00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:29,670
which is not a meaningful consonant in

00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:33,060
any language that I can think okay no

00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:37,470
Mel T's in most languages that use the

00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:40,160
Roman alphabet but in American English

00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:45,930
you'll notice it in things like uh-oh

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:47,550
it's not oh-ho oh that little break

00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:50,250
right there that's the glottal stop so

00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:52,980
in Squamish this first nation's language

00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:55,020
in on the coast of Canada on the west

00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,290
coast I mean you know I'm from Tacoma

00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:00,270
it's not the only one that counts they

00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:02,370
have a glottal stop and they write their

00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:05,040
language primarily and the Roman

00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:07,950
alphabet like okay cool that's

00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:11,410
definitely about natural languages where

00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:13,660
are you going so these are if statement

00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:17,440
in the four languages that I work with

00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:22,120
on a regular basis on the top left

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:24,280
we've got Python if with a colon at the

00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,410
end bottom left we got Django we've got

00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,860
our nice little curly brackets and

00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:32,050
percent signs if and then we've got to

00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:36,070
add that indus squished together

00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:39,910
one word lower case top right is SPSS

00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:44,350
syntax and in my particular shop we use

00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:46,900
this for data prep and it has to be do

00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:49,240
if the Capitals are convention but not

00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:51,190
required and you need a period at the

00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:55,900
end of all of these statements and you

00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:57,760
have end space if period then we have

00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,610
the programming language called natural

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:05,110
as done by software AG that we use at UT

00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:08,700
with our super awesome mainframe so the

00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:14,740
Capitals are required in this one if

00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:16,750
then also required and - if so if I've

00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,630
been doing a lot of natural I might go

00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:21,730
into SPSS and accidentally do an in - if

00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:24,010
period then I'm gonna get an error like

00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:26,910
oh dang it did that again or if I go

00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:29,680
into Django I might be like in space if

00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:31,360
nope still not working this is

00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,580
completely normal

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,970
this happens all the time bilingualism

00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:40,360
or poly legalism multilingualism has

00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:42,340
lots of benefits it helps us to think

00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,720
faster see things in different ways but

00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,240
are there also some things that we end

00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,600
up doing like mixing up which is which

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,520
every now and then in natural languages

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,560
it can actually help to delay the onset

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,500
of Alzheimer's and dementia which is

00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:58,240
super cool nobody wants that stuff but

00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,470
it's also good for programming languages

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,180
because you can learn to think about

00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:03,100
things in different ways and learn which

00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:07,420
of your tools might be the right one in

00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:11,170
each situation so our lovely sign with

00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:14,050
our lesson that a bilingual is not to

00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:15,430
monolinguals in one that we see things

00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:18,100
differently we work with things

00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:20,890
differently and that is just such a

00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:23,470
great thing it brings richness into how

00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:26,049
we approach problems and what we do

00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:27,759
and so it can help us as we are trying

00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:30,029
to fix problems and it can help the

00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:35,259
organizations that we work for

00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:41,049
finally bottom line those beautiful nice

00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:43,899
green dollar bills what you may know in

00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:45,909
a lot of areas that if you speak Spanish

00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:46,539
a lot of the areas of us if you speak

00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:48,610
Spanish

00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:50,230
you might get paid more for being

00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:54,879
bilingual school teachers for example

00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:56,919
you can get a bilingual bonus I learned

00:22:54,879 --> 00:22:59,559
at a conference two weeks ago but this

00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:02,139
is true of programming as well that on

00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:05,590
average learning adding a new language

00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:07,899
to your resume is about three thousand

00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:11,320
dollars more in salary per language I

00:23:07,899 --> 00:23:13,980
think we'd all like that so let's learn

00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,980
more money whoa

00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:19,600
no my last thing is languages are

00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:21,730
awesome whether they're natural

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,350
languages or programming languages

00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:25,299
natural languages learning more of them

00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:27,759
can help us communicate with more of the

00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:29,259
world in their native language and if

00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,750
you don't understand the value of that

00:23:29,259 --> 00:23:33,909
then please go learn a natural language

00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,950
go talk to a native speaker of that

00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:38,200
language in their language and then in

00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:40,210
your native language and see how it

00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:43,000
feels different see how that

00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:45,309
communication changes because it will

00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,250
and if you think it doesn't then try

00:23:45,309 --> 00:23:49,539
again but with programming languages too

00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:52,330
we really do think about it differently

00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:54,490
that with all the tools I have I will

00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:57,090
know okay so for this I'm going to use

00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:59,830
Python for this I'm gonna use SPSS

00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:01,720
because my shop uses it but I'm actually

00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,789
trying to get them to try to do it more

00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,200
in Python because I think that pandas

00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:08,379
will actually end up being a better

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:11,919
solution than the SPSS syntax and that's

00:24:08,379 --> 00:24:13,419
current pet project or you know maybe I

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,100
need to learn something else because I'm

00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:16,480
not quite sure if my tool set is the

00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,169
best right now and I want to make it

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,240
even better

00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:21,820
and all of these things will give us the

00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,159
right tools for the right job and help

00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:27,070
us to be better developers in the end

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:36,280
and that's awesome thank you

00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:36,280
