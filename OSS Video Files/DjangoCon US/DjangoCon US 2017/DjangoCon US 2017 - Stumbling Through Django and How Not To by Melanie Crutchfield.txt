	DjangoCon US 2017 - Stumbling Through Django and How Not To by Melanie Crutchfield

If you’re a beginner about to embark on a new Django project adventure, this talk is for you.

When I started my first Django project, I took the “Sure, I think I can figure that out” approach, which is fun! And also dangerous. But exciting! And also horrible because I caused myself a lot of trouble and barfed on my keyboard. (Metaphorically.) Oops.

My hope for this talk is to pass along lessons I learned the hard way, and save the world. Or at least prevent some frustration. :) We’ll talk about version control, structuring your project, and how to handle top secret stuff. We’ll also talk about throwing house parties without causing anaphylaxis, pregnant daddy seahorses, velociraptors, and friends. I promise all of that is related to Django.

[Music]

00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:22,460
hi you all look so nervous you can calm

00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:26,990
down everything's gonna be fine

00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:28,400
I don't know why you're so worried my

00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:33,470
name is Melanie

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,640
I'm a new ish Django developer you know

00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,090
that saying that somebody knows just

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,610
enough trouble enough to cause trouble

00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:43,040
like that's who I am so you may be

00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,350
asking yourself why am i listening to

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,860
this person who is not super fancy pants

00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:50,960
I don't know how you make your choices

00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:55,130
friend it's quite possible that you're

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,800
lost and looking for a donut but if

00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:00,260
you're here for Django or for donuts I

00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:06,590
know what I want you to get out of this

00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:10,070
talk okay here it is not too long ago I

00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:12,830
was diving face and brains first into my

00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:18,290
very first Django project there was a

00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:20,119
lot of chaos and confusion and carrots

00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:23,990
there weren't any carrots but I really

00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:27,080
liked alliteration but it was just kind

00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:30,670
of swirls of expletives and face palms

00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:34,340
and general madness I made some big

00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:39,080
costly mistakes and it turns out that

00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:41,659
those are decently avoidable so that's

00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,119
what I aim to give you I want to lay out

00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:46,790
to the beat by beat post-mortem of all

00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:49,220
of my flailing missteps so that you may

00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:52,939
avoid crying on your keyboards and

00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:56,119
vomiting on your rubber ducks not that I

00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:59,710
did that but that you might I don't know

00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:02,150
you here we go

00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:08,030
throwing house parties without causing

00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:10,090
anaphylaxis with Django so it's totally

00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:13,400
normal don't laugh

00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:15,769
the recommendation to me was to create

00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,570
virtual environments which I dismissed

00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:21,100
immediately because if I believe in

00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:24,780
anything I believe in laziness

00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:27,100
and climate change because science and

00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:30,270
that the toilet paper goes over not

00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:34,420
under cuz I'm like a decent person right

00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:36,400
yeah I also didn't totally understand

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,020
what a virtual environment was or what

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,670
it was going to do for me and I

00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,230
certainly wasn't going to unlace II

00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,420
myself for no good reason

00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:46,270
so let's take a look at that really

00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:48,700
quick quick note this is a rather long

00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:50,980
analogy so just pretend that you all

00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,830
love long analogies especially the ones

00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,960
with bad drawings thank you very much

00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:59,380
here we go okay so let's say that you

00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:01,780
have built a big and beautiful house and

00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,060
you've made it with a massive living

00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,980
room the living room is actually I can

00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,750
tell you loved this drawing I can feel

00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,990
it from your heart that's awesome okay

00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:13,360
um the living room is so big that you

00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,070
haven't bothered to make other rooms

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,830
you're just like I have a suite living

00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,960
room whatever so now you have some

00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,460
friends that want you to host a party at

00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,000
your house and you're like have you seen

00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,340
my living room

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,490
it's amazing of course I can do that and

00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,890
so you tell them okay your friends tell

00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:33,040
you what they need for the party they

00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:36,760
need classical piano music they need ham

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,490
sandwiches obviously and very critically

00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,710
they need there to be no peanuts because

00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:44,290
every last one of them is terribly

00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:46,660
allergic you can do this everything's

00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,430
fine so here comes the second group of

00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,560
friends and they also want to have a

00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,420
party in your massive living room and

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,250
you're like I can totally do that and

00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:57,250
they're like we need classical strings

00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:00,610
music okay that's fine they need turkey

00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,900
legs also fine and they need bottle

00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:05,410
rockets because they're weirdos

00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:07,900
apparently whatever you still say sure

00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,180
everything works fine another group

00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,220
comes you know what oh wait we're not

00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,870
there yet we're saying that it's fine

00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,250
everything went well we're just gonna

00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:19,540
skip over how well it went it was

00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:22,330
awesome everyone wept with joy the next

00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:24,070
group comes they're like we totally want

00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:26,110
a party and you're like obviously I'm

00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,700
amazing at it there's already to hear

00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:30,010
and everyone's having a good time and

00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,419
they've had this party in other places

00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,280
before and they bring all their own

00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:34,349
stuff and you're like sweet you just let

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,849
them do their thing right

00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:38,740
however it turns out that while you

00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:40,539
weren't looking they took a whole host

00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:45,669
of peanuts and threw them everywhere and

00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:47,770
now your first group is dead so bad get

00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:54,610
how sad they are you have XS for eyes

00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:58,180
y'all how this relates to Django thank

00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:01,090
you for bearing through that the first

00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:03,129
group is your first project right it's

00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:05,379
hanging out having a good time you put

00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:07,330
it in a second project also fine like

00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:09,580
it's a little bit different right but

00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:14,650
not so different that they can't get

00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:16,810
along the third project though maybe it

00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:19,259
has a different version of Python and a

00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:22,090
different version of Django and once you

00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:26,590
install the requirements file your first

00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:28,270
project just blows up summer and this

00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,419
brings us back to virtual environments

00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:33,759
the logical solution for throwing

00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:36,340
parties without becoming a mass murderer

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,979
murderer via peanuts is to build rooms

00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,199
right you build the rooms you stick each

00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:43,449
party in a different room and no one

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,409
kills each other hey that's like optimal

00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:48,520
for throwing parties just in case

00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:51,099
virtual environments do the same thing

00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:55,120
for development you can look this up in

00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:57,669
the documentation but here's the quick

00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,250
basics on it in Python 2 there is a

00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:02,770
package called virtual 11 that we

00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:05,560
install with tip install virtual ends

00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:08,229
and then whenever we want to build a

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:11,099
room build an environment we say virtual

00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:13,690
and and the name of the environment

00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:16,449
obviously in this case peanut-free

00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:18,580
because of the murdering in Python 3

00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:20,349
this is built-in so we don't have to

00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,719
install anything extra we just type

00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:25,509
Python 3

00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:27,969
- MV ENB full of peanuts and it will

00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:29,710
make that virtual environment for us you

00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:31,240
need to activate the environment

00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,800
otherwise it's just like going back to

00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,210
the living room and it'll just grab

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,469
whatever you have installed on your

00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:40,750
system and so to do that we'll type

00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:42,759
source the name of your project slash

00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,649
bin slash activate and when we press

00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:47,380
Enter it shows us that we've activated

00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:49,180
the environment by putting the name

00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:52,990
the environment in parentheses at the

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:55,720
beginning of the prompt now there's one

00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,940
more tool that although it involves

00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,160
installing a different thing which

00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:03,310
interferes with my laziness it actually

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,370
enables additional laziness later so

00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:08,890
I've started using it exactly so it's

00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:11,350
called virtual and / wrapper and we

00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:14,620
install it with pip install virtual and

00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:18,760
wrapper just like we did before then oh

00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:22,240
my gosh we have to take a second step by

00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,590
adding something to our bash profile you

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,210
can look this up also in the

00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,520
documentation for virtual and wrapper

00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:32,320
later but this is what it looks like oh

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:35,290
my gosh it's so much it's two lines but

00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:38,650
all of this allows us to do this later

00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:40,390
we just type MK / - m in the name of the

00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:44,020
environment to make a virtual

00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:46,300
environment and it automatically when

00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,040
you make it activates it for you as well

00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,220
so you don't have to do the whole like

00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:55,030
source love whatever that stuff was that

00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:58,120
I said later when we want to work on it

00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:01,350
we just type work on and the name of the

00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,880
environment and it activates it for us

00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:07,860
did you forget the name of your

00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:11,980
environment of course you did

00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:14,320
you're a human person just type work on

00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:16,510
press enter and it tells you all of your

00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,610
environment oh my gosh they're all there

00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:22,270
don't you love it yes

00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:25,690
alright next saying no to sea monsters

00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:30,430
and yes - pregnant daddy seahorses with

00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:32,979
Django ah when I started my first Django

00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:35,500
project what I understood myself to be

00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:37,360
doing was building a web app right it's

00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,820
an app there's one you're building here

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,190
we go got it so when you're looking at

00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:45,550
the commands that we use to create a

00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:49,150
Jenga web app we use start project and

00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:52,870
then we use start app which is obviously

00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:55,920
still kind of your web I think pretty

00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:58,480
much so in my mind we started a project

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,059
we started one app because we're only

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,349
making one app right something like this

00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:03,719
and then we would just shove everything

00:09:02,349 --> 00:09:06,369
into that app and it would be awesome

00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:09,699
why would you make more than one app

00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:12,279
well there are lots of things that we

00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:15,549
typically need to do with a project in

00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:17,019
five up my tiny baby project I have to

00:09:15,549 --> 00:09:21,039
store a collection of images that I

00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:24,219
curate I have to store messages that

00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:26,559
users enter and I have to schedule and

00:09:24,219 --> 00:09:29,379
send messages providing this

00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:33,459
functionality requires a bunch of models

00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:36,819
and views and other fun stuff if I try

00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:39,699
to start one and only one app this

00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:41,919
starts to look a little monstrous you

00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:43,569
have one file for your models you have

00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,369
one file for your views and everything

00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:48,699
just gets like bigger and bigger and

00:09:45,369 --> 00:09:50,859
well so now when you go back to find

00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:53,199
code for a specific thing that you want

00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:56,589
to adjust it's just kind of like a

00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:59,949
miserable task that looks like that and

00:09:56,589 --> 00:10:01,809
makes you dream up scary things so we

00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:03,999
use apps to avoid this but what you

00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:05,799
don't want to just be like this is messy

00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:08,529
and long so I'm gonna make a new app and

00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:10,389
then just it's like whatever what you

00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:12,249
want to do is think about each thing

00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:15,279
that your project needs to do and make a

00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:17,319
separate app for that so with five up I

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,669
started out with everything all jumbled

00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:24,129
into one app called five up creatively

00:10:20,669 --> 00:10:27,069
but I eventually transitioned to have an

00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:29,499
app for curated messages an app for

00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:32,439
custom user messages and an app for

00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:34,929
sending messages as well as this

00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:38,019
authentication thing that I made it's a

00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:42,119
little like and I accidentally named it

00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:42,119
fu off

00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:51,100
four five up right dang it

00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:53,380
so what we've done is instead of taking

00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:56,590
our baby seahorses and gluing them on

00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,780
the dad's like head neck and back and

00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,530
feet

00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,530
seahorses don't have feet they have

00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:04,390
tails gluing it on their tails we've

00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:06,640
left them as their own little adorable

00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:11,110
things and put them in the protection of

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:16,440
the daddy seahorse oh so cute they're so

00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:18,880
happy in there okay so I had on this I

00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,680
decided on this analogy before I had

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,880
googled what a daddy seahorse looks like

00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:28,590
and oh my god it is terrifying like it's

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,590
the stuff of nightmares don't do that

00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:38,170
protecting your velociraptors with

00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:39,880
Django so in my voyage through my first

00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,500
Django project I came across this blog

00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,090
post sorry friend that wrote the blog

00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,370
post I don't know what your name is so

00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:49,480
you don't get credit haha just kidding

00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:52,690
whatever anyway the blog post told me to

00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,800
save all of my static files locally so

00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,680
this means that when I was using

00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:59,290
bootstrap in addition to linking to the

00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,750
CDN I would download all of the CSS

00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:04,540
files and all the JavaScript and saved

00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:07,240
them in my static folder recalling that

00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,890
I am excessively lazy this did not sound

00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,540
like something I wanted to do surely

00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,560
that was at least two more steps no

00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,280
thank you

00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:17,620
and why why would you do this allow me

00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,050
to illustrate my disaster let's say that

00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,440
I found this really amazing jQuery thing

00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:28,950
that does something awesome something

00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:31,690
possibly like this haha that's amazing

00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,310
and we also know that there's like a ton

00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:35,410
of really useful reasons to put a

00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:38,140
velociraptor on your website don't even

00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:40,000
pretend like there is it anyway my thing

00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,589
was like a modal which is way boring and

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,300
does they have any dinosaurs in it but

00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:44,320
anyway so we'll just pretend that I did

00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,270
the dinosaur thing cause it's better

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,220
anyway

00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:49,780
so I do this amazing thing right I go to

00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:53,140
a coffee shop to continue working on my

00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:54,910
amazing things and I don't know the

00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,500
Wi-Fi password and like

00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:59,950
the barista looks really busy and I

00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:01,900
didn't want to bother them so I thought

00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:03,430
to myself hey I'm working in a local

00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:07,320
environment I totally don't need the

00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:07,320
internet internet doesn't own me

00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:13,120
internet totally owns you anyway

00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:15,070
I started up my local server and I go to

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,960
the whole like one to seven blah blah

00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:18,880
blah whatever it is only to discover

00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,970
that my velociraptor is gone and

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,420
everything looks like 1992 which was not

00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:27,280
an amazing year surely I have done

00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:30,130
something horrible right because I'm a

00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:32,050
beginner and I've done numerous horrible

00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,700
things at this point so I just start

00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:35,380
ripping apart my code that's logical

00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,270
right I just am like digging through

00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,010
everything and changing random things

00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:41,290
and like I don't know I just read

00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:44,050
something up let's ruin everything there

00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:46,090
was a lot of ripping apart so eventually

00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:49,390
I decide that I need to Google this

00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:51,160
right because that's what you do so I go

00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:54,010
and like beg the barista for the Wi-Fi

00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:56,020
password and I got like I look up like

00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:59,320
one thing and then go and refresh my

00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:03,730
server and my beautiful Velociraptor

00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:05,770
greets me again tears of joy and that's

00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,690
when it clicks that the only thing that

00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:09,010
was happening was that because of my

00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,900
lack of Internet

00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:12,580
I couldn't access like my CSS files

00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:17,320
JavaScript files anything that mattered

00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:19,510
files and that's what happened all of my

00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:23,020
independence from the internet was a lie

00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:25,150
if I had saved those files locally I

00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,820
wouldn't have had that problem right so

00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:30,000
there you go

00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:32,620
which brings me neatly to my next topic

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,770
terrified abandonment have drug full

00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:39,670
mistakes in Django all of this was

00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:43,350
happening on the one and only copy of my

00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,350
code my master branch

00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:53,880
I said remember that lady she was like

00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:58,110
I'm gonna restore the 19th century

00:14:53,880 --> 00:15:00,660
fresco Jesus it's not that my project is

00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:02,310
like an amazing piece of art but like

00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:09,240
maybe we both should have made a copy

00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:12,600
first and we recall how much ripping

00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:16,110
apart I did it was quite a bit and while

00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:19,950
my renewed internet access solved my

00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:24,090
Velociraptor problems that's the last

00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:26,100
time I promise okay anyway it didn't

00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:28,710
solve all the new problems that I had

00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,780
created because I had gone so far down

00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:34,080
the rabbit hole of fixing non-existent

00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:38,490
problems I had no idea how to get back

00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:40,170
to where I started this is not great I

00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:43,110
honestly don't know how I got back to

00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:44,580
where I was I just kind of like mom and

00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,860
eventually it worked out because that's

00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,000
basically what coding looks like right I

00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,920
mean I don't know like I said I'm not

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,210
experienced I assumed everyone does this

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,920
whoa

00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:57,840
anyway you don't have to tell me about

00:15:52,920 --> 00:16:00,780
that since that time I've discovered

00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:04,140
what I can essentially use as gits

00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:06,390
version of a panic button it's get

00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:09,390
branching is amazing

00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:13,020
so instead of using my anxious confusion

00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:17,850
to destroy all of my work I could have

00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:21,060
done this get checkout be to create a

00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:23,430
new branch appropriately called oh my

00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,680
god what have I done and then I could

00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:28,350
commit these changes to this new trash

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,500
branch with an appropriate get commit

00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:33,270
message made a giant mess of things and

00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,010
then I could check out the master branch

00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:36,180
and pretend that none of it ever

00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:38,220
happened

00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,760
which is what I do with all of my

00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:44,430
mistakes hooray so at this point I've

00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:47,760
gotten in the habit most of the time of

00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:49,410
just creating the branch first before I

00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,560
get myself into trouble so now my

00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:55,260
workflow looks like this say I want to

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,760
remove the Velociraptor because I

00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,090
promised you all I wouldn't do it

00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,520
anymore

00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:02,890
sadface I don't know why you don't like

00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,470
velociraptors anyway so I would make my

00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:09,400
changes and once I've confirmed that the

00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:11,790
changes are good then I would commit it

00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:15,130
and then check out the master branch and

00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:16,510
merge the changes you may need a

00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:20,020
different workflow based on the team

00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:22,960
that you're working with or other things

00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:25,510
I don't know but the point is if you're

00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:28,840
going to make changes make a new branch

00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:31,920
first unless you love drama then do what

00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:36,820
you want like I'm not the boss of you

00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:39,520
okay last two being suave and mysterious

00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:41,020
with Django surely I couldn't have

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,340
destroyed more than this right I mean

00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:46,900
this is quite a bit at this point it's

00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:49,180
getting ridiculous so wrong friends very

00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:51,340
wrong and this one actually feels like

00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,540
really tricky like I've been tricked or

00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,910
something like I know that's not the

00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:57,970
case but like it's super feels like that

00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:59,170
and it was actually exacerbated a little

00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:02,050
bit by the fact that I'm using it

00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:05,860
responsibly somewhat so what could it be

00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:07,750
let's find out it's a mystery okay so

00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:09,640
this is my settings file right this is

00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,440
the settings file that happens when you

00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,420
start a project in Django and notice

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,190
this lovely warning security warning

00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:18,010
keep the secret he used in production

00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:21,340
secret it doesn't explicitly tell us how

00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:23,620
to do that though so when the time came

00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,660
to deploy I thought well that's a cute

00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:28,120
idea that I don't know how to do tada

00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:30,780
let's just push it up and so that's what

00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,780
I did yeah I know

00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:40,660
as it turns out this project also needed

00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:44,770
my email address and my email password

00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:45,280
and for good yeah I know for good

00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,890
measure

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,540
I went ahead and put in some API keys

00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:57,730
and like a portion of my seventh-grade

00:18:49,540 --> 00:19:00,790
diary and why not uh yeah so please do

00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:02,260
not shame me publicly right I mean I

00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,370
think that's actually what I'm doing

00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,870
right now because this is gonna go on

00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,730
the internet but anyway I guess just

00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:09,970
enjoy my shame and hopefully it will

00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:12,520
save you some trouble in the future you

00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:14,320
don't ever do this right so I'm going to

00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,900
if this is something that you are going

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,670
to do I will tell you how not to it's

00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,930
just one way to do it there's lots of

00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:24,340
different ways so but this is what I do

00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:27,280
remember when we were talking about

00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:29,560
virtual environments aside from keeping

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,560
people from dying of peanut allergies

00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:36,280
metaphorically they can also hold our

00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,330
deepest darkest secrets that way our

00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,070
secrets aren't going to get into

00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:42,490
production and they're not going to get

00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:45,040
into your history like mine did so we're

00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:47,170
going to go to our activate script for

00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,540
me since I'm using virtual in improper

00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:54,100
all of my virtual environments are in an

00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:56,980
MS folder and so we'll go to M's extra

00:19:54,100 --> 00:20:00,130
peanuts then activate and we'll open up

00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:03,130
that activate script and add this bit to

00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:05,650
the end this is going to set a variable

00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:10,780
and export it with your actual secret

00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:13,300
key okay now in our settings file we'll

00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:15,160
add this function I believe this is

00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,690
what's recommended in two scoops of

00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,280
Django so if you don't have a

00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:23,830
photographic memory you can look it up

00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:26,350
there then in our settings file instead

00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:30,330
of having the actual secret key we'll

00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:34,510
put this function and what it will do is

00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:36,370
that it finds our environment variable

00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:39,340
that we set and activate script and

00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:41,860
you're all set so it's all super fancy

00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:44,020
and mysterious when you deploy you'll

00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,040
set whatever by environment variable you

00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:48,370
set

00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,230
in your activate script there as well in

00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:52,059
Heroku they're called config variables

00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:54,610
but they could have different names

00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:57,340
depending on where you deploy find that

00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:58,809
place set your variable and you're all

00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,059
set that way if you're working locally

00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:03,580
or if you're deployed it will find the

00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:09,100
variables that it needs and it'll be

00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:12,640
done making friends with Django okay

00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:15,910
last thing none of this would have been

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:18,160
even remotely possible without the San

00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:20,169
Diego Python user group San Diego PI

00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:24,970
ladies and of course our Blessed Mother

00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:27,610
the internet but the most important by

00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:31,240
far of the three is San Diego Python

00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:33,850
user group and PI ladies this is where

00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:37,270
I've gone nearly every Saturday for the

00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:41,110
past three years for encouragement for

00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:43,000
help for camaraderie our Saturday study

00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:45,640
groups are what made me believe I could

00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,290
do any of this to begin with

00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,350
and I've found a place where it's okay

00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:52,980
to be at whatever level of your learning

00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:56,500
that you're at our study group is

00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:58,900
absolutely why I'm here I can't stress

00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,299
how wonderful and important our

00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,950
community is and I want to show you

00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:06,549
something really quick that I worked on

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:09,100
for literally hours like six hours I

00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:11,440
couldn't figure out why I could submit a

00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:14,919
form but it wouldn't actually save a

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,770
record to my database and I've worked on

00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:22,450
it like crazy and then 60 seconds at our

00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:24,910
study group brought me this it's one

00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:27,450
character for every hour I spent that

00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:29,980
makes me feel good about myself

00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:31,990
special thanks to mica for helping me on

00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:35,350
that one even though you laughed at me a

00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:37,030
lot during the process and the amazing

00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:39,970
thing is that a couple years later I was

00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:43,120
able to do a similar teeny-weeny fix for

00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:49,809
a perplexing problem for a new developer

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:51,789
this is why we need community I'm still

00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:53,529
learning

00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:56,409
hope I'd never give up the title of

00:22:53,529 --> 00:23:00,100
learner because I find that it allows me

00:22:56,409 --> 00:23:01,929
to be kind and generous with myself and

00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:05,649
I think the most costly mistake we can

00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:08,919
make is to stop expecting mistakes and

00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:11,769
start demanding for perfection from our

00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:15,100
silly flawed selves in the words of

00:23:11,769 --> 00:23:20,710
Brene brown there is no innovation and

00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:23,859
creativity without failure period so in

00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:26,769
conclusion I wish you tidy development

00:23:23,859 --> 00:23:30,369
environments adorable Django project

00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:34,080
structures internet connection proof of

00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:37,200
velociraptors easy get escape routes

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:41,769
mysterious secret keys and passwords

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:45,190
super smart friends and lots and lots of

00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:55,979
mistakes just hopefully not these exact

00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:55,979
ones thank you

00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:01,019
