[Music]

00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:19,070
so I don't have a lot of slides here I'm

00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,740
just gonna hold this microphone it's a

00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,990
little easier so I'm here to just sort

00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,000
of to cover a few of the so some of the

00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,320
basic some of these things had discussed

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,960
as well so I just sort of skip over them

00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,230
so as I told you earlier orientation is

00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,300
something that we do here at Jango Khan

00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:36,829
excuse me to help new people become more

00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,250
comfortable people who are introverted

00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:42,220
don't like to be in large crowds so one

00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:45,079
of the first things I want to cover is

00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:47,600
issues relating to our COC our code of

00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:50,570
conduct and if you run into any sorts of

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,460
violations there or you feel like you

00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,289
need to report an incident and the

00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,780
reason I point this out in the beginning

00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:58,820
is because one of the primary concerns

00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,739
that we the organizers have for Jango

00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:04,040
Khan is that everyone who is at Jango

00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:06,890
Khan have a comfortable experience and

00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,050
experience where they can learn and and

00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:12,470
meet new people and feel as safe as

00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:14,750
possible and it's not a thing that we do

00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,310
because someone told us we should do it

00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,840
it's not we don't have a code of conduct

00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,729
because everybody else has a code of

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,409
conduct we do this we have a code of

00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:23,930
conduct and we make efforts to enforce

00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:25,369
the code of conduct and to let attendees

00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,840
know that the code of conduct is

00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:28,220
something that we take seriously we do

00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,320
that because it's actually important to

00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,810
us and it is important to us as the

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,430
organizers that each of you have the

00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:37,399
best Jango kind you can possibly have

00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:39,350
and unfortunately if something goes

00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:41,329
wrong which we hope it doesn't we want

00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,950
you to know that there are things that

00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:46,210
you can do so if you go to the Jango

00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:49,000
Khan website and how legible is that Jim

00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:51,649
how eligible is detect on the slides

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,439
okay just what I'm asking Tim because

00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:55,939
Tim's in the back of the room so I'm

00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:57,110
hoping people closer it will be more

00:01:55,939 --> 00:01:59,240
legible for and you bump that up a

00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:02,360
little bit more that didn't help all

00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:04,549
right so if you go to the website the

00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,049
Jama Khan website there's two slash COC

00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:07,850
you'll see the actual code of conduct

00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:09,110
listed there again we want you to be

00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:12,140
safe and have a pleasant time all

00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,880
a-tangle Khan if you feel that you need

00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,560
to say something to someone don't be

00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,950
ashamed or don't be embarrassed about

00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,750
that we literally went through a certain

00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,430
process to have a code of conduct and

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,110
half code of conduct violation reporting

00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,880
mechanisms we did that on purpose

00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,590
because we want

00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,490
you to be able to make use of them if

00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,930
you feel you need to so I I might be it

00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,760
might seem like I'm I'm harping on the

00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,470
point but in a situation with something

00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,610
you feel something goes wrong we want

00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,600
you we want you to be comfortable

00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:42,080
knowing that you can actually say

00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:45,740
something to someone so who do you say

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,870
something to do a little block of text

00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,460
here there here is a list of our first

00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,160
responders and their phone number so

00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:55,190
first name is me I am the large man with

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,210
the red thing on his head so even

00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,040
without a phone number I shouldn't be

00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,760
that hard to find but phones are also

00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,860
useful

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,530
Heather Luna who is one of our definite

00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,960
board members deaf now as you see here

00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:07,460
in the last bullet point Jeff Triplett

00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,290
Jeff Triplett of definite definite is a

00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:11,480
django events foundation North America

00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:14,570
best the nonprofit organization that

00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,520
oversees Django Cohn so myself have

00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,260
there and Jeff for all board members of

00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,180
deafness and so those are contact

00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:23,510
numbers for us you can reach us at those

00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:26,270
numbers by voice or by text and so again

00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,920
just want it to be clear that if you

00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:31,310
feel something has gone wrong who should

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,260
you speak to about it all right so now

00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,790
on to the more fun things about the

00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,370
conference so the idea of staying

00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,750
connected why you here at the conference

00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,940
in some of these things are things that

00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:43,100
Ed mentioned if you want to volunteer at

00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,210
the conference on the agenda Connor

00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,650
website if you go to the website and

00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:47,390
click on the news link there's a series

00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,010
of blog posts there's one about

00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:51,620
volunteering opportunities I think it's

00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:53,030
the title is help run django con and so

00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,860
there's a list of different volunteer

00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:57,170
opportunities there there's also a link

00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,550
to a Google spreadsheet that you can use

00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,890
to sign up for the different

00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:02,959
volunteering opportunities so we all we

00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:05,300
have volunteer opportunities for people

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,430
to be session runners to help introduce

00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,020
speakers and run the different rooms

00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,370
where the talks are going on we also

00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,170
have volunteer opportunities at

00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,940
registration that will sort of fade as

00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,560
the week goes on because people will

00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,570
more people will be here and registered

00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,820
they're also volunteer opportunities to

00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,130
volunteer at the sprints I am also the

00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,020
sprints chair and so again you'll see

00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,100
more of me than you would like to so

00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,560
take a look at that if you're interested

00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,180
in volunteering wanting to learn how a

00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,550
conference runs or how a conference gets

00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,919
organized if you are someone who attends

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,540
a meet-up in your hometown to check

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,550
meetup in your hometown or your whatever

00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,930
your locality is this might be an

00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,870
interesting way for you to see how

00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,700
another organization another group runs

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:45,410
their events and you might get some

00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,460
useful ideas there or it might inspire

00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,590
you to go home and stretch your own

00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,060
meetup I've met people at django con and

00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,160
other conferences who say oh well I

00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,080
don't I live in a small town I live in

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,500
Houston Texas the fourth largest city in

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,060
the country

00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,770
I'm originally from Washington DC the

00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,590
nation's capital I've always been around

00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,970
lots of people but everyone is in that

00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:04,010
situation I know lots of people come

00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,020
from smaller places I've met people who

00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:08,750
said we don't have this meetup or that

00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,520
meet up in my town well maybe you helped

00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,380
organize a little bit at django con or

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,660
another conference get some ideas and

00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,419
then you can get something started in

00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,650
green echo the woods as they say so one

00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:20,210
was it's also a good way to stay

00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,860
connected with other people if you don't

00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,660
know other people here well if you

00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,919
volunteer while you're here there gonna

00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,210
be other people who are volunteering and

00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:29,300
you'll meet make some new friends that

00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:31,370
way with a shared experience the Twitter

00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,740
hashtag I understand not everyone uses

00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,910
Twitter but I've heard on many occasions

00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,800
that Twitter is useful especially for

00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,820
conferences it's a good way to sort of

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,760
keep track of things and to meet people

00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,410
and it's also a good sort of low cost a

00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,669
low effort way to keep up with people

00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:46,130
that you meet so the official Twitter

00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:48,350
hashtag for Django Connie is Django Khan

00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:51,830
you can capitalize it you can not

00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:53,210
capitalize it there's also a slack

00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,950
channel which I believe will link was

00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:56,660
sent out to and so if you're someone who

00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,220
likes slack I wants to use like you can

00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,510
stay in touch with your various

00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,340
conference attendees in the slack

00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,750
channel so these are all good ways to

00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,120
stay connected especially if you're

00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:07,310
someone who maybe isn't super

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,300
comfortable in large physical crowds you

00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,669
can staying connected in this way

00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,770
digitally it can be helpful or if you

00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:14,210
volunteer it gives you a specific task

00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,070
to focus on and you don't have to worry

00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,510
so much about the oh well what do I say

00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,370
to this person you can just focus on the

00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,910
task at hand and work together and make

00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,460
new friends

00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:26,690
teamwork makes the dream work that's

00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:28,669
true that is an actual science so what

00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,050
about your Django con u.s. experience

00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:31,820
what are you hoping to get out of this

00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,720
and again I had people sort of call out

00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,270
you know what are you up and get out of

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,830
Django con so I think it's important to

00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,590
consider what your goals are for Django

00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,520
con while you're here come get a lot of

00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,710
you were here at your first tech

00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,090
conference or your first angle con why

00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,260
are you here what do you want to get out

00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,000
of it so it's a good thing to think

00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,160
about some of the things people caught

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,720
out earlier they're usually a few basic

00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,630
things people are focused on they're

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,480
wanting to learn

00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:57,860
I'm fed up a little bit there we go

00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:00,810
there we go they're wanting to learn

00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,160
you're either doing job searching or

00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:04,770
you're hiring so maybe you're looking

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,870
for a job or maybe your company needs to

00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,620
hire someone and you thought okay well

00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,210
this would be a good place to meet

00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,220
people so is that one of your main goals

00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,960
or are you just trying to sort of meet

00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,280
other people in the industry again I

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,130
talked about people who come from

00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,720
smaller areas maybe you don't have a big

00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:20,670
meetup scene or a big tech scene in your

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,800
city or in your area and so you'd like

00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:24,300
to meet other people so I just sort of

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,040
let that spin through your head as

00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,630
you're here and think okay what am I

00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,250
really trying to do here jangling what

00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,870
am I really hoping to get out of it and

00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,970
just going through that thought process

00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:36,150
will help you guide some of your later

00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:37,790
decisions and then when you're looking

00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,750
at the different talks on the schedule

00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,620
and trying to decide what talks you're

00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,110
going to go to and what you're going to

00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,800
do with your time let those goals be

00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,570
your guide

00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,490
because if you're you know mostly here

00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:49,230
for the learning then focus on the talks

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,370
that are going to let you learn the

00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,840
things that you want to look like is

00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,190
even a goal like learning while you're

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,470
trying to learn more technical things

00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,570
are you trying to learn more soft skills

00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,280
I did you recently become a manager or a

00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,720
tech lead and now you're trying to

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,730
forget well how do i how do I even

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,350
people I don't know how to people I

00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:06,090
would like to learn how to people better

00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,570
so they're gonna be some talks that will

00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,340
help you with that

00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:12,030
versus wanting to learn more about say

00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:14,970
mmm channels and Django Khan know

00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:18,090
there's a somebody's gonna tear the roof

00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,980
off it don't don't tear the roof off so

00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:22,530
again when you're choosing your talks

00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,790
and your your scheduling just try to

00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,080
think about what your overall goals are

00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:29,040
for the conference and then just make

00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,780
decisions that support that how to ask

00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,180
conference questions and conference

00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,770
etiquette this comes up at a lot of

00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,419
conferences the idea is when you're when

00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,599
someone's speaking there's often an

00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:42,090
opportunity for questions and answers if

00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:45,240
there's a QA opportunity please please

00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:47,940
have a question don't have a comment

00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,700
it's not common in answers it's question

00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:54,780
and answer so please please have a

00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,830
question also comments comments

00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,720
wonderful but said those for what we

00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:59,070
call the hallway track and so the

00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,470
hallway track for those of you who are

00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:03,630
new to tech conferences is the sort of

00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,370
unofficial name for all the things that

00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,900
happen that are

00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,010
in the actual session so just people out

00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,320
in the hallway talking to each other

00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:10,490
that's the hallway track it's it's a

00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,140
much fancier name for what did they

00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,390
actually just it's loitering basically

00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:17,720
what it is people are loitering

00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:19,940
but the hallway track the ordering crime

00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,710
the hallway track fancy tech conference

00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,800
thing so it's better that's better

00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:26,600
that's why we use then so again for your

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,490
jank on us what are you some things you

00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,950
do at lunch people people like food

00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:36,080
right do you like food people people

00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:38,029
like to eat so people have food you can

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,290
make friends at lunch one of the goals

00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:41,060
may be try to sit with people that you

00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,200
don't know and so that way you can make

00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,920
new friends now if you're here by

00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:48,050
yourself that's pretty easy to do but

00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,220
there sometimes is a tendency to try to

00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,810
just sit with people that you've already

00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,940
met if you could try to sit with a

00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:54,290
different set of people each time you

00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,790
have a meal it's a good way to meet new

00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,710
people make new friends talk to folks

00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,300
that sort of thing I realize that can be

00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,460
a little uncomfortable sometimes you're

00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,500
like okay coach oh you're up there you

00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,460
got a big red head on and you want to

00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,980
just sit with strange people that's fine

00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,500
for you but not for me well all right

00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,190
just give it a give it a try once see

00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,140
how it goes

00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:15,020
if you don't burst into flame then maybe

00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:17,420
try it again and again if you're really

00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:19,550
anxious about being of strangers you can

00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:22,070
probably find me again I'm easy to find

00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:23,870
but I'm one of the organizers most of my

00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,310
friends who are organizers so we'll

00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:27,980
probably have a job for you to do so

00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:32,480
just keep that in mind but the

00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:33,800
invitation is open lightning talks the

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,560
lightning talks is Ed mentioned a good

00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,820
way to get started one of the reasons we

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,230
do this sort of thing is to help people

00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,330
come into the community and become

00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:42,740
contributors to the community and so

00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,810
lightning talks are a good way to do

00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,040
that a short talk registration

00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,260
information for the lightning talks will

00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,610
be available soon it hasn't been if

00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,720
you're wondering well I haven't seen it

00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,370
was because it hasn't been released yet

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,040
that's fine that would be coming soon

00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:56,930
but consider giving lightning talk it's

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,750
a five-minute maximum I am also the

00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:03,800
lightning talk share so again I'm

00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:04,310
everywhere guidebook if you have we have

00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,350
a mobile phone

00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:08,360
which I think most of you do there's a

00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,130
guidebook app that you can get and the

00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,450
guidebook app will have a lot of

00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,980
information the nice thing about the

00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:14,810
guidebook app is you can go through see

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,730
the schedule for the conference and then

00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,720
you can select different sessions that

00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,160
you want to go to

00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,970
create your own personalized schedule so

00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,199
that way you'll have your own

00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,939
personalized schedule of the stuff that

00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:24,199
you want to go to you can see easily if

00:11:22,939 --> 00:11:27,759
you've got schedule conflicts that sort

00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:30,019
of thing so a guidebook is helpful I

00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,569
think in the selection which I mentioned

00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:34,519
before and then other events so there's

00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:36,139
some other things going on besides just

00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:37,670
the specific conference itself

00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:39,139
Monday night we're having the Welcome

00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,360
Reception Monday night that's tonight

00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:43,399
actually so we're having the Welcome

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,319
Reception which I type these in the past

00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:48,949
and now it's now it's the present time

00:11:45,319 --> 00:11:51,379
travel it's hard so there's a welcoming

00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:53,720
reception going on tonight tomorrow

00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:55,430
night Tuesday night is board game night

00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,000
and so I think there's information about

00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:00,680
that on the on the website as well I

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,660
personally I have a laptop that I use

00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,189
for playing video games I might bring

00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,889
that to the gaming night because you

00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:09,050
know a game is a game it's a it's it's a

00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:12,920
board game it's on a on a motherboard

00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:17,600
but still a - still the board game I

00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:20,990
think that's that's the thing and then

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:24,620
Wednesday night there is an event

00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:26,000
happening off campus the one of the

00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,559
local newspapers is hosting an event

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,660
here and there's information about that

00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:33,139
on the Jenga what jongguk on website as

00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:35,360
well so final thoughts and I have this

00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:36,709
in big giant letters because it's I

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,839
think it's some important bears notice

00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:40,519
with the organizers honestly want you to

00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:42,279
have the best and most fulfilling a most

00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:45,230
informative time you can at django con

00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:48,829
that's literally why we do this like

00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:51,470
most of us aren't from Spokane or even

00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:52,759
from Washington State or really most of

00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,800
us are from the Pacific Northwest I

00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:58,309
think there's like two of us maybe from

00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,379
the Pacific Northwest and so like this

00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:02,329
is far from where I live and from where

00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:04,069
my bed is and and this is true for most

00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:06,350
of the organizers and why do I say this

00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:08,870
I said it's because just to sort of

00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:11,389
emphasize the point we really truly

00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:13,699
honestly want you to have the best

00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:15,199
experience you can hear and that's why

00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:16,970
we've organized a conference and that's

00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:19,459
why we've done all this and so if you

00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:21,410
have questions if you have concerns if

00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:24,880
you're just confused or don't know where

00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:27,079
to go or feel sad or you know whatever

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,179
talk to one of the organizers talk to

00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:31,220
someone we've got the the little red

00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:33,920
badges that say ask me or the

00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:35,120
bright-green was to say organizer we

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,140
want you to have the best time possible

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,910
so please keep that in mind any

00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:43,880
questions or any questions anyone has

00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:45,800
you can ask me now in person or again

00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,320
I'm big an obvious and easy to find

00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,270
you can also find me on Twitter I'm

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,240
transition on Twitter or you can find

00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:55,910
another organizer so with that if anyone

00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:59,270
has any questions that means I've been a

00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:02,060
wonderful job and I'm the best maybe

00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:03,260
that might be a little far but so with

00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,540
that said we're gonna wrap up this

00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,910
session and the keynote is happening

00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:10,880
here in the next few minutes next 15-20

00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:12,740
minutes or so so let you all relax and

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,210
look at your laptop and your mobile

00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,420
devices because that's what we do now in

00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:19,580
2017 so thank you very much for your

00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,050
time and most importantly thank you for

00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,610
attending Jango Khan it literally

00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:24,440
doesn't happen without you all other

00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,970
without you all this just like me and

00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,020
the other organizers just hanging around

00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,640
on the internet talking to each other

00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:30,950
and that's that's a whole different

00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,670
thing so thank you for your time and

00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,670

00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,929
