	DjangoCon US 2017 - Don't Use My Grid System (or any others) by Miriam Suzanne

I built Susy, a Sass grid system that can generate any grid technique you like â€” but I havenâ€™t used it in years. Iâ€™ll show you how various grid systems work, and how to avoid using them. For those few cases where a grid really is required, weâ€™ll talk about the best ways to roll your own, so youâ€™re not relying on a bloated library to make decisions for you. Weâ€™ll also look at the new layout toys, from flexbox to CSS Grid, and how to get started with only a few lines of code.

When to use floats, CSS Grid, flexbox, custom properties, and other techniques.

How to make grid-math simple, and lose the grid-system.

How to make existing grid-systems work for you, when youâ€™re stuck with them.
