Title: DjangoCon US 2017 - Alexa... by Heather aka. Heats
Publication date: 2017-09-07
Playlist: DjangoCon US 2017
Description: 
	As the universe of IoT continues to grow at a rapid pace, our abilities to interact with these devices can be useful. As an added bonus, developing these skills can be fun too!

Iâ€™ll take you through my journey of developing my first Alexa skill in Python for Amazon Echo devices aptly named Happy Days. It is a random quote generator that delivers positive quotes. Iâ€™ll go over the skills of how to get Python to talk to Alexa and how to dump that code into Lambda for a seamless delivery between Amazon Web Services and the Alexa Skills Kit in just a little over 200 lines! Never developed an Alexa skill before? Donâ€™t worry, I hadnâ€™t either. Iâ€™ll provide plenty of resources to help get you started on a path youâ€™ll never want to leave as an Alexa developer.

00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:21,500
what up my name is Heather Luna most

00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:25,850
people know me as heats don't even ask

00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:28,730
that's a really long story so my talk

00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:30,950
today is about alexei development

00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:35,450
does anybody developed an Alexis goal

00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:39,739
before in the audience looking at you be

00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:41,300
nice and who's it for

00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:43,550
I just want to know who's like a

00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,789
first-time developer just beginning with

00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:48,739
development no judgment because I'm in

00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:52,629
the same boat cool

00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:56,899
so you're you'll enjoy this and what I

00:00:52,629 --> 00:01:02,870
and if you don't the doors there no I'm

00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:04,730
stating so basically I work for Penn

00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,000
even though I just moved to Seattle they

00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:11,060
were nice enough to let me keep my job

00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,120
so there is this initiative for 2020 to

00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,890
move completely into the cloud as most

00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,560
if they're I know there are people here

00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:22,759
that work for universities it's slow

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,939
moving but this is my complex thought

00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:28,700
processes like I see our data centers

00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:30,500
and I see clouds and I'm just like what

00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,500
am I going to do how am I going to

00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,930
prepare myself for this and the thought

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,479
came into mind to start Alexa

00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,909
development the reason that came into

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:44,360
mind is cuz it's not just Alexa

00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:47,869
development at least not what I did so

00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:51,020
it kind of dives into AWS a little bit

00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:54,590
which I'll talk about heavily using

00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:57,280
lambda for the skill that I created I

00:01:54,590 --> 00:02:00,500
got some experience with cloud watch

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,170
which is basically how you can find out

00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:06,469
your errors so it's a good debugging

00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:09,590
tool so I'm gonna show you a roll

00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:11,720
involved with cloud watch so there are

00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:14,000
other things that I was getting into and

00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,610
of course the Alexa skills kit which

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,820
gets married to lambda so the two can

00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:21,650
talk together so one thing I wanted to

00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,430
talk about is a lot it for me has

00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:26,530
changed since the last django con

00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,840
we had Jango Khan in Philadelphia last

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:34,299
year and when Tim approached me about

00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:36,939
Jango I was like what's a Jango so after

00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:38,500
the first conference I got into the

00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:41,709
conference thinking I could never do

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,900
this I'm not that smart and then we have

00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:45,519
an incredible team of volunteers and

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,340
stuff and I thought I would give it a

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,780
shot one thing I like about this

00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,730
community and the people sitting in

00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,599
front of me is that we are probably one

00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:57,879
of the awesome communities in code

00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:00,299
Python Django is supportive no one has

00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:02,950
ever looked at me like hey you're stupid

00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:05,500
everyone's always got suggestions on how

00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:08,400
to make things better so that's why I

00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:11,079
decided to write this skill in Python

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,819
there's also not a lot of Python Alexa

00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:15,849
skills out there I'm hoping that that's

00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:19,620
going to change you'll see throughout my

00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:22,000
talk I do give my github account I

00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,129
encourage you to look at that because

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,470
I've actually included the whole Happy

00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:29,349
Days skill and the components of that

00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:31,900
skill in my github feel free to use it

00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:36,579
as you wish it's out there so that

00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:39,010
hopefully you can use parts of it next

00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:40,720
slide I'm not a developer at least I

00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,150
didn't think I was I'm a systems

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,840
administrator working in to the

00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:51,879
developer space after this I think I'm

00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:54,819
aspiring now so building a skill helped

00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:59,590
me in a lot of things like I said I was

00:03:54,819 --> 00:04:01,780
touching lambda cloud watch was looking

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,370
at billing alerts which by the way if

00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,680
you're setting out to do this for the

00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,930
first time I highly suggest doing that I

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,650
set up my building alert to tell me if I

00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:13,329
went over $1.00 which has happened so

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,250
it's only two dollars and seventeen

00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:16,720
cents for me to run happy days but when

00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,030
I was doing this I didn't want to go

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,110
back to my husband and me like so this

00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:25,000
happened and we owe a ws 10 grand or 1

00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,650
billion dollars I didn't know what was

00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,789
going to happen when I went down this

00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:32,860
road so in building this skill I was

00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:34,690
noticing a lot of things I was able to

00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,180
troubleshoot my own code a little better

00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,540
cloud watch logs are really good and

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,930
show

00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,370
you exactly where you failed I was

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,340
seeing a lot of red though I'm not going

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:49,000
to complain the the code that you're

00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:52,120
about to see is only 200 lines 200 lines

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,680
took me a little two in it a little over

00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,620
two and a half months to do and get

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,090
through the Alexus kill process but

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:04,030
that's just because I'm a noob and it

00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:05,980
took me a while so if you don't know

00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:11,860
what Alexa is she's the voice service

00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:15,600
between behind the echo show the echo

00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:18,070
the echo look the dot anytime you call

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,230
Alexa I think she is muted right now

00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,790
which was great I learned that in other

00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,860
talks that I had given to meet her

00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:26,920
because I say the name more than once

00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:29,850
and it provides for custom developed

00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:34,240
skills Amazon doesn't call them apps

00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:37,090
their skills so you can use an API

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,920
through the Alexa skills kit to build

00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:42,730
your own skill give me about whatever

00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:45,460
you want whatever you want you can also

00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:47,410
leave things in development or you can

00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,930
choose to publish them if you're

00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,490
publishing them Amazon developers go

00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:55,060
through and they pick apart your skill

00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:57,760
which is not a bad thing at first when I

00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,290
submitted this skill and I got feedback

00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,980
I was like God didn't do it right the

00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,870
first time

00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,850
but then someone pointed out to me like

00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,950
this is a professional code review you

00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:08,770
can learn from it I was like okay that's

00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:11,620
pretty cool um so what I've done so far

00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:13,930
is I've published happy days I did I

00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,300
started that directly after the last

00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,460
django con conference cuz there were

00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,170
just so many positive things being slung

00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,330
around and I was like I'm gonna do a

00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:25,840
positive quilt generator and it's gonna

00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:28,840
be awesome and it was and then I've also

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,660
developed a Wharton guide that was for a

00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:34,390
quarterly that we did that remains in

00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,190
development if you decide to leave your

00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:38,530
skill and development you can still

00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:40,390
access it because it links directly back

00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,890
to your Amazon account so if you're not

00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,810
comfortable or you don't want to go

00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:46,300
through the publishing process with

00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:48,460
Amazon you can leave it in development

00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,840
there was a senior software engineer

00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:54,350
that decided to go home and

00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:56,300
a skill for his family so that would be

00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:59,540
an example of what you might want to

00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,650
leave in development or if you didn't

00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,910
want to publish the Wharton guide

00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:05,740
because then you would have to get the

00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:09,320
OK from all the people at Penn yeah

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:10,880
what will I make that was I knew I

00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,350
wanted to do this but it took me a while

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,330
to figure out what I wanted to make

00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,949
because that's a creative thing and

00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:18,290
that's up to you do you want to make

00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:21,139
something that helps people I know I do

00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:22,520
which is why I made it or like I said do

00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:25,310
you want to leave it in development do a

00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,810
family thing that works too the only

00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:29,479
thing you have to keep in mind in this

00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:32,360
process is that the content that you're

00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:34,100
making is going to be consumed by users

00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,010
of the product so you want to be

00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:39,050
thinking through voice design is the

00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,419
voice design that I'm making easy for

00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,490
the user to get through chances are if

00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:47,360
you're fumbling with the voice design

00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:49,580
your users gonna fumble too so as most

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,970
people know customer service is my

00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:55,970
biggest biggest biggest thing for me so

00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:59,150
I was very careful with that as I made

00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:03,080
this skill what did I need to make this

00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:05,780
happen it wasn't hard you need an Amazon

00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,389
developer account that's free you need

00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:12,260
an Amazon Web Services account that's

00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:15,530
also free and for those of you who don't

00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:17,930
know amazon offers a free tier amazon

00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:20,990
web services you can use their services

00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,940
most of them for free for a whole year

00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,919
so if you're looking to get into the

00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:27,200
Amazon Web Services space this is the

00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:30,200
perfect way to do it if you haven't done

00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,510
it already it used to be that you needed

00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:36,800
a device to test you don't need that

00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:38,390
anymore you can use echo sim IO and by

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,950
the way I will be uploading these in the

00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:42,229
speaker deck there's a lot of URLs

00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:44,390
embedded in this presentation that will

00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:48,380
be helpful so I'll make sure I get them

00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:51,589
up on speaker that tweet about it yeah

00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:55,339
so you just hit the login for the echo

00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:57,320
sim ties in to your Amazon account so it

00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:59,030
kind of works the same it's just a

00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,450
little clunkier because you have to push

00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:03,730
the button say Alexa open blah and it's

00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,860
not it's not as

00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:08,350
quick but that's another option you have

00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:13,060
if you don't feel like getting an Alexa

00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:15,160
device but they're cool so get one I'd

00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,230
also like to point out that in no way I

00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,940
have no ties with Amazon my husband

00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,579
works for Amazon that's basically it

00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,490
so this is just me being excited about a

00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:26,170
product and kind of running with it

00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:28,560
building alarms like I said make sure

00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,730
you set those up before you get started

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,589
especially if you're going to be using

00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:35,589
some resource-intensive things if you

00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:39,279
decided to use s3 buckets with a high

00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:40,839
availability that may not fall under the

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,720
free chair in fact I'm pretty sure it

00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:46,839
wouldn't once you start consuming

00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:50,800
services that have a lot of stuff I

00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:53,560
think RDS might also be one of those

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,570
things that are not included but baling

00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:59,350
alarms so you don't have to be like this

00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:02,589
guy let's get it done I mean this is

00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:05,079
what I this is what I used I mean Python

00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:09,010
3.6 is available now in case you didn't

00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:10,600
know for lambda it had previously not

00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,430
been available when we were all waiting

00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,279
with bated breath and then it happened

00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:17,230
we really blew it's here but if you're

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,790
not a Python person you can do it in

00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:24,430
nodejs c-sharp or you can do it in Java

00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:27,040
we're using lambda and cloud watch again

00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:29,040
there's tutorials on this the way I got

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,540
started was the color skills tutorial

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,510
and there's actually a blueprint for

00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:37,600
that in lambda functions which I'll I'll

00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:41,170
click over to real quickly to show you

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,690
before we go in and make a skill my my

00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:45,699
goal today is to get a skill up and

00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,800
running that doesn't exist yet so we'll

00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:49,959
just use the code from happy days and do

00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,630
happy days test and we'll call it that

00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:57,160
way it shouldn't take too long probably

00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:59,380
10 minutes if you can believe it there's

00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,560
other stuff the Amazon developer forums

00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:05,589
are amazing they have their own Alexis

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:09,130
section if you're struggling with a part

00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:12,490
in your alexa code you can ask them

00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:15,350
there's also office hours where you can

00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:20,360
talk to real alexa developers at amazon

00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:22,820
and so that's 4 p.m. 1 to 4 p.m. and

00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,560
then 4 p.m. on the East Coast time it

00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,950
works out for me a little better now

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,200
that I'm a West Coast er so the anatomy

00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:33,800
of happy days like I said there's my

00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:37,220
github there so there's a repository for

00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:39,020
the skill happy days dot pi is actually

00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:43,220
going to be the lambda code that I am

00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:45,860
dropping into lambda the intense they're

00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:48,230
just they're just JSON and that's what

00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,090
the user wants to do what is the intent

00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:52,880
here what are we trying to solve for the

00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:56,810
user the utterances are the actual

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:59,810
phrases that you would give to Alexa so

00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:02,450
if I said Alexa open happy days that's

00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:04,550
an example of an utterance now you'll

00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,350
see when I get into my utterances which

00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:09,500
I'm going to show you this list is very

00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:11,630
short the working guide utterances there

00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:14,300
were over a hundred so the goal for

00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:16,730
utterances is to think about your user

00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:19,550
how many ways could they ask for my

00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:21,350
skill to do something and the list can

00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:24,920
grow extensive depending on what you're

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:27,500
doing and then the more quotes dot pie

00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,570
that's in there I had received some

00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,190
feedback that somebody had heard these

00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:35,630
quotes a lot and they were a little

00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:37,310
bored so I was like okay I can do

00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:40,970
something about that so I think I added

00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:43,850
another 50 quotes and in adding stuff to

00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:48,260
lambda it's actually really easy I don't

00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:50,870
suggest editing your code live possibly

00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:53,930
setting up test environment make sure

00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,520
that it works if you're doing it live it

00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,660
means you're doing it live if you change

00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,570
it it's going to change it on the

00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:01,370
platform for this I thought I know what

00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:04,100
I was doing and I did because it didn't

00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:07,670
break but probably not best practice if

00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:10,760
you're just getting started putting it

00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:14,150
all together I'm going to actually run

00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:17,630
through very quickly the code behind

00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:20,410
happy days and it's only 200 lines so I

00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:23,920
promise it's not going to be painful

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,920
that's the hope

00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:31,520
so here's what I got going on I'm doing

00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:34,400
from future imprint function because

00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,170
when I did this it was in Python 2.7 and

00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:39,470
I wanted to pull the functionality of

00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:42,110
Python 3 over you'll see when we get

00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:44,270
down into the code a little more that

00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:47,270
I'm using this print function a lot it's

00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:49,190
needed because this is kind of how alexa

00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:52,190
deals with their responses and things of

00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:54,590
that nature so you'll see that when we

00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:56,330
move down further I'm doing import

00:13:54,590 --> 00:14:03,940
random isn't you might have a guess why

00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:09,290
I'm doing import random no okay oh yes

00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:11,420
yeah when I was when I was doing this I

00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:14,270
didn't want her to spit out the same

00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:16,310
stuff every time so I did import random

00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:21,200
so I could randomize the quotes there's

00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:23,450
a lot of them there's a lot what do you

00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:27,140
notice about what do you notice about

00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:28,070
these quotes that they're basically in

00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:30,530
plain text

00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:32,630
Alexa reads text as if you would write

00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:35,870
it as if you were writing a book if you

00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:37,430
put a comma she's gonna pause before she

00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,960
goes on to the next thing she say if you

00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:43,270
put an exclamation point you get a

00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,270
little extra excitement out of her so

00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:50,230
so you can really mess with her voice

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,140
now I've gotten some feedback that

00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:54,670
Alexa's voice is so robot tore and

00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:58,390
things of that nature and it's like I'm

00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:59,890
sorry I didn't make her but there's some

00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:04,720
some cool things that people have done

00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:06,760
in regards to recording something so you

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,700
would record something like an intro a

00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:11,080
lot of people do this with podcasting

00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,390
you would store that file in an s3

00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:16,750
bucket and then you would work with the

00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:18,910
audio player in the Alexa skills kit so

00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:23,170
that your recording actually talks and

00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:27,790
Alexa doesn't that could ensue some

00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:29,890
costs so I'm gonna scroll down here I

00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:32,740
hope this is big enough for everyone to

00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:35,410
see and giving these talks I've realized

00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:39,970
that code can be small so I went ahead

00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:42,070
and zoomed in anyway so basically what

00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:44,380
we have here is where to finding our

00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:47,260
lambda handlers these are really

00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:50,980
important because this is how this is

00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:53,650
basically how Alexa handles code this is

00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:58,630
how she handles sessions launches and

00:15:53,650 --> 00:16:04,750
things of that nature let me just keep

00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:09,430
sure so if I were you right now and you

00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:11,980
were basically in my github I would

00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:16,450
definitely just basically copy and paste

00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:19,839
lines 78 through 91 and you can add to

00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:22,270
that if you don't have the event

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:25,750
handlers it's not going to work this is

00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:28,540
this is really needed so you can see

00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:31,450
launch requests that's basically oh well

00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:34,180
let me say that the one above that is on

00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:36,790
session started on session started is

00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:41,080
when I say Alexa when I say Alexa that

00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:44,589
session starts the launch part is when I

00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:48,730
say open happy days so then she's going

00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:51,459
to launch my skill the intense

00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:54,579
is how she's going to handle what we

00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:57,490
need to do and the session ended only

00:16:54,579 --> 00:17:00,399
happens at the end if a user says stop

00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:03,250
cancel that's when your session ended

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:10,569
happens and that's when the session just

00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:13,449
ends you're no longer in it so yes so on

00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:15,790
intent and things of that nature now

00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:17,410
here I'm defining my intent

00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:20,980
you're going to see these come up when I

00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:24,939
go into the Alexus skills kit portal and

00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:27,100
this is where they get matched so I have

00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:31,059
the Happy Days intent which is linked to

00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:33,460
the welcome response the Amazon no

00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:36,130
intent you can you you can choose to not

00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:38,740
define the no intent but it's built in

00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:41,559
so if you don't define anything for it

00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:46,500
that's fine you don't need to because

00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:50,440
it's built in same with the yes the know

00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,669
the help I have another quote intent

00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,799
because I thought well a lot of

00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:55,720
someone's not happy enough and they want

00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:58,750
a second one then they have another

00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:01,450
quote intent the cancel and stop intents

00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:04,049
are the same they're built in you don't

00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:06,400
have to define them I believe that I do

00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:09,340
so this is where I'm defining my get

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,760
welcomed response notice I'm leaving my

00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:14,620
such session attributes dictionary open

00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,900
the reason that I'm doing that is

00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,940
because throughout this skill it needs

00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:21,220
to pull down the information from one

00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:23,890
block to the next if I were to put stuff

00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:26,110
in there she she would just not she

00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:28,510
would just stop working so you'll see

00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:30,640
that I keep these brackets open

00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:33,340
well the curly braces I guess I would

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,250
keep these open until the end when I'm

00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:40,570
saying session ended is when you'll see

00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:43,900
this actually have more than just

00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:46,179
nothing in between them so the random

00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:49,559
number this is where I'm using the

00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:52,419
integers and grabbing the random quotes

00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:55,690
you'll notice here in my speech output

00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:58,059
which is what she's actually saying she

00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:00,850
can speak the logic which is really

00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:02,330
pretty cool she knows now that she needs

00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:04,429
to go up into my

00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:07,789
list of quotes and she need she can pull

00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:10,370
whatever she wants it has to be one she

00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:13,340
knows she can do that and then she knows

00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:15,890
how to say it and then she goes into

00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:18,080
would you like to hear another quote you

00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,940
can see I have sure then session is

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,690
false because she needs to stay in

00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:25,490
session if I had this is true Alexa

00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:28,000
would stop and if somebody wanted to

00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:30,350
hear another quote well too bad for them

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,360
but for user experience

00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,639
she's staying false this was also

00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:37,460
something that if you do decide to do

00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:40,070
your skill you would want to use with a

00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:42,409
help intent because if the users asking

00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:44,299
for help on your skill they're gonna

00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:48,230
need the session to stay open so that

00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:51,080
they can continue to interact so I also

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:53,230
have handling another pull request and

00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,669
she's doing the same thing they're

00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:58,399
handling the help request this is all

00:19:55,669 --> 00:20:00,679
pretty pretty basic stuff all this

00:19:58,399 --> 00:20:03,649
changing here is her speech output and

00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:05,600
her reap rock text the reap romp text is

00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:07,970
if your user doesn't answer within a

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,559
certain amount of time I don't know what

00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,659
that amount of time is but if she's

00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:14,929
waiting for a while she can reap romped

00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:17,559
and say do you still need help whatever

00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:22,010
you want to have her say she can do that

00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:25,130
and here's the handle finish session

00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:27,980
request so as you can see I still do

00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:31,549
have my a tree my ID you still have my

00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:33,200
dictionary open so that was my bad but

00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:36,740
the should end session is true because

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:39,679
at this point we're done we're done the

00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:43,130
build speech lit response something I

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:47,480
wanted to talk about is SS ml the the

00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:49,850
language s s ml you can fine tune Alexa

00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,159
if you're using that for this skill I

00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:54,710
was just getting started so I decided to

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,529
use plain text if you wanted to look

00:20:54,710 --> 00:21:00,500
into SS ml if you know more about SS ml

00:20:57,529 --> 00:21:03,169
over me feel free you'll just have to

00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:05,870
change this output speech and the reap

00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:10,250
romped to SS ml this is where you would

00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:12,710
make that change billing speech response

00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:14,419
without the card I'm not using cards for

00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,440
this because I made this skill before

00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:17,360
the echo show

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,370
came out so anybody know what the echo

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,320
show is so show of hands

00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:23,450
a lot of people don't know what it is so

00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:26,540
Amazon just came out with echo show

00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:28,400
which is a visual box you can use it for

00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:30,470
conference calling but you can also use

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,900
it for skills so the cool thing about

00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:36,920
skills and cards is that you can use

00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:38,930
cards to relay pictures text if

00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,990
someone's hard-of-hearing this is a good

00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:44,630
thing to think about accessibility wise

00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:46,880
someone's hard-of-hearing you can read

00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:48,860
the text on the screen so I'm actually

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,230
really excited about the echo show I

00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:55,100
think that the next skill I make will

00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:57,080
probably have cards and then at the end

00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,670
I have my build response this is

00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,800
important and the reason this is

00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:03,770
important is because this takes my

00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:06,260
session and it transfers it back to the

00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:08,480
Alexus skills kit if I didn't have this

00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,950
it would just stop and Alexa skills kit

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,170
wouldn't be able to pick up all the

00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:14,600
information that we just got throughout

00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:18,320
the 200 lines of code and then she

00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:20,690
couldn't talk say what we did so there's

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,920
that piece that's actual anatomy of the

00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:28,420
code Oh 205 lines cool

00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:33,400
I think the Wharton guide I made was

00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:38,020
probably 600 or so so I'm getting better

00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:41,000
these are the intents for happy days

00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:42,830
these go into the Alexa skills kit and

00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'll show you that later what we're

00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:46,570
going to do is we're going to build a

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,150
skill from scratch it is a live demo so

00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:53,930
bear with me in case things don't go

00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:56,500
very well I thought I had sample

00:22:53,930 --> 00:23:00,080
utterances up I do they're just in this

00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:02,000
so so as you can see these intents are

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,590
really short I don't have a lot if I

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,280
showed you Wharton guide you'd be like

00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:11,480
whoa but that's pretty much it for the

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:14,650
code part now is the demo part and the

00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:17,660
demo parts pretty cool if it works

00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:19,430
fingers crossed so this is the part

00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:21,110
where I think they need to switch this

00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:25,720
on but I don't know where the power

00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:28,960
button is where's the power button

00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:36,009
yes not that she's not loud enough but

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:41,759
she is test yes so if I said happy days

00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:44,320
or Alexa open happy days testing I

00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:47,200
couldn't find any enabled video skills

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:52,990
go to the music TV and books section of

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:57,279
the Alexa Alexis you know I have no

00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:59,500
patience for her lately so we don't have

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,480
a skill yet right so we're just gonna

00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,429
build one real quick because I think

00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,409
it's important that when I'm talking

00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:08,289
about this that I can show you the steps

00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:11,409
needed to take it so we're gonna start

00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:13,419
off with a lambda function so this is

00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:15,519
basically if you haven't been in I feel

00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:17,679
like I should go to the dashboard for

00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:19,570
AWS for those of you who haven't who

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,870
haven't had any experience with AWS

00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:26,730
this is all the services that AWS has I

00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:30,669
believe that lambdas under compute it is

00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:33,519
so I'm gonna go in and these are the

00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:36,340
functions I have already this is in the

00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:37,480
work be ready for that so that skills

00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:40,210
going to be amazing

00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:43,179
once I have time and what's time who has

00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:46,179
free time anymore I'm going to select

00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:49,230
the blueprint what I wanted to show you

00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:52,179
off of this and hopefully I can just

00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:55,990
make this a little smaller so I can fit

00:24:52,179 --> 00:25:01,450
more stuff the color skills tutorial

00:24:55,990 --> 00:25:06,309
that I talked about oh it's not finding

00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:09,429
it that's perfect so lambda has

00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:11,139
blueprints those are basically already

00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:12,429
set up and ready to go you can

00:25:11,139 --> 00:25:14,950
manipulate them

00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:15,730
there is a color skills tutorial in here

00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:21,820
somewhere

00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:25,389
I hope unless they got rid of it oh yes

00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:26,740
who said that you're smart

00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:31,630
thank you

00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:34,990
I see it worked I love a helpful

00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:37,029
audience thank you so if you wanted to

00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:40,450
try out the blueprint that goes with a

00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:43,120
tutorial this is where you would find it

00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:44,649
there's no js' sorry no js' I haven't

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,809
gone into your language yet and I don't

00:25:44,649 --> 00:25:49,299
plan on it anytime soon

00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:52,210
I like to stick in the Python world this

00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:54,100
blueprint still in 2.7 I don't know when

00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:56,799
they're updating it but to just get your

00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:58,390
feet wet go through the tutorial and set

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:02,260
it up you'll understand a lot more about

00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:04,570
how you can interact with Alexa um so

00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:06,429
I'm not going to do that you can do your

00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:08,470
own ones from scratch which is what I'm

00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:11,620
gonna do because I actually have my code

00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:14,799
in another window so the first part of

00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:17,470
this is that you have to basically marry

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:19,029
lambda and the skills kit if you don't

00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:22,059
marry the two they don't know how to

00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:24,909
talk to each other so this is I'm

00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:27,640
setting up a trigger so I'm gonna select

00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:31,120
Alexa skills kit I'm triggering it for

00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:33,580
lambda and I'm gonna go on to next and

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,399
I'm going to name my function I'm gonna

00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:41,169
say happy days testing because that's

00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:46,539
all I use doesn't like spaces that's

00:26:41,169 --> 00:26:50,500
okay and fingers crossed that this live

00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:53,320
demo thing goes well cuz if it doesn't

00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:55,870
we're just gonna move on my run time is

00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:58,059
2.7 the reason I'm doing this for the

00:26:55,870 --> 00:27:02,830
tutorial is I that I know the Happy Days

00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:04,840
code works with 2.7 if anyone has it use

00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:07,240
lambda the way that it works is you

00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,700
basically just drop your line you drop

00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,649
your code in line the cool thing about

00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:14,350
this is you can kind of change code on

00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:19,090
the fly things of that nature so I'm

00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:21,220
gonna do is delete all that I'm gonna go

00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:27,270
back into my Happy Days code and I'm

00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:30,820
just gonna grab it I'm gonna paste it

00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:32,710
and then I'm gonna come down here the

00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:35,500
lambda function and the lambda handler

00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:36,920
are the things that handle your code

00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,560
there's lambda function

00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:42,650
that pie that's actually what's in your

00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:45,140
lambda code I got really confused when I

00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:47,330
was getting errors and trust me this

00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:50,270
being my first lambda skill I was seeing

00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:53,470
red there's only 10 minutes left oh my

00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:53,470
god I better hurry up

00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:59,570
time flies by when you're having fun

00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:01,940
right I'm gonna choose an existing role

00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:03,500
I'm choosing lambda basic execution and

00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,630
the reason that I'm choosing that is

00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,970
because all I need is to be able to

00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:11,120
write cloud watch logs so that I can

00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:12,920
debug I'm gonna go to the next one I'm

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,080
going to look at what's going on here

00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:19,430
yeah that looks good enough and I'm

00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:21,770
gonna create the function yay it has it

00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:24,980
is okay that's great I recommend tested

00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:28,340
the function this is new okay this might

00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:33,170
not work we'll see I'm gonna test it I'm

00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:35,000
sure it's fine bear with me haven't been

00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:38,150
in here in a while this is what I need

00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:42,380
to choose so it should be green yeah I

00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:43,880
knew that was gonna happen I mean of

00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,920
course it's fine I've done this like a

00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:51,800
million times so I think this is fine

00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:54,050
now I am a little okay the AR n is very

00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,790
important here the air and that lambda

00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:57,560
gives you you need to put into the

00:28:55,790 --> 00:29:00,230
skills kit so when you're doing this

00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:02,360
save your air into a notepad file don't

00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:04,160
think about stealing this air in because

00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:12,140
in 20 minutes I'm gonna delete this

00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:13,820
whole thing so that's it that's all I

00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:16,880
have to do on the land decide I did that

00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:18,020
in what five minutes not a big deal so

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,900
now I'm going to go over to the

00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:24,260
developer portal and this is where the

00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:28,040
Alexus skills kit lives oh of course it

00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:37,370
wants me to sign it again cool you go

00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:39,320
into Alexa never mind I'm gonna get

00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:41,180
started as you can see this is where all

00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:45,110
my other skills live it's the land of

00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:48,260
misfit toys so I'm going to add a new

00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:51,260
skill I'm going to name it happy

00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:54,650
is testing my apologies if I'm going too

00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:56,900
fast if you have any like in-depth

00:29:54,650 --> 00:30:00,260
questions I'm always open to answering

00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:03,440
them Heather at Luna dot pH is where I

00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:07,490
can be reached so now it's good so I'm

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:12,770
gonna save and then I'm going to go on

00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:15,470
to the next so this is where you enter

00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:18,350
your intense which I hope are up and

00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:21,860
they're just the ones that you saw in my

00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:25,220
code so it's like a game of matching if

00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:29,150
you think about it so that just goes

00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:31,550
there those are slot types I did not use

00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:34,310
them and I'm not gonna explain since

00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:40,070
we're running out of time the sample

00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:44,290
utterances are gonna go in that's cool

00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:44,290
cool I'm gonna go next

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:54,230
No cool everything is gravy great so

00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:57,890
where do you think my errand goes I'll

00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:59,930
tell you it goes right there that's

00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,730
where that comes in I'm selecting North

00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:03,290
America

00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:05,900
unfortunately the Alexa skills kit right

00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:09,680
now is only available in North America

00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:13,370
and Europe I know that they are working

00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:15,680
on that account linking if you somehow

00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:17,390
wanted to charge people for your for

00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,850
your skill this is what you would do you

00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:26,180
would link to your Amazon account Amazon

00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:27,200
store and that's how you would do it and

00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:29,210
that's basically it

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,730
I'm not going to go through the service

00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:34,400
The Voice simulator this is how you

00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:36,890
could test what's going on what I will

00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:39,860
show you hopefully on the next page if

00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:42,320
you decided to publish this is what you

00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:45,410
would do you give testing instructions

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,750
for the Alexa crew and all that stuff at

00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:50,110
this point she should be ready to go so

00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,110
fingers crossed

00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:58,760
Alexa open happy days testing here's a

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,590
dose of happiness the purpose of our

00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:03,240
lives is to be happy Dali Lama

00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:07,810
would you like to hear another quote no

00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:09,360
I would not here's a dose of happiness

00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:13,850
[Laughter]

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,850
[Applause]

00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:20,580
so she doesn't understand no I would not

00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:22,260
because I would I did not make that as a

00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:24,779
sample utterance which is why she is

00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:26,760
being silly so because I'm running short

00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:27,390
on Dwight n did I have ten minutes left

00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:30,659
at all

00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:31,860
and then I can ask questions yes still

00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:34,919
have time to get through the really good

00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:37,309
stuff not that that wasn't good stuff

00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:40,289
come on

00:32:37,309 --> 00:32:43,440
so like I said I'm gonna get back into

00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:46,200
the presentation now yeah you have to do

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,549
code reviews so I was like I finished

00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,529
and I was like great this worked it

00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:51,600
sounds great this is amazing and I

00:32:49,529 --> 00:32:53,490
submitted to Amazon and they're like no

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,140
no they're like you forgot a Help

00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:59,370
section you forgot this you forgot that

00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:01,590
I was like oh this stinks so I did

00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:03,690
theirs and I got another stuff back I

00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:05,490
got another email response back from the

00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,980
Alexa team and they were like oh and

00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:15,210
this this is - no I was like is this

00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:17,760
ever going to happen oh okay this is

00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:19,320
actually when you know they were like

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,159
yeah it's great we're publishing it and

00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:24,870
I was like that is really cool stuff

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,970
when you're publishing just remember

00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:30,720
you're putting it out there you're

00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:32,760
putting it out for haters have some it's

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,130
fine but there's some constructive

00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:37,230
feedback there the feedback about adding

00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:39,330
more quotes that weren't so popular I

00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:41,010
took that and I implemented it into my

00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:44,340
skill because I'm like huge on customer

00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:47,419
service and everybody gets kind of like

00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:51,150
a happy face even though I might be like

00:33:47,419 --> 00:33:53,420
just like thank you for your feedback

00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:55,799
[Applause]

00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:57,360
nice thing about Amazon that they're

00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:59,040
doing right now is if you decide to

00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,500
publish a skill this is not with

00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,510
development if you decide to publish a

00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:06,330
skill you get swag if you fill out a

00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:08,399
form so I actually took a peek at this

00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:09,629
month's wagon it's for those of you that

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:19,679
like socks

00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:21,720
I mean it's publishes skill but is that

00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:29,909
up is that not coming up that's

00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:33,840
interesting okay it's not bringing up

00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:36,000
the webpage I can't show you these cool

00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:38,970
socks that stinks but if you publish a

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,600
skill you they'll give you an echo dot

00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:46,080
and dev swag and the dev swag is binary

00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:49,550
socks from Amazon Alexa so that's pretty

00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:51,720
cool all you have to do is publish

00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:55,340
promotional credits is something that

00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:58,020
was recently that was recently let out

00:34:55,340 --> 00:35:00,240
if you have a skill and it's published

00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:02,550
you are you can get up to $100 a month

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,590
for your skill if you're using heavy

00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:07,440
resources and things of that nature

00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:09,119
Alexa the Amazon team's main thing is

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,500
they want people to build skills and

00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:14,340
they want to give you the tools to

00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:17,970
enable you to do those things I have a

00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:21,930
giveaway today I have no affiliation

00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:24,119
with Amazon none this is just we use

so that's my giveaway and that was

00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:01,369
really rushed

00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:06,479
okay so now I'm going to open it up for

00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:16,229
questions yeah I guess you're going to

00:36:06,479 --> 00:36:23,279
need this here yeah first yes will

00:36:16,229 --> 00:36:25,079
clapping fantastic presentation it looks

00:36:23,279 --> 00:36:28,079
like you're writing pretty much directly

00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:29,940
to a lambda your code here is there

00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:33,239
potential here to write the Django of

00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:36,029
Alexis skills there is a flask a skill

00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:38,700
and this was more the example that I saw

00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:40,890
for Django flask ask which I think was

00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:43,890
from John Wheeler was more of a trivia

00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:47,519
based tutorial and what I'm doing was it

00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:49,319
trivia so the color skills tutorial that

00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,059
I did was more in line with what I had

00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:52,680
seen for this project but if you wanted

00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:55,470
to do a trivia skill and you want to use

00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:57,749
a Django tool flask ask is probably the

00:36:55,470 --> 00:37:00,529
best bet for that I was wondering how

00:36:57,749 --> 00:37:02,700
long she can talk first some of your

00:37:00,529 --> 00:37:04,170
quotes I'm guessing or like a one-line I

00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:07,099
didn't know if it cuts off after certain

00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:10,200
amount and just how to deal with

00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:12,150
pronouncing weird names or whatever so

00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,219
yeah so that's part of the testing fees

00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:17,880
that I did is listening to how she says

00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:19,859
stuff sometimes it doesn't it doesn't

00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,930
come off like I want it to and then I

00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:24,719
kind of have to tweak like if you were

00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:27,539
if you saw pronunciations and how things

00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:30,650
go like in the dictionary like if you

00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:34,529
type that out she would do it for sure

00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:37,859
there's an inspire me a skill I almost

00:37:34,529 --> 00:37:40,170
just called it a nap sorry Amazon but

00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:43,440
that goes on for a while those are

00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:45,509
actually like live talks from people and

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,089
things of that nature and podcasts can

00:37:45,509 --> 00:37:49,859
go on for a while too basically she's

00:37:48,089 --> 00:37:53,609
not going to stop until you tell her to

00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:58,049
so they could go on forever just be just

00:37:53,609 --> 00:37:59,999
be ready for that bill from AWS um

00:37:58,049 --> 00:38:01,710
expand on the cloud front again I don't

00:37:59,999 --> 00:38:04,140
know if you showed us if there's an e

00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:09,089
trail that how do you hook up cloud

00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:10,559
front to the lambda and then cloud cloud

00:38:09,089 --> 00:38:13,240
watch so when you're doing a basic

00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:15,520
execution roll that I showed it's

00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:19,930
just gonna do that anyway I'm hoping I

00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:23,290
can just get out of my slideshow now so

00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:26,950
I can go into oh yes here see socks and

00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:31,000
an echo so if I wanted to go into cloud

00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:32,440
watch I would go into the dashboard it's

00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:38,740
already hooked up I'm just come here to

00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:43,450
services Club which monitor resources

00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:47,200
and application like Alexa hopefully it

00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:51,400
doesn't take long to load oh look I went

00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:53,830
over my estimated charges that stinks so

00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,300
oh so I don't have anything set up right

00:38:53,830 --> 00:39:04,300
now but this is where you create a

00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:10,180
dashboard for cloud watch I can't scroll

00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:12,610
down what is happening so if she were to

00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:15,160
have messed up that you would see cloud

00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:17,290
watch logs and they would point you to

00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,270
the line of code where there was an

00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:20,950
issue I guess what I'm trying to get at

00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:22,660
is is there a way to do almost like web

00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:24,340
analytics on this where you can see how

00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:27,730
many people are using it and when are

00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:30,910
they using it so there's actually a

00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:33,250
metrics in the Alexa skills kit that you

00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:36,400
can go into it tells you how many unique

00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:38,109
customers what they're calling my

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,200
numbers are down right now because this

00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:44,530
hill has been out for a while but I'll

00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:48,700
show you if I still have the Alexa

00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:53,230
skills kit open which I do I'm just

00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:56,680
gonna go back in so this is where you

00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:58,480
would go for that the metrics so as you

00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:00,580
can see it can tell you how many unique

00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:04,510
customers the sessions the number of

00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:05,920
utterances and you can do your time here

00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:07,810
if you wanted to know how many people

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,880
had done it in the last 30 days you

00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:12,040
could do that there's a lot of

00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,140
flexibility in here that wasn't in here

00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:16,720
when I first started making it so I'm

00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:18,220
really glad to see that Amazon has

00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,590
changed their stuff and made it more

00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:23,109
user friendly so this is where you would

00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:25,990
go for the information like that this is

00:40:23,109 --> 00:40:26,950
how I found out by the way I noticed in

00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:29,050
my metric

00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:33,099
not long after I did this that I had

00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:34,960
spiked up to like maybe 30,000 users at

00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:37,599
one point and that's how we found out

00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,660
that I had been published somewhere so

00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:42,730
it's cool to look at that and see so I

00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:44,500
think PC Mag published is one of the

00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:46,480
best looks of skills I'm sure they

00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,940
changed your mind by now people are

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,280
constantly constantly creating Alexus

00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:53,050
skills which is just something for me

00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,940
saying hey it's time to get back on the

00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:57,430
horse and make another one which trust

00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:59,589
me there's something up there yeah my

00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:02,410
question is about the utterances so you

00:40:59,589 --> 00:41:05,619
say you have to specify each one

00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:08,050
separately yeah so is there any facility

00:41:05,619 --> 00:41:10,089
where it can kind of figure out what

00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:13,630
you're saying like show me the weather

00:41:10,089 --> 00:41:15,369
versus what is the weather you would

00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:18,609
have to account for both of those

00:41:15,369 --> 00:41:20,920
addresses okay because as you see when I

00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:23,440
when I told her earlier I forget what I

00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:26,050
asked her to do she didn't understand so

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,369
that's why uh Turin says you want to

00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:29,260
think and you want to use as many

00:41:27,369 --> 00:41:31,900
utterances as you can to support your

00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:35,020
user base how do you how do you get

00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:38,319
noticed in the Alexus like skills store

00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:40,450
so if you hit publish and people are

00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:43,630
giving you high stars I think that for

00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:45,460
right now and you're going through the

00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:47,829
process with the Alexa Dev so they're

00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:49,329
seeing what you're making if they think

00:41:47,829 --> 00:41:51,400
it's good enough they're gonna put you

00:41:49,329 --> 00:41:53,349
in this store which is also what I found

00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:56,200
out that at one point I was on the front

00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:57,910
page of the Alexis girl store so if they

00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,440
think that your skills good people are

00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:01,089
using it and people are liking it

00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:05,530
chances are that's where you're going to

00:42:01,089 --> 00:42:05,880
end up all right let's give it one more

00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:15,369
hand

00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:15,369
