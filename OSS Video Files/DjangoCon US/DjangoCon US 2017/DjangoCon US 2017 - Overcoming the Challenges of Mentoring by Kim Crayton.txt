	DjangoCon US 2017 - Overcoming the Challenges of Mentoring by Kim Crayton

​There is an ongoing mantra within the developer community: that there are far more jobs available then programmers to fill them. Which should be an indication as to the wonderful potential for both business and those learning to code. Yet what often follows such statements are not words of joy but rather a list of frustrations related to the difficulty in finding and retaining enough skilled developers to fill these positions. The challenge is not in the number of newbies entering the field but the number who leave because they are not able to bridge the divide between bootcamps, online tutorials, books, videos, etc. to an employable developer who is able to contribute to the team. Kim has years of experience working with learners of various ages in helping them develop the skills they needed to be successful at whatever their chosen goal. She understands that for businesses to be successful, they must develop more effective and efficient ways of recruiting and retaining developers in order to meet organizational benchmarks. The developer community is a overwhelmingly generous one and a well designed mentoring or apprenticeship program could be one answer that business leaders and newbies are looking for.

The business costs associated with corporate hiring managers inability to recruit and retain skilled workers to fill current and future entry-level positions are increasing (Queen, 2014).

89 percent of organizational leaders stated that they are having difficulties filling open positions, which is causing them to either turn down orders, miss key deliverable deadlines or hire individuals from outside of the United States (Aho, 2015).

00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:36,100
this stuff by the way please tweet I

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,980
need people to know that I exist

00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,840
so Kim Creighton one that is my main

00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:43,690
Twitter we'll be talking about junior

00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,550
dev mentoring which is my mentoring web

00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:49,930
site and slack teen we also have

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:56,280
community engineering report which is my

00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:58,510
new podcast that talks about community

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,460
diversity community and safe spaces in

00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,360
tech from an economic standpoint I'm not

00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,430
going to argue with you about your

00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,590
politics not gonna argue about your

00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,670
morals it's about your bottom dollar so

00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,950
if you want to be able to compete you

00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:12,280
need to have diverse perspectives and

00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:15,759
inclusivity on your teams I do a

00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,469
training that helps people transition in

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,729
text so I'm using the hashtag team in

00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:21,280
the Wild West because this is what this

00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:23,139
is there is no path to this it is taming

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,509
the Wild West and because of all the

00:01:23,139 --> 00:01:27,490
crap I see on Twitter and whatnot I've

00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:28,659
just started just putting up we can

00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:30,609
hashtag we can do better

00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:34,539
I don't even respond it's just hashtag

00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:36,369
we can do better that's how I roll I am

00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:38,979
a community engineer and if you don't

00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:41,670
know what that is I was speaking at a

00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:44,380
closure West Conference and one of the

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,549
attendees came down and he said I have a

00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,789
name for you because at the time I was

00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:51,060
like to figure out is that me what am i

00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:51,060
doing

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:01,510
okay all right so he said in community

00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,850
he said where it engineers your

00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:05,560
community in generic sound good so I

00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,660
went to research the words I am a a

00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,869
researcher so words mean something to me

00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:13,330
so community engineer to me is that

00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:17,470
person so community is that heart stuff

00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:18,430
the he8 RT that's the mission that's the

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,760
stuff that makes people feel really

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:25,420
really good oh but it usually guess you

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,580
know where it's the engineering that you

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,150
need to make the engine the heart stuff

00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,130
work

00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,920
it's the operationalizing your mission

00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,660
your vision your goals that's where

00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,430
people make a mistake so you'll put your

00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,350
there put their vision in their mission

00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,490
statements on their websites but just

00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,430
because you put it there that doesn't

00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:44,680
mean anything so that's what a community

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,990
engineer is and I added this to my

00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,020
slides today because I am transitioning

00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:53,650
I am in the last few months of my

00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:58,180
doctoral program I am thank you for

00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:59,739
those who clapped I am my thesis mice so

00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:03,910
a doctoral program is different from a

00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:07,180
ph.d program I have a DBA because PhD is

00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,500
theory I'm all about practical I'm not

00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,350
trying to test theories I'm trying to

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,090
put theories into play so this my topic

00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,950
is successful strategies for increasing

00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,680
organizational knowledge sharing through

00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:20,200
mentoring junior developers that's what

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,230
my topic is about and so I'm class of

00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:28,090
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:32,580
my story started August 14 2014 it

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:35,410
started before then but it started with

00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:39,160
I've always been a tech person I was the

00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:41,410
person who would go to watch the Apple

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,269
Keynote not just to see what was coming

00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,100
out next but to see why did they put

00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:46,750
that but there why didn't they do that

00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,220
and they always had a reason other

00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,450
people didn't like it sometimes but who

00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,700
cares but at least that gave me a reason

00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:53,410
it would drain battery life it did this

00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,030
did that and those are the things that

00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,220
are reported to me so if I had to build

00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,000
a website I mean I just went to youtube

00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,650
father and found something Google um

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,720
WordPress found some good themes and

00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:07,240
just it took me days because I had to

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,370
stop and do and stop and do but that was

00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,050
kind of techie I was I never saw myself

00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:14,710
as a producer of tech but I was more

00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,490
than a consumer attack in 2014 as an

00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:20,260
only child

00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:22,540
my worst fear came I thought the death

00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,640
of a parent were really just not me out

00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,640
and my father and I lived together and

00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,480
so he died of cancer in 2014 but I

00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,870
didn't die

00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:36,100
and so it's let me to think let me back

00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:40,450
up I was an educator as a high school

00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:45,790
teacher I don't like your kids I don't

00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:49,810
like your kids let me I really don't

00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:51,160
like your kids and it's a most of this

00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,770
because you can tell them how special

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,900
they are and they're really not they're

00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,010
special to you and you really need to

00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,570
get them ready for the real world

00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,670
because everyone wants to complain about

00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:04,140
Millennials but you got them believing

00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:08,200
that they're so freaking special and so

00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:10,990
I don't like your kids okay so after

00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,910
that I was like I didn't die I'm gonna I

00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:18,790
don't like these kids so I'm gonna leave

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:21,580
so I went away to okay my clicker is not

00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:26,080
working so I went away to Maui for a

00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:28,990
week yeah exactly I went away to Maui

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,930
for a week and as I was crying and

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:34,690
snotting and surfing and snotting and

00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:38,200
crying and I had an epiphany I said

00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:40,090
screw this I'm going into tech so I sent

00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,950
back a text message to the people who

00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,930
were care and I said I'm going into tech

00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:45,700
and yes I put it in quotes because I

00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,200
said when I figure that out I'll let you

00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,970
know

00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:51,220
that's what it meant to me I had no plan

00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:54,390
again this is the one I had no idea what

00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:56,890
I was doing so when I came back home

00:05:54,390 --> 00:06:03,100
this is gonna be interesting so when I

00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:05,110
came back home I ended up immediately

00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,720
going to workshops and conferences and

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:10,120
and and meetups in Atlanta I mean

00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,890
Atlanta is a thriving community so for

00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:17,500
the first six months I was like a kid in

00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:18,870
the candy store Mike ux/ui what I didn't

00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,880
know that thing had a name

00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,260
in Internet of Things oh that thing has

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,270
a name cuz I was playing around mean I

00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,010
knew about connected technology I knew

00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:28,169
but I never I was putting names on

00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:31,710
things I was just like in all the for

00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:35,040
six months and so I believe so

00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:36,930
also I was for the first time being

00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,419
black female in the South was working

00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,830
for me I mean I was rocking it I was

00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:42,360
getting yeah girl I was getting free

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,639
tickets to everything I wasn't paying

00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,020
for anything I was going to conferences

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,030
I went to my first JavaScript conference

00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,889
didn't even know what JavaScript was I

00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:51,330
was just sitting there like at some

00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:53,160
point some of this is gonna make sense

00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,860
it really didn't but I was there anyway

00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,300
and so I was like okay and so I was

00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:05,970
going I was just doing all kinds of

00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:07,229
things because check yeah check you got

00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:09,389
some free check check

00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:11,250
yeah I mean I was just going for it so

00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:14,910
it was like I just felt like a superhero

00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:18,240
I was like yes I'm a black female you

00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:20,669
got something for free get this way so

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:43,919
that's what I did until people kept

00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:45,539
seeing coding is not easy which led me

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,289
to write this blog post stop lying to

00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:50,880
newbies just stop doing it you're doing

00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:55,169
them a disservice you're doing the

00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:59,220
industry a disservice because this

00:07:55,169 --> 00:08:01,440
shit's art learning is hard periods

00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:04,830
learning of language is even harder and

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:07,950
so we and you devalue what you do when

00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:09,539
you tell people that this is easy maybe

00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:14,870
you forgot what it was like when you

00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:17,970
first started but this shit's hard and

00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,530
we need people we need to stop doing it

00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:24,080
for the reasons that we need people in

00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:26,460
the industry there are jobs everywhere

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,289
you know you hear this mantra oh my god

00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,559
there's so many jobs we can't find

00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:33,110
qualified people to fill them oh my god

00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:35,449
so many jobs I can't cover like oh my

00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,099
god it's like shut up already we heard

00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:38,959
you there's so many jobs you can't find

00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:45,680
people to fill them what are you gonna

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:47,569
do about it besides wine the challenge

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,009
is not the number of newbies that are

00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:51,680
coming in the field it's the number of

00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:52,100
newbies who stay in the field that's the

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,290
problem

00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:57,110
we don't have a great way of helping

00:08:54,290 --> 00:09:00,199
people acclimate to this this Wild West

00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:02,269
there is no path if you do this at every

00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:04,160
talk can you raise your hand if you

00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:05,930
think of in the industry where you get

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,819
hired and you're not supposed to be a

00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:10,189
professional when you're hire you're not

00:09:07,819 --> 00:09:12,800
supposed to be an expert just don't

00:09:10,189 --> 00:09:14,540
think I could think of not only are you

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,100
not only supposed to be an expert when

00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:20,689
you're hire but you can't make mistakes

00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:22,730
because that's liable so even when

00:09:20,689 --> 00:09:26,300
you're a custodian they expect you to

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:29,120
know how to mop when you get the job but

00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,980
this is a thing that is just so you know

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,600
I want to make this thing has never been

00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,980
made before I know it's a few lines of

00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,779
code let's figure this out let's google

00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,910
it let's stackoverflow it whatever your

00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:39,800
get your heart not to be an expert in

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:43,250
whatever this thing they may need you to

00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:45,410
create so that's that's overwhelming for

00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,569
a lot of people particularly career

00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:50,420
changes where you've had to be expert

00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:53,839
your whole life and I have particular

00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:57,649
problems with some of these uh resources

00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:00,740
here and I'll just boot camps I have a

00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:03,139
problem boot camps and I'm happy that

00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,300
some of them are closing down because if

00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:07,839
I pay fifteen thousand dollars for a

00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:10,189
course there is no child left behind

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,259
you're gonna figure out how to make this

00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:14,480
work for me and the reason that that

00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:17,059
model is not working because it only

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,620
works for a subset of people it works

00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:20,569
for people who have some kind of

00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,459
technical engineering background who are

00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:25,910
looking to be focused and can handle a

00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:28,069
12 week 16 with whatever accelerated

00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,470
program but if because it's not enough

00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:32,720
of those people they start ringing the

00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,860
marketing and sales people to reach out

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,350
to people who don't even know what a

00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,519
variable is and there is no way a person

00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,040
who doesn't know what a very royal

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,439
function is on day one is going to do

00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,490
well in a 12-week accelerated class

00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:44,120
where every two days they're learning

00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,530
something new

00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,300
it's not gonna happen so you've just

00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:49,040
wasted their money and most times you

00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,260
require them to leave their jobs as be

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,130
do this thing full-time and I find that

00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:58,120
a great disservice you need to be

00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:58,120
definitely put out of business for that

00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:05,920
and again the developer community is

00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:08,780
also overwhelmingly generous so you have

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,550
this pool of people who need your help

00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:12,440
and you have this pool of people who

00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:14,960
willing to help they just don't know

00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,690
really how to help because they see

00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,540
mentoring as this V over whelming thing

00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:22,010
and again the researcher II mean this is

00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,380
the some research that I've been I've

00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:26,090
collected myself business costs

00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:28,070
associated with corporate hiring

00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:31,780
managers inability recruit and retain

00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:34,940
skilled workers to fill current jobs is

00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:38,320
increasing the fast pace and uncertainty

00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:40,730
of today's economic climate have

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,950
business leaders turning to mentoring as

00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,440
a strategy for increasing organizational

00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,400
knowledge or knowledge sharing and

00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,520
organizational leaders have reported and

00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:52,930
this is a big number the ineffective

00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:57,320
employee mentoring and inadequate

00:11:52,930 --> 00:12:01,610
knowledge sharing is costing 331 point

00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,870
five billion dollars per year now if

00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,850
that doesn't hit you in the pocket I

00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:07,130
don't know what does so this is not a

00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:09,260
moral issue it's not a political issue

00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:14,270
it's a business issue it's costing

00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:15,950
businesses money so what we're going to

00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:19,040
talk about is I like to break this down

00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:20,420
into four quadrants we're talking about

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,070
the difference between personal and

00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,410
professional mentoring and youth and

00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:26,000
adult mentoring so we're going to so

00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,790
those are the quadrants and we're gonna

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,860
start with the youth mentoring youth is

00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,990
focused on them when I'm mentoring a

00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,090
young person somebody under 18 years old

00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,680
it's not about Kim it's about making

00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:38,360
sure I provide that person with the

00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,780
skills that they need to become a

00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:45,320
taxpaying law abiding citizen hopefully

00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:47,570
happy that is my goal what I find is

00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,180
when I take on that person when I take

00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:51,950
them home and now I need to mentor these

00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,300
nuts at the house cuz this explains why

00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:56,110
this person is acting this way

00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:59,980
so that's a lot to take on

00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:02,500
and it's personal you know you end up

00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:05,290
going to people's graduations and and

00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,320
going people's birthday parties and just

00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:10,870
being with the family and you just like

00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:15,070
be with you but you have to do this for

00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:18,850
this young person adult mentoring is

00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:21,250
different adult mentors usually focus on

00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:23,860
a specific career thing they're trying

00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:26,170
to accomplish so it's not this and this

00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,209
nebulous ongoing thing it's something

00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:31,360
specific it's focusing on making them

00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:34,750
better at doing something and it's you

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,700
know acquiring knowledge and skills best

00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,170
practice it's mutually beneficial I

00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,940
don't have to go to Thanksgiving dinner

00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:43,540
with you but I do at least have to like

00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:45,010
you mentoring that doesn't Avenue I have

00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:52,540
mentored some people and I'm just like

00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:54,490
Lord but because it was like them I had

00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:57,399
to suck it up but if there's another

00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:59,440
adult and I don't like you deuces out of

00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:01,420
here and so that's what that is and

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,060
adults can be in the role of mentor

00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:06,130
mentee or both you see that when people

00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,570
are learning I might have this skill so

00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,740
I'm gonna help you with this but I don't

00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:13,839
have this skill so can't you help me

00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:15,130
with that so it goes back and forth we

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,920
talked about that personal mentoring

00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:21,250
that's that whole oh come over to meet

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,390
my grandma it's her 70th birthday

00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,800
then you thinking about what am i

00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:25,600
bringing this gift of this woman I've

00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,170
never met that that you know this is all

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,630
this stuff

00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:34,149
not with professional mentoring um it's

00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:37,209
the best Mitch ring to me is an

00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:39,640
apprenticeship program it's where you

00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:41,230
bring people in we have and we have the

00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,850
history that we have tons of research

00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,339
they've the main apprenticeship programs

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,810
or I mean from the Middle Ages and

00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:49,120
beyond I mean these are things that we

00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:52,120
know how to do we need to apply them to

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,100
development because they're defined

00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:59,160
goals and objectives again that's the

00:14:54,100 --> 00:15:02,050
engineering part how do you take cut it

00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,690
how do you take tacit knowledge from

00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:06,459
someone who knows it and technologies

00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,649
that learned experience which is

00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:09,820
different from explicit knowledge so you

00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:11,830
want to take that knowledge

00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,780
someone as it has because they learned

00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:17,680
it in experience how do you transfer

00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:20,470
that to someone else that's what that's

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,410
the challenge but if you have identified

00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:25,150
goals and objectives it's easier so

00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:27,370
we're gonna focus on and I'm gonna stop

00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:29,410
it's not easier it's less challenge it's

00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,910
gonna be done don't like that word all

00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:33,310
right so we're gonna focus on adult and

00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:37,290
professional tell about what mentoring

00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:41,950
is not mentoring is not stackoverflow

00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:43,600
mentoring is not slack stackoverflow and

00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:46,540
slack is like when my house is burning

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,800
please put it out particularly for a

00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,420
newbie who does not know what they're

00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,310
doing everything is a fire that needs to

00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,750
be put out so you need to think about

00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:55,870
that when you're on when you're

00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:58,780
providing assistance first of all don't

00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:00,370
be jerks on stackoverflow if this is a

00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:03,190
question that they've asked that

00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:05,410
somebody asks before just direct them so

00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:08,230
you don't have to be snipey about this

00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:10,480
is an appropriate blood but there is

00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,800
there are no rules when you come to

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,200
stack overflow cause most people have

00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,390
googled it so that's my issue with stack

00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,880
overflow for all you if I'm offending

00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:21,160
you I don't care so all you people who

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:26,680
have who are you know stack overflow

00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:29,230
like guards if there was a when I

00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:32,170
googled it it sent me to a page with

00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:34,000
some rules then I would say fine but

00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:35,860
since it takes me directly to the answer

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,210
I'm looking for and it might not have it

00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,260
then you need to get off these people's

00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,910
back because they don't know what that

00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,680
is they've been told to Google they

00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:44,050
don't know that there are rules on Stack

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,680
Overflow also when you're doing this

00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:50,170
what I had many times I'm somebody's

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,450
working with me and big I've chopped up

00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:54,370
my whole coal-based I'm just that China

00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,850
and then they die I don't know where

00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,320
they went

00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,430
I don't know if they got off work I

00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,570
don't know what they just leave they

00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,710
don't say goodbye they're gonna say I'm

00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,150
leaving they don't say nothing you just

00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,260
sitting there with now this code that

00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:04,680
you don't understand because they made

00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:08,050
you change it and you just gotta

00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:10,300
hopefully you you get so you can roll

00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:12,820
back something but the check yeah

00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:15,610
exactly but a newbie using get come on

00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,990
what no so they have to start over and

00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:20,320
they have no idea what they're doing so

00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:22,600
Stack Overflow and and slack

00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:25,870
there's a fire my house is on fire

00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,189
help me and there there's it's Mitch

00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:29,410
means changes

00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:32,380
so what mentoring is is a relationship

00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:34,960
that's one of the reasons I built junior

00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:37,360
deaf mentoring it was a website where

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:41,169
people can make a commitment for a year

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:44,530
to mentor or mentor someone what I found

00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:46,570
was a challenge but people again this

00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,549
people don't know how to ask for

00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:51,400
mentoring they don't know how to give I

00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:55,440
have people coming up to me Kim where

00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:58,720
you mentor me know who the hell you are

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,630
so you asked me to give my time you have

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,179
no defined goals what do you want to do

00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:08,919
web development do you know how broad

00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:11,230
that is it's like no that's no no so

00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:13,419
what started to stack the slack channel

00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:15,789
that it's very active is to allow people

00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:17,860
to get on there and put out fires while

00:18:15,789 --> 00:18:19,630
building relationships so then they can

00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,010
get a mentor and then they can move to

00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:23,020
the website and make a commitment

00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,780
because people are having trouble

00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:28,780
figuring out how to build relationships

00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:30,640
you know people go to this whole going

00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:32,530
to meetups and passing out cars that

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,820
just by I am an introvert and that just

00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:36,100
gets on my nerves don't hand me your

00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:38,020
cart of corn it in the garbage can don't

00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,490
know who you are I've connected nothing

00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,990
to you we need to have a meaningful

00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:42,850
conversation or something for me to

00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:44,830
connect who and what you are and what

00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:46,780
matters to me and if what you're doing

00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:48,970
fits in what I want to do so it's a

00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,289
relationship and like any relationship

00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:51,520
that you value I don't know about your

00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:53,679
personal lives but I'm sure there's one

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,929
relationship that you value you put in

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,880
time you respect the boundaries if

00:18:55,929 --> 00:18:59,830
you're not gonna be there you say hey I

00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,659
need to reschedule you don't just drop

00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:03,429
the ball you don't just ignore people

00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:05,500
even on the mentee side when there's

00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:07,590
work to be done you do it you get it

00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:10,570
done you don't waste people's time and

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:12,250
it's a it's a commitment it's like it

00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:14,380
could be it could be as short as you

00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:18,820
know what I'm gonna mentor you on this

00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:20,409
thing for I have let's say I have six

00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,370
months but at six weeks I know big

00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,080
projects coming up

00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,429
give me tell me something you're working

00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,809
on it so I can see if this fits in my

00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,760
schedule then I can work around how we

00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:30,400
can do that that's how adult mentoring

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,929
works and it's professionally

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,940
transformational because I can tell you

00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:37,130
I know very few newbies who get

00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,210
developer jobs without somebody stepping

00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,350
in and helping them out because they

00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:44,450
don't even know where the pitfalls is

00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:45,950
it's like you're just walking on yeah

00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,840
people need to know from these newbies

00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:49,970
there I mean it's like you're forever

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,150
walking on line on my fields you're just

00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:55,310
poof poof and you're like what it's like

00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:57,050
ridiculous you don't know a thing that's

00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,820
going on your face is getting blowing

00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:00,110
off your oh you have no limbs you're

00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,180
just walking around like this and

00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:04,100
everybody's like you look weird yeah cuz

00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,680
nobody will help me you know it's like

00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:10,400
step in and help but you don't know how

00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:13,730
to do it so I get it this is why you

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,920
should do it mentoring the role of

00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:18,860
mentor you need to understand that it's

00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:22,070
vocational support you're providing

00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:26,210
psycho psycho social supports role

00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:28,730
modeling and I'm gonna a caveat if you

00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:31,520
don't like people please stay away from

00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:34,100
newbies a bad mentor is worse than

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,800
having no mentor at all I'm going to

00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:39,470
repeat that because some of you will not

00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:43,580
hear it a bad mentor is having no mentor

00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:45,290
at all evaluate your motivation honest

00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:48,020
assessment of your time your talent and

00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:53,270
your temperament realistic set realistic

00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:53,630
goals and give them examples and for the

00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,880
Mitte

00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:58,820
reciprocity respect the relationship and

00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:01,130
identified goals

00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,930
okay mentee mentors have no mentees have

00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:04,220
no idea whether a realistic goal is

00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:06,080
because people have lied to them so much

00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,490
about how easy it is they think they can

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,620
go to the moon tomorrow they have no

00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:11,780
idea so it takes somebody to come in and

00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:13,370
say hey no you can get to the moon but

00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:17,120
you're not gonna get there tomorrow we

00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:19,340
can you know step by step and then we

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,380
say why reasons why development

00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:23,690
community needs mentoring we talked

00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,670
about all those things Mentors it's it's

00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:28,310
all about economics people need to be

00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:30,290
able to level up and positive mentoring

00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:32,060
relationships for those people who think

00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:34,430
that bringing in the mentor mentee and

00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:37,910
they're going to leave if you have a

00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:41,210
positive culture that supports positive

00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:42,680
mentoring newbies would not leave they

00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:45,470
will appreciate what you've done for

00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:47,150
them and they will stay longer then

00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,240
because who wants to go to another job

00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:50,400
you don't know what that

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:54,810
and it might be even worse so think

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:57,450
about that myth imposter syndrome is my

00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:59,580
pet peeve newbies do not have impostor

00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:01,380
syndrome you don't know

00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,480
you can't be it you can't be in the

00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:07,260
posture and pasta Sonoma for people who

00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:09,090
have skills who still doubt their skills

00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,830
but if you don't know anything you can't

00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:12,720
have a pasta syndrome you wouldn't tell

00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:15,780
a baby oh you have a pasta sin gentleman

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:18,060
because you can't roll over I mean

00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:20,010
that's just absurd they just don't know

00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,510
you don't know a variable you it's not

00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:23,370
like you're making I'm not joking I

00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:25,500
don't know what this thing is so if you

00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:27,150
see any mint mint um young newbies

00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,470
saying that they're having pasta because

00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:30,240
everybody must have this label for some

00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:34,790
reason please correct them they do not

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,940
have impostor syndrome how much time

00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:43,170
okay

00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:45,630
we started late okay well oh my now yeah

00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:48,150
exactly um we started a little late so

00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:49,650
okay that is it I have the slides

00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:52,490
because there's some other stuff on here

00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,490
so thank you

00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:02,690
so the cool thing is Kim because you

00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:06,880
booked into a break we can definitely

00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:10,460
talk about your developer survey results

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,930
okay so it's bright time but let's just

00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:14,180
do it let's go for it all right

00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:16,040
so this is from Stack Overflow because I

00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,630
I mean they have great information and

00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,850
this is what people need to understand

00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:22,130
it's a misconception that most people

00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:23,900
have CS degrees when you go to get a

00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:25,460
computer science degree they're teaching

00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:29,360
you a different skill you're learning

00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:30,890
how to solve problems algorithmic lis so

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,200
they're using Python or whatever they're

00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:35,780
using to solve problems and night.they

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,550
the language they're using is for them

00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:39,650
like writing a pill or using a pencil

00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:41,090
you you're not the pill so you're not I

00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:43,010
don't know how to make a pill so I use

00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:44,330
pencil to write stuff down so that's why

00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,500
they're using code so that's why I'm

00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,000
glad to see us people come out and they

00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,200
don't know how to code either because

00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,900
that's not that skills they're focusing

00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:53,240
on but most people are a self-taught and

00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,650
so we need to employers need to

00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,540
understand that that's what it is most

00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:59,450
people are self-taught and most people

00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:00,710
have less than eight years experience

00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:03,890
but if you look at it most people have

00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:06,170
less than three years experience and as

00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:09,410
you know it takes between I would say

00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:11,510
two years solid of somebody working with

00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,900
some really say they can develop their

00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:14,120
coder

00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,950
I really would because they you're being

00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,960
hired as a developer to solve problems

00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,610
and a newbie you can't solve problems

00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,960
you can't somebody can give you some

00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:23,210
code and you can fix it if it's broken

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,590
but no one can get the chances of

00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:26,540
someone giving you a blank slate and

00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:28,490
saying this is the problem solve it it's

00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,170
very slim if you're a newbie so that

00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:31,370
takes about again that's that tacit

00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,520
knowledge you have to do some things

00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:36,020
build some muscle to be able to get that

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,700
so people are saying you know a formal

00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:40,160
education is not very important because

00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:44,030
we as we see there's a lot of free stuff

00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:46,820
out there so most 90% of people are

00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:49,940
self-taught I don't know how they got to

00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:51,740
125 percent on this but 125 percent of

00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,970
people have been through mentoring

00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,670
programs and that has made them

00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:58,280
successful so if 125 percent which is

00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:59,930
over 100 but people say that that's what

00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,700
successful why aren't we doing this more

00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:04,550
it doesn't make sense why aren't we

00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,930
doing this more and so I say use

00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:07,400
project-based learning so I'm going to

00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,690
give you an example of how to use this

00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,720
as a project-based learning

00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:12,140
someone says I'm just gonna say

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,700
web-development

00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:15,470
it's too broad but we're just gonna use

00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,660
this an example so we already know to

00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,630
somebody to be an effective developer of

00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:22,160
web development they need to know CSS

00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:24,820
HTML and JavaScript at least minimally

00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:27,710
right so what I would do is say hey

00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:29,780
project-based learning here's a document

00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:32,000
they had some text on it we're just

00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,500
gonna start with HTML put some tags on

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,180
it and then they have to come back to me

00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,710
explain why they use those tests as

00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,360
opposed to other tags because that lets

00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:40,790
me know what they've learned do they

00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,550
understand how the tags are used then I

00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:45,170
would say okay now add some color to the

00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:47,630
background or some other stuff so now

00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:49,580
I'm bringing in CSS but because it's

00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:51,860
learning you take two steps for your

00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,510
gonna take ten steps back they're not

00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,740
gonna remember attacks so that's why

00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,300
they need the time so they need to

00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,470
that's why I don't like boot camp says

00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,210
you don't get the time to turn the

00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:01,370
figures you're just doing this a lot you

00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:03,760
just don't know what's going on so then

00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:06,650
they add some color and then you say oh

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:09,290
let's use the box method we'll be right

00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:10,880
there just just totally demoralizes a

00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:12,560
lot of people because now you got to

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,360
deal with margins and figuring out if

00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,650
what if this margin is this padding is

00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,720
this but I don't know what this thing is

00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:20,330
so you do that thing then once think it

00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,280
then you said hey let's add a click

00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,660
event that's it you don't just give them

00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,850
a whole project and just say you just

00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:27,560
add you keep skits call scaffolding you

00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:30,440
just keep adding to so what I need you

00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:33,050
to do is that box that we just did let

00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,610
make let's make that a button and so

00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:36,080
then they go into the job you know they

00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:38,150
learn a little JavaScript and then they

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,470
make that a click event and then oh and

00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:41,900
then you just keep adding on to that

00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:44,540
that's how you do make the mentoring

00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:46,940
very make it manageable you make it

00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:52,850
measurable and people know it's very

00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:54,350
objective it's not subjective and this

00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:56,510
is what I would usually do an assessment

00:26:54,350 --> 00:27:00,580
but we don't have time I'll take any

00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:00,580
questions later but thank you again

00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:07,250
if you would like to get involved this

00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:10,509
is how you get involved

00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,509
