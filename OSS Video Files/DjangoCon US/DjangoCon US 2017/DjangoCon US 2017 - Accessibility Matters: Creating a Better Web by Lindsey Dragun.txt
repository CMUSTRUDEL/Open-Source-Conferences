Description: 
	DjangoCon US 2017 - Accessibility Matters: Creating a Better Web by Lindsey Dragun

This talk will go through accessibility concerns on the web through example sites and code with both good and bad accessibility to experience what some users have to struggle with daily. We will cover well-known concerns such as low vision/color blindness and deafness, as well as attention issues and autism, and discuss the limitations and abilities of various alternative input devices that people with motor control issues rely on. Short and long-term fixes will be demonstrated and taught, with the overall goal being that the participants leave knowing how to find and solve accessibility problems.

Why Bother With Accessibility

Not only should you want everyone to be able to easily use your site, but having an accessible website comes with a variety of benefits. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, around 19% of Americans have a disability, which is a large potential audience for any site. Many companies also fall under accessibility laws they might not even be aware cover their products, with lawsuits becoming more prevalent in recent years, and showing a good faith effort to improve your products’ accessibility can help keep your company out of hot water. Accessible web development also tends to lead to better UX and a happier user base. And, another plus: It will save devs time and frustration when they’re working with the code, since good HTML is enforced.

Who This Talk Is For

Anyone who wishes to learn more about accessibility. While we won’t be going over the absolute basics of accessibility in detail, the examples and resources will be easy to understand for people with very basic knowledge of web development.

[Music]

00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:20,779
hi thank you for coming I just want to

00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:24,230
let people know right off the bat this

00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:27,259
isn't all levels talk so I'll be trying

00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:29,300
to cover things that are good for people

00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:32,119
who may not have design or developer

00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:37,070
experience and also cover a few things

00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:38,989
that are a bit higher level just a quick

00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:42,559
overview of what we'll be going through

00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:44,660
I'll give my intro I'll introduce the

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,840
topic and we'll talk about some broad

00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:50,800
ideas and also I'll be giving some

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,199
specific examples that I find helpful

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,300
there will be a bit of code at the end

00:00:53,199 --> 00:01:00,410
to show how to identify an accessibility

00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:02,300
problem and solve it and expect lots of

00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,670
weird stock images and screen caps

00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:08,900
because I don't get a chance to use them

00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:13,220
much this particular presentation will

00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:15,980
not include any animation there will it

00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:18,980
should not rely on any slides and

00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:21,950
they're not really pretty so you're not

00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:26,320
missing much and there will be no cat

00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:29,900
pictures sorry I'm a dog person

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,690
and if you wish to follow along you can

00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:37,600
find these slides at dragon with the u

00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:41,690
dot tech slash django con dot HTML and

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,010
that address will also be at the end so

00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:48,020
don't worry if you want to see them

00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:50,990
later a little bit about me I'm a full

00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,210
stack web developer PBS where I often

00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:56,210
deal with accessibility issues on our

00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:58,910
projects and work closely with our

00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:01,790
product managers and design team to find

00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:04,610
solutions I've also got your standard

00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:08,090
geek intrest like comic books and horror

00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:10,519
movies and whatnot and I also happen to

00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:13,700
have made a career transition into tech

00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:15,500
I have a very expensive MA in

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,260
international peace and conflict

00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,820
resolution and one of the main focuses

00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:23,430
of that is understanding what causes

00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,950
distress to

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:29,099
people even in cultures that don't

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:31,859
resemble ones I'm familiar with because

00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:34,680
resolving conflict often means finding

00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:37,500
what someone needs under what they say

00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,150
they want which happens to be quite

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,950
useful when applied to things like

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:47,609
accessibility and user experience so

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:50,730
let's get into the basics what is web

00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:54,299
accessibility the world wide web

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:56,450
consortium also known as w3c is a

00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:58,769
community that develops web standards

00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:02,340
according to their web accessibility

00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:04,889
initiative okay the people behind the

00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:08,310
web content accessibility guidelines

00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:10,980
aka WIC AG it means that people with

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,500
disabilities can perceive understand

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:18,239
navigate and interact with the web as

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:20,969
well as contribute to it these can often

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,639
be remembered through poor wicked

00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:27,599
acronym for guiding principles of their

00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:30,150
2.0 standards what you put on your

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:35,129
website must be perceivable operable

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:37,739
understandable and robust week AG is

00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:40,790
adopted by multiple countries as their

00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:45,750
standard for accessibility including

00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:48,060
Australia Japan Germany Canada and is

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,620
slowly being integrated into the United

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,699
States government's accessibility

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:58,379
standards under Section 508 or at least

00:03:53,699 --> 00:04:00,239
it was what sort of disabilities do we

00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:02,459
generally mean when we talk about web

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,829
accessibility there are four main

00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,569
categories where some of the

00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:08,430
disabilities you're used to considering

00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:10,709
for web accessibility can fall and

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:14,790
there's also ones that aren't generally

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:17,459
considered there's visual so for example

00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:19,199
blindness and color blindness or very

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,120
common considerations for web

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,729
accessibility but it can also include

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,070
include conditions like glaucoma or

00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:29,009
cataracts which also make it hard to

00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:32,880
view web sites there's auditory and that

00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:35,669
can include issues like deafness and the

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,910
auditory processing disorder but it can

00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:39,850
also include issues like

00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,500
tinnitus where if you require someone to

00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:45,370
listen closely to something on your

00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:48,990
website that might interrupted motor

00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:52,510
includes issues like cerebral Holly

00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:55,180
Parkinson's obviously even things like

00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:59,740
arthritis can affect how people can

00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:04,630
manipulate inputs cognitive includes

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:07,900
that she's like autism or dyslexia and a

00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:10,960
whole slew of other issues and the

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:13,150
language speech category is last one and

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,990
that can include things like select

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,470
mutism

00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:20,350
or stuttering and this is especially bad

00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:24,220
in recent years because of all of the

00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:29,290
reliance on tech that requires audio

00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:32,110
input from users but beyond that people

00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:34,480
also like to separate who we need to

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:37,180
consider for web access accessibility

00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:40,420
into other categories to better

00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:43,330
understand these users David Burton a

00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:45,310
Canadian accessibility expert has taken

00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,950
those other categories people use and

00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:51,310
created this particular list which I

00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:54,880
think works well there's permanent such

00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:58,300
as being born blind episodic which can

00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:01,300
be PTSD or something like a temporary

00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:04,650
illness like the flu there's acquired

00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:07,860
which could be aging related and

00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:10,210
societal for example left handedness

00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,670
because there's a lot of assumptions and

00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:18,640
hardware and our user flows that users

00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:20,920
are right-handed people who need a web

00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,410
accessibility might also be using other

00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,750
alternative inputs and outputs such as

00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:28,060
touchscreens eye tracking and Braille

00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,430
displays and they may also be using

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:33,100
screen readers these are applications

00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:35,590
that read off the content of the page as

00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,480
they navigate through it often with the

00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:40,960
keys of their keyboard instead of a

00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,730
mouse or some other form of input screen

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,370
readers may be used by the blind or

00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:48,190
visually impaired which the National

00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:50,680
Federation for the blind estimates is up

00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:54,490
to 10 million people just in the U

00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:59,080
but can also be used by others who have

00:06:54,490 --> 00:07:01,539
trouble reading or navigating pages but

00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,749
defining people by categories or devices

00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:06,969
can be deceptively simple categories

00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:10,060
often give the impression people can

00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:12,430
easily be placed in just one of them in

00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:15,009
reality people often fit in many of

00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:17,529
these categories after all someone who's

00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:20,499
deaf can become ill and certainly they

00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:22,449
still age they could have cognitive or

00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:25,509
speech or visual disabilities as well

00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:28,000
and they could be using both alternative

00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:31,990
inputs and outputs and various types of

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,349
each well some people need to find those

00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:37,389
as edge cases that's dismissive of a

00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:40,389
very real problem that could come up

00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:43,419
with your design and development as Eric

00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:45,969
Mayer and Sarah Walker Boettcher say in

00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:47,919
their book design for real life it's

00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:51,099
better to think of these situations as

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:53,469
stress cases the moments that put a

00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:58,240
design and content choices to the test

00:07:53,469 --> 00:08:01,379
in real life so what are some of the

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,509
ways you can plan for these stress cases

00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:06,849
your code can follow standards like WIC

00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:07,899
egg but realize that standards are

00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:09,669
generalized

00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:12,219
they're meant to give the best

00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:14,680
experience on average not necessarily

00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:18,069
for your users so you may have to

00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:20,229
consider options they don't discuss from

00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:22,599
a design perspective you can consider

00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:25,270
inclusive design which is sometimes

00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:28,899
known as universal design or design for

00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:31,270
all these are strategy strategies that

00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:33,099
consider accessibility issues to ensure

00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:35,979
that designs work for people with a

00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:37,690
variety of needs and that everyone can

00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:40,110
get a similar amount of usage and

00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:42,669
enjoyment from what they're experiencing

00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,769
you should of course consider user

00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:47,680
experience whether you're a designer or

00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:49,899
not because most actually good user

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:54,160
experience also helps people with

00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:55,480
accessibility needs you should logically

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,209
think through your cases

00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,329
how would users approach what they need

00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:03,220
to do on your site in a variety of ways

00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:03,939
what is your typical user flow for

00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,849
example

00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:09,639
and when might it fail how can you make

00:09:06,849 --> 00:09:12,849
alternatives work and just how

00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:14,470
compassion for your users understand

00:09:12,849 --> 00:09:16,899
that they might not be able to use the

00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,079
web the way you do and accept that

00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:21,999
changes need to be made to assist them

00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:25,209
think about how you can assist people

00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:27,999
who aren't just like you a little

00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:32,009
compassion a little kindness can go a

00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:34,479
long way but even with these basic steps

00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:37,419
accessibility can still be hard to get

00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:39,849
right because it's not easy or simple a

00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:42,970
lot of people when they hear the term

00:09:39,849 --> 00:09:45,579
accessibility think of accessibility in

00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:49,019
the physical world like of a building

00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:52,449
and in many ways there are similarities

00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:55,929
let's imagine some new modern building

00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:58,239
it's done everything right it's up to

00:09:55,929 --> 00:10:00,369
code and then some

00:09:58,239 --> 00:10:03,399
they have why the easy to navigate

00:10:00,369 --> 00:10:06,729
hallways they've got automatic doors

00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,769
everywhere there are ramps instead of

00:10:06,729 --> 00:10:12,279
stairs throughout Lobby

00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:16,239
they've got wide easy to find elevators

00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:18,359
just about everything you could want but

00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:21,549
when you approach this awesome building

00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:25,689
parking in the large very close handicap

00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:29,249
spot you realize there's no ramp they

00:10:25,689 --> 00:10:32,979
have a high curb and no ramp in sight

00:10:29,249 --> 00:10:35,559
they've done everything right inside but

00:10:32,979 --> 00:10:38,379
have overlooked a detail that makes the

00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:41,559
entire building inaccessible from the

00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:44,229
very beginning someone say in a

00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:46,869
wheelchair would get a long client

00:10:44,229 --> 00:10:48,419
inside but they'd have no way to get

00:10:46,869 --> 00:10:52,299
there

00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:55,179
websites can be the same way people will

00:10:52,299 --> 00:10:59,349
run all sorts of tests do all sorts of

00:10:55,179 --> 00:11:02,979
audits on their code get 100% wicked

00:10:59,349 --> 00:11:05,829
triple-a scores but they won't actually

00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:07,899
go through the entire process of using

00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:11,289
their product from the point of view of

00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:14,139
a user with accessibility needs tools

00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:17,300
are not everything tests can this

00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:19,580
issue's and they're often also generic

00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,130
that means they don't know how your a

00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:26,360
particular user is using your particular

00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:29,170
site because the tools you use are not

00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:32,510
the same as a human being using them and

00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:35,839
many of the other tools we use that

00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:38,329
aren't accessibility specific aren't

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,279
just not checking for accessibility but

00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:43,370
they're actively optimizing

00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:45,620
accessibility away the people working on

00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:48,140
them can decide that's something like an

00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:51,290
aria tag that communicates with screen

00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:53,209
readers is just access code and then you

00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:55,160
have to dig through their Doc's to find

00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:57,769
a roundabout way just to keep it

00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:00,110
included so even if your code was

00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:05,269
accessible maybe it's not after using

00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:07,000
certain products and my job we spend a

00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:10,310
decent amount of time working with video

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,490
people come to our website looking for

00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:16,760
video and making sure users can actually

00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:19,550
get to and watch our content is very

00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:22,040
important to us so everyone so while

00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:25,370
we'll do an audit of other sites with

00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:28,399
video not really our competitors because

00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:32,420
no one else is really vying for sweep

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:34,970
fifty-plus demo but whatever major sites

00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:38,120
we can think of and some of them are

00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:40,310
awesome YouTube for example is just a

00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,079
great experience if you want to

00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:45,320
experience video well keyboard

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:47,270
navigating I'd suggest going there but

00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,450
some are coded by people who are

00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:53,089
probably just checking boxes on a list

00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:54,649
on what makes a site accessible or who

00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:58,310
didn't check to make sure the code

00:12:54,649 --> 00:13:00,320
stayed accessible in production when we

00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:03,350
went over to Amazon site last year for

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,870
example it would allow users to keyboard

00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:08,720
navigate to a video although that was

00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:11,949
pretty difficult and when you press play

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,930
on that video it would pop up as a modal

00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:17,589
those boxes that appear on a web page

00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:20,420
and block the content behind them and

00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:23,420
they didn't pass focus to that modal

00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:26,540
that means the user is still on the page

00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:29,230
behind the video going through the

00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:31,340
content they're about purchasing it or

00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:33,260
terms and service

00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:37,160
and not actually getting to the video

00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:39,440
controls the only way to stop it was

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:44,720
either refreshing the page or navigating

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:48,440
away in fact even today and well this is

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,300
actually just yesterday they've avoided

00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,210
implementing common and easy

00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:55,339
accessibility wins you can't close their

00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:58,490
video related models such as an error

00:13:55,339 --> 00:14:00,980
message easily with the keyboard and

00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:04,730
such as with an escape key which is a

00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:06,740
common feature and it's like someone had

00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:09,050
got a ticket telling them to make it

00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,360
possible to play a video by keyboard

00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:16,130
navigation and no one had actually

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:20,180
considered anything beyond that and the

00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:23,300
thing is if helping your users isn't

00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:25,700
enough good accessibility isn't even

00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:28,880
just for them though according to most

00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:31,520
surveys 15 to 20 percent of many

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:35,960
countries are disabled so that's a ton

00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:39,050
of users but good code and is good code

00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:44,180
and accessibility makes you write markup

00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:47,330
that is good web crawlers for example

00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:49,610
such as the Google search benefit not

00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:52,490
only for all those SEO tags that you're

00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:55,550
shoving into your web site but also from

00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:57,800
well-structured content and as devices

00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:00,380
such as Alexa and Ecco become more

00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,330
popular having web sites that can work

00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:04,580
for programs that can't access

00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:08,210
information the way your average user

00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:10,610
would is going to be very important

00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:13,040
after all they're not going to play your

00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,690
video or listen to your audio they

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,440
aren't going to notice objects that are

00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:19,940
hidden or require interaction and you'll

00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,240
even notice that a lot of accessibility

00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:27,380
checkers are web crawlers so that can

00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:29,480
give you an idea of what they use it

00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:32,750
also makes it easier for new developers

00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:35,870
to work with the code your headers make

00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:38,540
sense your nav and sidebars and new

00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,709
content are clearly labeled you know

00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,470
that's something that's a button

00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:43,590
performs

00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:47,310
action and we're a link goes you're

00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:49,800
making less work for others there are

00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:52,470
also legal repercussions for had

00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,050
accessibility in the last few years

00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:56,820
there's been well publicized cases of

00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,820
sites being sued for a lack of

00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:01,710
accessibility for example the University

00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:04,110
of Berkeley got in trouble for EDX

00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:06,750
videos that were notoriously and

00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:09,540
accessible lucking closed captioning and

00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:13,260
transcripts having nothing to describe

00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:14,910
any of the figures or graphs and you may

00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:18,210
have heard recently of the winn-dixie

00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:20,520
case in June when someone using jaws

00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:23,220
found their site and accessible and

00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:26,070
kicked off the first full trial by a

00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:30,390
federal court in the US on issues of web

00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:32,550
accessibility in the US government

00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:34,770
entities and those receiving money from

00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:37,350
them as well as sources of Education

00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:39,630
must follow certain guidelines from the

00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:43,080
Americans with Disability Act or section

00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:46,430
508 or 504 with only a few exceptions

00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:49,470
for things like nuclear warheads

00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:51,180
businesses like when Dixie fall under

00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:53,700
the ad a because of the public

00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:57,050
accommodations section even in cases of

00:16:53,700 --> 00:17:00,450
third-party applications on their site

00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:03,540
so if you have to ask who is the

00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:07,020
accessibility for no that's for

00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:10,190
basically everyone users web crawlers

00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:15,660
developers your company's lawyers

00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:18,420
everyone but what is good accessibility

00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:21,690
and what are some easy wins that you can

00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:24,810
pull off on your site color and thighs

00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:27,300
are a great starting point there are

00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:29,310
many tools to check contrast between a

00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,320
foreground and background color on your

00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:33,060
website and many will tell you whether

00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,550
they meet certain standards for

00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:38,640
accessibility the size and weight of

00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:42,660
your text also matters the bigger the

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:45,090
better the bolder of the better having

00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,840
alternative text on your images is very

00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:48,480
important

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,670
putting alt tags into the image markup

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,500
or other alternatives help people know

00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:56,190
what's in that space even if

00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:59,010
they can't see it also don't include the

00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:01,890
word image in that alt text screen

00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:04,380
readers know it's an image will inform

00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:08,040
users that it's an image and hearing

00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:11,840
image image of blah blah over and over

00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,840
again is not a good user experience

00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:18,600
never rely on just one way to inform

00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:20,970
someone of an error or alert if you just

00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,650
use changing colors people who can't

00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:26,430
tell the difference will miss it

00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:29,130
so clears and symbols work well a mix of

00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:32,580
words and symbols for an error is even

00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:34,740
better because symbols don't always mean

00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:38,880
what you think they mean to all of your

00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:42,120
users but also know that you'll have to

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,920
update the Aria attributes for that Aria

00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,290
are attributes you can add into the

00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:49,620
markup for screen readers to communicate

00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:51,690
with it putting an aria role of alert

00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:54,000
will let screen readers know that

00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,280
something that might change and would

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,220
need to actually interrupt the browsing

00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:01,380
of the user there are other similar

00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:04,130
areas where Aria tags are very important

00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:06,450
and familiarizing with your thumb

00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:08,670
familiarizing yourself with them is a

00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,940
good way to find some easy wins for your

00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:12,840
website if you're not already using them

00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,840
especially when you're working with

00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:18,900
forums where you can match labels with

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:22,580
form fields give longer descriptions and

00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:27,390
a whole lot of other very nice magic

00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:30,300
have also make sure to have feedback on

00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:32,910
other things in many ways as possible

00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:35,340
don't just have visual or audio or

00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:38,040
haptic cues that convey information if

00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:43,500
that's what you're using try to have all

00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:46,170
three for example and try that again in

00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,420
your site with a keyboard not many

00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:52,080
people I know actually end up doing this

00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:53,490
and it can be very revealing you may

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,860
have to change some settings on your

00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:59,100
computer and you may have to learn a few

00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:01,620
keyboard commands but it can be very

00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:05,940
helpful for learning with stress points

00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:08,520
for users and while you're doing that

00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,160
that screenreaders berry they have

00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,510
different ways of conveying information

00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,880
and you have to try a few different ones

00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:17,340
and check on multiple browsers while

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,130
doing that and realize that people that

00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,870
regularly use screen readers are not the

00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:25,440
same as someone that's just using them

00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:27,270
to test them every so often it's like

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:32,040
the equivalent of you playing plaid

00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:35,160
football while they're in the NFL but

00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:37,740
for some people it's easier to consider

00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,140
what could go wrong and take it from

00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:44,430
there

00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:46,500
so styling very important don't just do

00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:48,810
something because it looks cool without

00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:51,630
considering how different users would

00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:55,220
perceive it something is not good design

00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:57,480
if it's causing issues for your user

00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:00,600
infinite scroll is something that

00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,760
designers seem to love but putting

00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,800
content somewhere might need to axe

00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,960
someone might need to access in the

00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,960
mark-up after the section with infinite

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:13,230
scroll such as a right-handed sidebar or

00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:15,120
footer can make it impossible for

00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,810
someone using a keyboard or other

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,210
alternative input devices to access it

00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:24,210
lazy loading too can be bad for

00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:27,150
accessibility a screen reader user could

00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:30,540
be interrupted every time something new

00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:32,900
appears or they could be alerted at or

00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:36,870
they could not be alerted at all and

00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:38,760
completely miss some of your content so

00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:42,780
try to push back a little bit on those

00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:45,930
in and in the last year or so I've

00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:49,260
noticed a lot of squiggly lines being

00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:51,300
favored in web design and sometimes

00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:54,960
they'll run across websites where their

00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:57,180
underlines are on even wavy lines those

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,760
can make people lose concentration and

00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:01,920
cause certain visual issues such as

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,200
their brain making them think the line

00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,860
is moving and causing headaches or

00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,210
nausea

00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:13,860
in my case particularly and worse I've

00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:16,200
seen lions like that but do you move on

00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:18,960
a few blog sites and others i have seen

00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:22,320
sig zag line animation all

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,690
/ I don't have a tension issue attention

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:28,230
issues and I find constantly moving

00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:30,330
lines to be hugely distracting imagine

00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:37,409
what that would be like for someone with

00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:39,570
issues autoplay also very popular which

00:22:37,409 --> 00:22:42,710
is a bad idea for lots of reasons

00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:45,840
of course but also because it is rarely

00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:47,460
accessible it can interrupt screen

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,549
readers making it harder for people

00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:53,760
dependent on them to use them it's also

00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:56,399
often an unwelcome surprise which is bad

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,590
for people with anxiety disorders and a

00:22:56,399 --> 00:23:01,470
distraction which is bad for people with

00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:04,380
attention disorders if a person's audio

00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:07,710
is set to a high volume or the video has

00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:10,799
flashing or fast movements it could also

00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:14,520
cause migraines panic attacks and

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:16,559
possibly even seizures that's one of the

00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:19,620
reasons of readings but people use ad

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:22,620
blockers though often prevent video and

00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:25,649
audio from auto-playing but because so

00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:28,950
many sites get revenue from ads people

00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:33,360
are pushing for blocking them oftentimes

00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:35,340
this involves a modal that pops up and

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:39,149
tells the person to whitelist the fight

00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:42,090
and sometimes the modal's not accessible

00:23:39,149 --> 00:23:45,149
making it even more of an annoyance for

00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:48,230
people with accessibility needs so what

00:23:45,149 --> 00:23:50,909
ad blockers may be bad for business

00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:55,770
trying to block those means you're

00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:58,950
actively losing business anyway and I

00:23:55,770 --> 00:24:01,500
get it with the modal's right I did the

00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:04,620
modal's for our website and they can be

00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:08,990
hard but making them accessible is not

00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:12,570
impossible just spend a little more time

00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:15,210
along with that animated images are also

00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:18,480
popular and also come with the load of

00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:20,820
issues for example making people click

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,279
on ant animated objects to get further

00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:26,429
into the page or go to a specific link

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:29,100
because it's fun or having texts move

00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:30,480
around can be bad for people with

00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,020
various disabilities

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,060
there's even

00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:37,030
you made your websites that like to use

00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:43,060
random gifts as the entire background

00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:45,460
for a page I still have flashbacks to

00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:48,930
the horror that was Tumblr's log in the

00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:53,560
screen if you messed up the first time

00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:56,680
the gifts were fast moving and brightly

00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:59,620
colored and you would keep going and

00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:01,600
going until you really typed in your log

00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:03,790
in which you had a higher chance of

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,790
messing up because you're in a rush and

00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:09,520
the screen would come back with the same

00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:13,180
information and a different horrible

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:15,220
gift each time they've toned that down a

00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:18,160
little but some of their backgrounds are

00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:20,800
still gifts and are still badly chosen

00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:23,650
gifts at that one recently is just like

00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:26,800
multi-coloured balls bouncing and piped

00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:30,160
and moving way too fast and too

00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:33,430
distracting Lee for the screen you may

00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:36,700
have heard the term user hostile for the

00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:39,610
opposite of user friendly and that's

00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:43,930
what this is created a user hostile

00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:48,010
environment which brings us to a very

00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:52,210
serious question is your styling causing

00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:53,920
harm if you're able-bodied and there are

00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:56,740
parts of your website that give you

00:25:53,920 --> 00:26:00,070
issues you can be a guaranteed they're

00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:02,500
worse for disabled users beyond that

00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:05,890
consider the web standards consider what

00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:08,110
you see users complain about and what

00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:10,030
might cause difficulties for people who

00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:13,720
aren't using the site the way you are

00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:15,160
and if you're not capable of that that's

00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,790
the point where you have to bring in

00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:21,280
some experts you can hire consultants to

00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:23,800
audit your site there are plenty of

00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:26,800
those these days but even if you're not

00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:28,510
hiring accessibility consultants you

00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,580
could offer to hire users with

00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:33,280
disabilities as the web equivalent of

00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:34,990
sensitivity readers just to go through

00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:38,440
your site and tell you where they run

00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:41,410
into problems after all if you have a UX

00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,870
team you're probably paying for basic

00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:44,870
testing anyway people are willing to sit

00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:46,820
in cafes

00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:49,910
handing out gift cards just have people

00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:51,980
go through a few wireframes you could do

00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:55,840
similar for usability for disabled

00:26:51,980 --> 00:27:00,110
people too because sometimes the experts

00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:03,140
actually get things wrong right Blake

00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:05,510
with the new handicap symbol they take a

00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:08,200
symbol that represents many and they

00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:11,390
update it with the best of intentions

00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:14,090
but end up causing controversy because

00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:16,520
many see it as an ableist choice

00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:18,980
the original handicap symbol could be

00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:22,370
many types of wheelchairs the new one

00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:24,380
can only be a manual one which serves to

00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:27,200
further isolate many of the people who

00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:29,300
can't perform such actions and this

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,610
could have been avoided if they'd just

00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:34,160
consulted some of the disabled people

00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:38,290
who focus on disability issues in their

00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:41,840
community and while you're at it

00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:44,990
remember that all of your content is

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:47,870
important it's not just about images and

00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:51,020
markup your written content can harm

00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:53,210
your users as well I went to a site

00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:56,660
recently looking for economic keyboards

00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:59,210
I'm reading the content it's looking

00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:01,940
fine and then I get to a point where

00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:03,260
it's talking about usage and it says no

00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:08,929
stain application

00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:12,620
no theme application we all know what

00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:15,440
they need what they probably just held

00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:18,050
off from saying and everyone reading

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,690
that with a mental health issue or who

00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:22,460
cares about them knows the person

00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:27,590
writing it didn't care if they were

00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:33,160
being insulting no well-made application

00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:37,280
no logical application no good

00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:40,160
application on a professional site you

00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:43,100
should not be insulting your users you

00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:46,790
should not be hurting your users in any

00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:49,670
way because you're going to lose some of

00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:52,280
those users the people who don't care

00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:57,730
won't even notice if the words are there

00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:57,730
or not but the people who do care will

00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:05,360
because what is accessible for some does

00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:06,890
not equal accessibility for all some

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,400
people don't care what you call another

00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:13,130
group some people do if you do have an

00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:16,040
accessibility need and go well I'm not

00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:19,970
upset by X that doesn't mean other

00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:23,570
people aren't and the same for anything

00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:26,120
for your styling bold colors with high

00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:28,520
contrasts are great for users with

00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:30,800
vision issues but if they're bright or

00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:33,280
if there are too many they could be bad

00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,900
for users with attention issues

00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:38,840
infographics are great free people with

00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:40,760
attention issues or reading issues but

00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:46,460
are very hard on someone with vision

00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:49,910
issues we have so much control over how

00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:53,600
our websites look and feel and their

00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:58,970
content these days and there's no reason

00:29:53,600 --> 00:30:01,550
to leave anyone behind with it and if

00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:04,700
you're advocating for accessibility but

00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:06,650
no one at work cares sometimes that

00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:09,560
means you do have to find a middle

00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:12,500
ground you might have people saying that

00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:14,660
styling doesn't fit for example you

00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,910
might have stakeholders and since that

00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:20,150
page has something or doesn't have

00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:22,130
something or designers who have very

00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:25,400
inaccessible designs they don't want to

00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:27,350
change or developers who say that making

00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:30,740
something accessible will take too long

00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:32,630
or it's too hard so you might not have

00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:36,050
be able to have perfect accessibility

00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:39,410
but you can push for more you can make

00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:41,680
things as accessible as possible because

00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:46,550
that's better than nothing which is

00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:50,240
sadly what a lot of sites have here's

00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:52,490
one really easy when focus day is an

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,710
outline that appears around an element

00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:57,620
on the page indicating that's where

00:30:54,710 --> 00:31:00,980
someone's navigation is placed it allows

00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:02,960
someone who say is sighted but relying

00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:05,390
on their keyboard for navigation instead

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,300
of a mouse to know where the equivalent

00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:11,049
of their mouse pointer is it normally

00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:14,019
appears as a gray or blue outline

00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:18,340
depending on the browser and styling it

00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:22,980
is also very easy to remove it's just

00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:27,789
one line of CSS and some designers

00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:30,190
really like removing it but Pratt well

00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:32,860
browsers have defaults for a reason

00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:36,249
because people are used to them and they

00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:39,070
generally work if you need to change the

00:31:36,249 --> 00:31:42,039
colors or the look slightly just to keep

00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:47,139
it that's still better than not having

00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:49,359
it so in the end while your

00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:51,940
accessibility will probably not be

00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:55,869
perfect and even if you try very very

00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:59,679
hard you'll probably miss something at

00:31:55,869 --> 00:32:03,190
least you will have something be ready

00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:05,769
for mistakes and mishaps be gracious if

00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:08,350
it's pointed out and don't be

00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:11,830
discouraged everyone goes through this

00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:13,929
and don't and definitely don't think but

00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:17,200
just because it won't be great

00:32:13,929 --> 00:32:20,619
accessibility you shouldn't bother and

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:26,440
now the weather or a real life related

00:32:20,619 --> 00:32:29,470
example at work we switched from an icon

00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:31,659
font to SVG's for icons as you may know

00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:35,049
I don't know SVG's are considered very

00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:39,309
accessible this we thought was an easy

00:32:35,049 --> 00:32:40,929
win but one of the reasons they're

00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:43,450
accessible is that you can put

00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:47,169
accessibility information inside the

00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:50,169
actual SVG and work on the image as code

00:32:47,169 --> 00:32:52,629
they can have titles description and

00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:55,029
other content right there and you can

00:32:52,629 --> 00:32:57,460
also put the Aria labels that point to

00:32:55,029 --> 00:33:00,999
them in case the browser doesn't support

00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:04,809
that but that's if you include the SVG

00:33:00,999 --> 00:33:08,289
in your markup and in many cases you

00:33:04,809 --> 00:33:10,239
want both reusable SVG's meaning

00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:13,299
separate files that you can include in

00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:15,460
various pages and SPG's that are placed

00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:16,720
in an image directory to keep things

00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,509
organized

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,909
this makes inlining SVG's including

00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:24,670
their code as is in the code of the

00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:27,610
document a little more difficult

00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:30,250
and if you put an SVG into HTML image

00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:34,600
tags the way you would any other image

00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:36,190
it loses a lot of its accessibility we

00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:39,010
decided to go about solving this by

00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:41,950
making a function that takes the path of

00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:44,770
our SVG icons and inserts them into a

00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:48,310
template from our static directory where

00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:50,950
we kept images in our templates all we

00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:54,160
need to do is use that function to call

00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:58,450
a particular SVG and now I send the HTML

00:33:54,160 --> 00:34:01,390
the page as an actual SVG so we have the

00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:04,120
SVG with its Aria labeled by property

00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:07,290
pointing to the title which also still

00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:09,610
exists so screen readers can access it

00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:12,730
instead of compromising on what we

00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:14,350
wanted or on what we could do we took a

00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:16,960
little extra time to think about the

00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:21,010
problem and the steps necessary to

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:24,250
resolve it I said we'd only do a little

00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:26,919
bit of code and there it is but if

00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:27,850
anyone wants to discuss details about

00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:29,890
accessibility

00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:34,750
feel free to catch me hanging your out

00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:39,580
around the comp I'll be practically

00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:41,470
anywhere before we wrap up I also want

00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:43,990
to go through a few great tools for

00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:44,380
testing accessibility quickly on your

00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:47,440
own

00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:50,290
you can find these and others linked in

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:54,040
my website the URL will be on the next

00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:56,890
slide the chrome accessibility developer

00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:59,200
tool is a browser extension that you can

00:34:56,890 --> 00:35:01,330
use web chrome dev tools and it gives

00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,910
you accessibility errors and warnings as

00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:08,110
well as tells you stuff like the color

00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:10,660
contrast rates under a wicked 2.0 no

00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:13,480
coffee is another great extension for

00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:15,070
Chrome it allows you to experience the

00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:18,100
way people with different visual

00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:20,590
impairments see a web page which can be

00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:23,140
anything from cloudy vision to color

00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:26,980
blindness to things like floaters that

00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:30,400
can interrupt their view a checker is a

00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:32,950
website you can give a URL or copy and

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:36,130
paste code into to have it check your

00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:37,540
accessibility the way of evaluation tool

00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:40,510
is a

00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:42,730
tension for grounded I think other

00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:47,140
browsers that will do that in browser

00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:50,470
and finally jaws screen reader is being

00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:54,610
still the most popular screen reader in

00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:56,590
use it's for Windows and you can

00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:59,560
download a free version of it for

00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:01,990
testing it only runs for a certain

00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:04,720
amount of time before you technically

00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:06,760
have to restart your computer so if you

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,590
can get a Windows virtual environment

00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:13,810
running all you have to do is just

00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:15,840
restart that over and over again it's a

00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:18,450
prototype

00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:21,670
finally here's my contact information

00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:24,160
you can find the link to resources and

00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:28,750
slides from my website which is dragon

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:31,600
with the u dot tech and the non stock

00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:33,730
image sources or after this in the slide

00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:36,430
deck for anyone who for some reason

00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:39,580
wanted those and if you have any

00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:43,600
questions for me I'll be in the hallway
