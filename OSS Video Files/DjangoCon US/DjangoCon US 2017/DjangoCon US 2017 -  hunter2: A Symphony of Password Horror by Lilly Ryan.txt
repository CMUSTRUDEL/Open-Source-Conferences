	DjangoCon US 2017 -  hunter2: A Symphony of Password Horror by Lilly Ryan

The year is 2017. We have hoverboards, jetpacks, solar-powered cars, and also so many awful passwords that it’s become trivial for pretty much anyone to have their accounts compromised. We’ve got passwords for our passwords. Eight-year-olds with a dictionary and a set of dice can generate mathematically stronger passwords than most corporations that have your credit card details. We spend our days wandering through endless forests of requirements to come up with something that contains no more than twelve letters, a special character, the eye of a newt, and at least one uppercase letter, only to be emailed it back in plaintext if you forget it. And then it goes on a Post-It note on a monitor.

Do not despair - this talk is here to help!

From beginners to experts, all technical folk have the power to build a post-password future. Lilly, an engineer and historian, will guide you through the history of how we got ourselves into this state, and explain why major companies still think that the best way to keep your stuff secure is to poke their heads out of the tree-house and ask you for the secret word. She will then hand you strong technical tools to help your clients and colleagues understand why there are better things out there than “Welcome1!”, and help you work together to bring a small ray of sunshine into our password-saturated world.

[Music]

00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,440
um feel free to wave out if it's if the

00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,860
audio quality is not great

00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,910
um okay thank you very much for coming

00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,860
along I'm Lily

00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:29,180
what I'm about to share with you is a

00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:30,650
horror story about passwords also what

00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,750
about the bananas they have nothing to

00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:35,420
do with this talk I'm using them as

00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:45,020
slide clickers which I'm hoping will

00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:47,899
work oh no these don't oh my gosh hang

00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,570
on I think we have a loose banana no

00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:52,730
loose bananas

00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:58,059
there's no good oh well we'll see how we

00:00:52,730 --> 00:01:01,550
go um anyway oh I know what I'm working

00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:04,519
now they're working okay cool

00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:07,670
all right problem solved if an on as a

00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,500
functional all right mmm so this is uh

00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,940
this is my Twitter handle

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,450
in case you want to be friends on the

00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:16,850
Internet um all right and as I said this

00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,650
is a horror story about passwords and

00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:21,140
drawing on good horror stories I'm gonna

00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:22,100
use images here from the 1922 movie

00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,439
Nosferatu

00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:28,670
which was the first vampire movie ever

00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:32,119
made and I'm using these because firstly

00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:34,130
like vampires the story of passwords is

00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:37,640
life draining and keeps me awake at

00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:39,259
night in terror and secondly because

00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,130
most password policies are about as well

00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:42,130
written as Twilight

00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:53,830
I'm gonna be mentioning a few Django

00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:55,450
specific packages in this talk and a lot

00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,229
of other blog posts and news articles

00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,560
and things like that

00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:01,300
so to save you taking pictures of

00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,100
anything that you want to look up later

00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,540
while I'm talking I've collected all of

00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,040
my research and everything that I've

00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,530
mentioned in this talk that I'm going to

00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,300
mention and I put it in at this link on

00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:12,520
my website and I'll share this link

00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:18,820
again at the end of the talk so don't

00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:21,310
panic okay if you follow tech news in

00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,200
any capacity you hear every day about

00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,239
databases of username and password

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,970
combinations being dumped out on the

00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:29,680
public internet and these reports

00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,020
usually come with a heavy use of the

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,540
word cyber and maybe a picture of

00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,190
someone in a hoodie or screen with lots

00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,570
of zeros and ones and maybe the word

00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:41,050
password in the middle of it somewhere

00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:43,030
because this cybers are very scary and

00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,959
if you've been using the internet for a

00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:48,130
while you know that

00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:50,110
passwords kind of suck and if you've

00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:54,070
been working in software for a while you

00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:55,450
know the passwords really suck we all

00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:58,660
kind of take the presence of passwords

00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:01,630
for granted you get a an email account

00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,860
that's a password you get hired for a

00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,750
new job and you need to get into your

00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,730
work account that's another password you

00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,380
sign up for Netflix and that's yet

00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,940
another password and probably a shared

00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,320
password because you'll share that

00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,570
account with everyone in your household

00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,610
and you might put that on the fridge

00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:20,590
next to the Wi-Fi password which you

00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:22,510
also hopefully have we all know that the

00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,600
most common passwords are still password

00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,769
and one two three four five six and we

00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,360
know that most people use the same

00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:31,540
password for multiple accounts because

00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,820
it's easier to remember that way and we

00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,820
know that a lot that a nonzero number of

00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:38,739
people put their password on a post-it

00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:43,239
note on their monitor so that they can

00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:46,840
remember it and despite all of the

00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:50,760
interesting and glamorous new software

00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,760
hacks that make the news

00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,810
password database leaks is still the

00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,650
most common way to quote unquote

00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:00,840
get hacked restrictive password policies

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,060
mean that people make poor password

00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,000
choices and they've repeat their

00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,800
passwords the choices we make with how

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,810
we store these passwords as software

00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,480
developers contributes to a lot of this

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,340
information being leaked online and the

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,900
fact that many services still have

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,150
passwords as their only form of

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:23,040
authentication contributes to passwords

00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:25,230
being a single point of failure but

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,930
despite being pretty basic in some ways

00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:29,640
all of these things are really important

00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:32,850
and how we got ourselves into this

00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,170
password mess is important and I want to

00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:38,250
tell you about how we got to this point

00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:39,960
for two reasons firstly in addition to

00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,690
being a person who does things with code

00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,880
I am also a historian which is a story

00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:48,000
for another time and I'm interested in

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,800
why we got to where we are and more

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,030
importantly why we still keep doing this

00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,650
to ourselves and the second and probably

00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:58,230
more urgent reason to tell you about

00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:01,220
passwords is because I'm bored of

00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:03,720
hearing about them all the time

00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:06,060
passwords are pretty bad technology with

00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,950
several different bad implementations

00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,080
and I would rather be doing something

00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,670
more exciting with my time than running

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,210
around cleaning up the mess left by

00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:17,580
passwords and the reason I thought I

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,830
want to tell you folks about this is

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,410
because we're the ones who can really do

00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:24,630
something about it we are your IT folk

00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:26,700
and your testers and your system

00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:28,680
administrators sometimes we're

00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,390
consultants sometimes we'll work in the

00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,800
house and sometimes we're the ones who

00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:34,050
get called up by our families to help

00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,840
them install antivirus and backup their

00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,940
photographs we are the ones who have the

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,340
influence and the ability to do

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,890
something about this so if you're as

00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,990
tired as I am of hearing about passwords

00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:50,190
being leaked and accounts being hacked

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:52,340
I really implore you to join me and help

00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:56,940
fix this for everybody

00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:59,130
so here is a horrible story of awful

00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,080
passwords followed by a list of five

00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,570
ways that we can stop doing this to

00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:15,900
ourselves over and over and over again

00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:19,710
because we deserve nice things okay once

00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,420
upon a time there was a password and his

00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,670
password was Open Sesame

00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,960
and it protected a cave where a bunch of

00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,830
thieves were hiding the treasures that

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,600
they'd stolen

00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:33,150
there was no two-factor authentication

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:35,100
on this case one day a guy called

00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,020
Alibaba was in the neighborhood and he

00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,330
saw the thieves saying

00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:42,030
Open Sesame and getting into the magic

00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:43,560
cave so he exploited this by waiting

00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:45,660
until they had left walking up to the

00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,940
cave and saying Open Sesame

00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,310
and he got in and he had a look around

00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:52,320
and he took a bag of coins that the

00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:56,190
thieves had stolen and he left the cave

00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:58,410
and he bought a cool new house the

00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:01,290
thieves came after him to kill him and

00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:03,270
to get back what he'd stolen and after a

00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:05,280
protracted and dramatic series of events

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,290
Alibaba managed to kill all of the

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,730
thieves until he was the only one who

00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:10,650
knew the password to this magic cave

00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:13,800
which is really how the first thief

00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:15,960
should have kept it at the start so that

00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,110
story which normally goes by the name of

00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,240
Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves is

00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,920
allegedly thousands of years old it is

00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:27,660
at least 300 years old which is still

00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:29,700
pretty old here's another one that's

00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:33,180
less old than that but still slightly

00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:35,490
older than the Internet once upon a time

00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:39,230
in about the coldest part of the Cold

00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:41,790
War there was a president of an America

00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:43,170
this president decided that the United

00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:46,320
States stockpile of nuclear weapons

00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:48,060
probably needed some kind of controls so

00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,490
that they didn't get set off by accident

00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:54,840
or by just anyone because that would

00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:56,730
probably be bad so the president asked

00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,120
his Secretary of Defense to make that

00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,190
happen

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,690
and the Secretary of Defense made it

00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,610
mandatory for there to be a passcode

00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,830
lock on the big red button that could

00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,480
make the world explode so that it would

00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,860
have to be

00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,780
catered to people and entered

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,220
deliberately before they were really

00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:19,610
sure that they wanted all of the fallout

00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:21,500
from that decision the guy who was in

00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:24,310
charge of Strategic Air commands thought

00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,300
that this was a ridiculous system

00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:29,720
because it got in the way of making it

00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:32,240
easy to push the big red button and also

00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:35,540
because pass pass codes are annoying to

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,250
remember so he changed all the pass

00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:41,110
codes on all of the copies of the big

00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,110
red button to a string of eight zeros

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,290
and this is why I'm pretty sure that

00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,720
we're all living in some kind of

00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:50,180
alternate splinter universe because by

00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,910
some miracle we didn't all die and

00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:55,370
because the world survived to make more

00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:59,180
bad password decisions here's one more

00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:01,220
story for you once upon a time there was

00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:07,190
a guy called Alan who is a PhD student

00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:09,290
at MIT MIT had a computer and much like

00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:11,660
my childhood there was only one of them

00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:13,880
and it was in very high demand because

00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,410
everybody wanted to use it presumably a

00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:19,550
lot like my childhood because they all

00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:22,310
wanted to play roller coaster tycoon so

00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:24,830
MIT decided what most parents decide

00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:26,690
which is the sharing is nice and so they

00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:29,540
divided up computer time among the MIT

00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:31,670
researchers into several hour blocks and

00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:34,070
to stop people taking over other

00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:36,920
people's blocks of time they put a time

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,510
lock system on the computer which meant

00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,130
that at the end of your allocated time

00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:44,360
you would be logged out and then the

00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:46,250
next person could come and log in Alan

00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,290
had been given four hours a week on this

00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,390
computer which was actually pretty good

00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,830
for that point in time but not good

00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:54,830
enough for the research that Alan was

00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:56,540
doing in Alan's opinion so he had a look

00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:59,210
around on the computer and he discovered

00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,640
the file that kept all two usernames and

00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:03,700
passwords in it this file was called

00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,800
passwords

00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,600
and it was in plain text because this

00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,910
was the first time that anybody had ever

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,770
thought to put passwords on a computer

00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:15,100
and they clearly hadn't heard the story

00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:18,280
of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves so

00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,750
Allen printed out this file and then

00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,340
whenever he'd run out of his for hours

00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,920
he would just log out and he could log

00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:25,660
in as somebody else and he also dumped

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,000
this data for all of the other PhD

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,950
students at MIT to use because he was

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,060
nice and also because if everyone was

00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:35,350
doing it it would be harder to pinpoint

00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:40,570
it on him Allen got away with it and

00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:42,760
people still get away with it the

00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:44,920
ancient Greek warfare strategist Aeneas

00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:48,910
tactics once said that a good password

00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:50,980
should be easy to remember the login

00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,840
system for my bank once said that any

00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,600
good password should be between 8 and 16

00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,730
characters and contain at least at least

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,550
one uppercase in one lowercase letter a

00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:01,690
number and one special character as long

00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:04,150
as that special character is something

00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:05,920
like at or dollar sign and not something

00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:08,750
weird like a tilde or something that'll

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,230
break that database like a semicolon

00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:15,199
and passwords which use characters or

00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:18,709
fancy accented parts or characters with

00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:22,069
fancy omelets or accented parts or god

00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:26,660
forbid emoji are very bad passwords who

00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:27,949
will be sent to bed without dessert or

00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,980
the ability to pay your bills

00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:38,089
I used the past-tense there because when

00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:39,439
I read this I switched banks the point

00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:41,120
in telling you all of these stories is

00:11:39,439 --> 00:11:43,399
that we never really got to this point

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,250
with regard to passwords we have always

00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:48,050
been exactly where we are we've just

00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,819
made passwords more and more mandatory

00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,680
to get anything done when they were

00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:54,920
already kind of a giant pain in the butt

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,379
but security is also something that most

00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,860
people don't think about at all

00:11:56,379 --> 00:12:03,649
and we all lived horribly ever after the

00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:07,279
end because this this whole situation is

00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:09,009
kind of awful most of the time but we

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,050
know that we can do better

00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:13,850
we enable multi-factor authentication on

00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,439
all of our accounts and we use a

00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,839
password manager and we generate long

00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:19,490
passwords and we know that really the

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,620
length of the password combined with

00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:24,529
unpredictability like a bunch of random

00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,990
words makes that password harder to

00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:30,529
crack rather than a short non dictionary

00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:33,350
word with special characters but not

00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:35,540
everybody knows that and it's everybody

00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,220
else who builds and uses the Internet

00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:39,620
the majority of the time not just the

00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,089
people in this room so if we want to get

00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,759
it right for us we have to make it right

00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:46,009
for them too so here are some

00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:48,079
recommendations for five simple things

00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:52,540
that we can do as technical people to

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,540
make this ever so slightly better

00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:06,090
all right hmm firstly salt and hash any

00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:08,700
passwords that your system stores I know

00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:11,490
that this particular point is brought up

00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,600
in most talks about passwords but the

00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:15,030
reason I'm bringing it up again is

00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,420
because a scary number of websites and

00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:20,070
services still don't do this if you're

00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:24,210
working on a system that doesn't do this

00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:26,010
please make it do this and for those who

00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:29,540
are unsure how to do this here's a quick

00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:31,740
overview here is an average password

00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,930
someone uses this password for an

00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,000
account on your system so your system

00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,560
needs to remember it however we don't

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,020
want to store this in plain text because

00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,120
if we do that then the PhD students of

00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,770
the PhD student Alan's of the world will

00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:49,470
do what if they've been doing since the

00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:51,120
1960s so we need to add some salt salt

00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,620
in this case means a random string that

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,820
you append to a password before you

00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,370
store it in your system which should

00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,350
ideally be a little bit long and it

00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,300
should also be unique meaning that you

00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:03,150
don't use the same salt on all the

00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,920
passwords in your system and maybe keep

00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:08,160
it to yourself don't publish this

00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:10,230
anywhere particularly important then

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,460
before you store it you run the password

00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,050
and the salt together through a hashing

00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:15,030
algorithm get the output of that

00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,980
algorithm maybe run it again a few times

00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,970
get the output of that and then store

00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,150
that in your database

00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:24,270
this example uses sha-256 with only one

00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:25,920
round of hashing I know that people have

00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:28,020
lots of opinions about which hashing

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,360
algorithms are the best but there are

00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:32,490
two overall don'ts regardless of which

00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,470
one that you use firstly please don't

00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:37,490
try to write your own hashing algorithm

00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,720
there are plenty out there that are very

00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,810
good and we're written by people with

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,420
mathematics PhDs

00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:46,670
secondly please don't use sha-1 as your

00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:48,320
hashing algorithm because even though it

00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,930
was developed by people with mathematics

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,440
PhDs it's a pretty old algorithm and

00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:56,450
insecure by today's standards so if you

00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,790
have salt all the passwords that you're

00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:00,950
storing even if your password database

00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:03,110
gets leaked it would be really difficult

00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:04,640
for an attacker to reverse that password

00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,380
because they won't be able to guess the

00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,940
password just from its hash by itself

00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,740
and they will also have to guess the

00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,200
salt that you used for each password and

00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,990
how many times you went around which

00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:18,410
makes the task approximately infinity

00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:19,880
times more difficult and look I mean at

00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,350
the very very least please don't let

00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:27,290
your client store their passwords in

00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:28,910
plain text the good news is that if

00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:30,650
you're wondering how to do this and you

00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:35,600
use Jango which I suspect some of you

00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:36,710
might Jango does this by default instead

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,320
of having to bring all of this together

00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,010
manually which is also usually not the

00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:44,480
best idea

00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:46,940
Jango uses pbkdf2 to take care of all

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,210
the hashing and the salting and it will

00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:52,280
do this multiple times for you

00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:53,660
pbkdf2 is slow to compute but you want

00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,850
this because it also means that it takes

00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,620
a really it it takes infinity times

00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:59,930
longer than that for someone else to run

00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,360
all of the possible permutations of the

00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:04,460
salts and the hashes and the rounds so

00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,170
even if your database is leaked your

00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,270
users should still be reasonably well

00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:10,490
protected and if you don't want to use

00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:13,070
the Jango default you can also use argon

00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:16,640
too or bcrypt by changing the password

00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:18,950
hashes setting and in my resources I've

00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,240
honestly literally just added a link to

00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,640
the Docs because the Doc's are really

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,450
good and if I explain more I would just

00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,890
be reading them to you let's not do that

00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,960
another thing that you can do on a

00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:30,460
django project to help with passwords is

00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,290
to implement a lockout on the number of

00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:34,030
password attempts that people have when

00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,890
they're trying to log in so if someone

00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:37,450
does try to log in maliciously they only

00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:40,060
have it they won't get to try very many

00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:43,270
times and they won't get to hammer your

00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:45,640
service with failed requests django

00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:47,020
access has you covered there according

00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,180
to their Doc's they're called access

00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:53,110
because partly because access sounds

00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:55,270
like access and also because axes are a

00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:58,510
thing that you can use to hack stuff and

00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:59,050
they want to prevent hacking and one

00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:01,390
more thing

00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:03,900
while we're here make sure that your

00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:05,890
service uses HTTPS when you handle login

00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,690
because it's no good to do all of this

00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:09,370
fancy hashing and salting and stuff if

00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,880
the past would get sent to you in

00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:14,620
plaintext

00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:16,360
the first time okay secondly implement

00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:19,260
multi-factor authentication on every

00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:22,350
system that you work on that you can

00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:24,490
passwords alone are not enough anymore

00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:25,480
multi-factor authentication means that

00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,600
we need a password

00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,410
aka something we know and another piece

00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,410
of information

00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:34,350
aka something that we have before we can

00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:36,970
let you into your account

00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:39,730
Universal second factor or u2f is

00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:41,440
probably in my opinion the best second

00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:43,420
factor of implementation that there is

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,820
so if you can implement support for it

00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:47,230
please do it

00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:49,420
u2f for those who haven't had a chance

00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:51,730
to work with it yet requires a physical

00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:53,530
key like a Yubikey that speaks directly

00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:55,810
to your browser and uses public key

00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:57,250
cryptography to uniquely identify you

00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:59,470
when you try to log into your account

00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:03,520
it also requires you to touch the keypad

00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:04,840
on it once much like a banana to prove

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,760
that there's a live human at the other

00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,650
end which means that robots can't just

00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,500
try and run this over and over again you

00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:12,970
actually need that capacitive touch

00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,370
there's also a huge amount of

00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:17,950
ridiculously cool stuff going on going

00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:19,750
on under the hood of that so if you want

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:22,090
to learn more there's a link to the

00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,380
Yubikey white paper in my notes or come

00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:26,730
and find me afterwards because I really

00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:30,850
enjoy talking about Yubikey and okay yes

00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:32,410
it's a physical key I know this is

00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:34,390
annoying but it can be used across a

00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:36,920
bunch of different sites without reusing

00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:38,930
credentials which is a lot unlike

00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,400
those that keyring full of RSA tokens

00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:43,670
that you used to have just pretty cool

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,080
and u2f is also an open-source protocol

00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:47,630
which means that anyone should be able

00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:50,660
to pick it up and support it Google and

00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:52,880
Facebook do this so the fast mail so to

00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:56,540
github sort of Dropbox so do others and

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,310
so could you there are a couple about

00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:00,740
the software token ways to do

00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:02,900
multi-factor authentication but the most

00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:05,630
common is TOTP which is a time-based

00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:07,100
one-time password which generates a

00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:09,590
one-time password if you could believe

00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,960
that it's usually six digits long and

00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:14,690
it's based on a shared secret key and

00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,550
the current time and these temporary

00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:18,920
passwords usually don't live for very

00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:20,300
long between about thirty seconds and

00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,820
five minutes depending on your config

00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:25,160
you can deliver this token to a user in

00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,170
a number of ways some people like to

00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,700
write their own apps that will generate

00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,900
the token some people will use

00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,990
third-party apps like Google

00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:34,970
Authenticator and a lot of services send

00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:37,100
these sorts of tokens via SMS but I

00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:38,600
would not recommend doing that because

00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,520
it's trivially easy for a dedicated

00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,040
attack it's a clonal copy of your sim or

00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:45,530
get a hold of that SMS in some other way

00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,750
it's usually not encrypted if they

00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:49,100
really wanted to do that SMS is a second

00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,620
factor delivery method has been

00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,870
deprecated by many people in lots of

00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:57,890
places and in some instances officially

00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:59,750
so avoid SMS if you can but multi-factor

00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:02,480
authentication for Jango is really easy

00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:04,220
which is great

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,020
Markus Holtzman gave a great talk at

00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,170
Jango con Australia last year which

00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:10,370
there is also a link to in my notes

00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:12,830
about how to implement two-factor

00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:15,350
authentication in Jango so instead of

00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,880
repeating that whole talk I've added the

00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:19,580
link and you can go and look that up but

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,740
the TLDR is that the Jango two factor

00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:23,960
auth package contains everything you

00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:26,060
need to implement you 2ft OTP a few

00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,810
other things via Jango out it's really

00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:31,640
cool go and check that out

00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:33,230
okay thirdly make more than one

00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,120
multi-factor authentication method

00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:38,570
available for people who want to use it

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:41,270
you two F and the one-time password plus

00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:43,610
a password itself make things even

00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:46,070
harder for your account to be broken

00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:48,419
into by somebody else not all services

00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:50,639
support multiple second factors

00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:52,259
and I can understand how turning that on

00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:52,859
by default for many people would be kind

00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:55,320
of annoying

00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:56,879
but on the other hand I'm the kind of

00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,049
systems administrator who would really

00:20:56,879 --> 00:21:00,109
like this kind of option to be available

00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:02,879
for super users like me

00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:04,200
there have been heaps of headlines over

00:21:02,879 --> 00:21:05,580
the last few years about how this was

00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,279
that technology is going to be the

00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,869
password killer but honestly I think

00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:12,929
that what's going to kill it is a

00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:14,669
combination of different factors which

00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:16,379
correspond to a thing you know anything

00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:18,299
you have and that's the way it's going

00:21:16,379 --> 00:21:19,739
to be eventually this means that one of

00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:22,049
these things doesn't necessarily need to

00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:23,999
be a traditional password it could be a

00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:27,389
pattern or a sequence or something else

00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:28,859
that you can know and as an aside

00:21:27,389 --> 00:21:29,999
because I don't have time to cover

00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:31,619
absolutely everything about

00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:33,989
authentication and in 30 minutes

00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:36,929
supporting sam'l and ooofff and other

00:21:33,989 --> 00:21:40,320
federated login systems is also a really

00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:43,830
good idea in my notes I've added a link

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:46,499
to Frazer to Adele's PyCon Australia

00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:48,049
talk on federated identity which was

00:21:46,499 --> 00:21:50,519
given this year it's a really good video

00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:52,830
and he goes into all these technologies

00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:57,149
in depth it's from last week it's pretty

00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:59,909
current so go and check that out but

00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:02,220
please remember even if you turn on all

00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:04,739
of the MFA breaking into these accounts

00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:07,519
is still not impossible nothing is ever

00:22:04,739 --> 00:22:10,049
100% secure it's not going to happen

00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:12,059
that said implementing this stuff does

00:22:10,049 --> 00:22:13,590
make it a hell a lot harder for your

00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:18,749
users to have their accounts compromised

00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:21,570
by the average attacker fourthly if

00:22:18,749 --> 00:22:25,019
that's a thing help your clients write

00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:27,389
their password policies good password

00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:28,859
policies will get rid of the special

00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:31,379
character requirements in favor of a

00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:33,749
mandatory minimum password length and a

00:22:31,379 --> 00:22:35,669
randomness checker strictly speaking the

00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:37,769
best passwords are long and hard to

00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:39,059
predict it doesn't matter what kinds of

00:22:37,769 --> 00:22:41,460
special characters and numbers that they

00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:43,919
have in them you usually see mandatory

00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,809
maximum lengths of 16 sometimes 20

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,480
characters but I encourage you if you

00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:50,700
can to ditch these entirely longer is

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,549
usually stronger and mandatory minimum

00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,899
length mandatory minimum length is the

00:22:53,549 --> 00:22:56,850
best way to get people to generate

00:22:54,899 --> 00:22:59,789
strong ones

00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:02,370
and tell your clients about dice where

00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:04,380
passwords by which I mean passwords made

00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:05,880
up of four or more random words which

00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,070
are easy for humans to remember in a

00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,230
sequence but hard for computers to guess

00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:11,700
what I've got on the slides here is an

00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:13,919
example of one that I generated last

00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,960
week this is a 40 character password

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,429
that isn't predictable it isn't a

00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,720
predictable sentence it's not a quote

00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:20,759
from Shakespeare or something like that

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,389
but it is definitely something that I

00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:25,769
could memorize if I really had to please

00:23:24,389 --> 00:23:27,330
make sure that your password policies

00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:29,340
support passwords that look like this

00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:31,759
one and don't reject it is weak because

00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:34,350
there are no symbols or numbers in it

00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:36,570
some password managers will generate

00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:37,529
passwords that look like this but if you

00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,789
don't have that option

00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:41,879
and you need to come up with one for

00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:43,350
yourself I like to mmm think of

00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:44,610
something that was on the shelf in my

00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:47,340
bedroom when I was a kid you know

00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:49,860
sequence of things in the order that I

00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,840
remember them or people suggest making

00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:54,120
up stories about the sequence of words

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,789
to help you remember all of these sorts

00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,950
of things pretty much anything that is a

00:23:56,789 --> 00:24:00,360
sequence that only you could think of if

00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:02,000
you can get it generated by machine

00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:05,129
that's probably the best way to do it

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,210
but good password policies are

00:24:05,129 --> 00:24:09,330
meaningless if you don't bring your

00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:10,889
users along for the ride and using dice

00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:12,720
web passwords is also pretty meaningless

00:24:10,889 --> 00:24:14,759
if you don't use a password manager to

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,990
record them because even though they're

00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:20,220
long and easier for humans to remember

00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:21,899
they're still really annoying and we

00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,460
still have so many accounts in our day

00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:25,019
to day lives that people will fall into

00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,059
that old trap of just repeating them

00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:29,070
over and over again and someone's

00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:31,049
unhatched unsalted database will get

00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:34,679
leaked it's inevitable and that password

00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:37,409
will become public so here's 0.4 a which

00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:39,240
is education for any of this to be

00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:41,279
really effective you need to educate

00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:44,129
people about good password hygiene and

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:46,019
tell them about password managers and by

00:24:44,129 --> 00:24:47,820
this I don't mean just your users

00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:50,220
specifically but also your friends and

00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,960
your family because good password

00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:54,470
practice goes way outside the scope of

00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:58,679
your work project this is a long-term

00:24:54,470 --> 00:25:01,350
real-life meatspace effort please gift

00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:03,720
people subscriptions or link them keep a

00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:05,669
ski pass ex teach people how to use

00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,679
password managers so that we can write

00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:08,460
password policies that generate strong

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:13,110
passwords

00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:14,820
I think password managers as kind of a

00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:17,880
band-aid on the whole problem of

00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:20,010
passwords they don't really so the fact

00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,350
that we have way too many passwords to

00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:24,630
deal with on a day to day basis but as

00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:27,960
the name suggests they do make par so

00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:29,940
it's easier to manage long strings like

00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,220
the ones I'm recommending and not so

00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,170
easy to handle without them there's

00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:37,890
LastPass and one password and key pass

00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:40,050
and - Lane and many all of them have

00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:41,970
their strengths and their weaknesses but

00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:44,460
using any one of them is better than

00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:47,750
using not at all so get out there and

00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:49,590
start showing people how to use them

00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:52,170
back within the scope of your work

00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:53,880
project a quick and easy way to educate

00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:55,950
your users about strong passwords is to

00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,630
give them automatic client-side feedback

00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:59,730
on the passwords that they give you when

00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:03,360
you're signing up an account with them

00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:05,700
or when they're changing Dropbox came up

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,700
with a really great tool called 0xe vbm

00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:10,890
which gives instant feedback to their

00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,940
user to your users on the strength of

00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:14,340
the passwords that they're trying to

00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:16,530
give you and give it determine strengths

00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:19,020
on how long a string would take to break

00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:20,400
in terms of time rather than what kinds

00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:23,340
of uppercase letters and lowercase

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,020
letters and symbols that it uses it also

00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,880
contains a really good dictionary of

00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:29,160
common words and leaked passwords to

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,140
help people avoid those and it's been

00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:37,130
ported to Python and a lot of other

00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:39,630
languages so go and try that out point 5

00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:41,280
rethink the idea of working on systems

00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:44,280
that are using biometrics is the only

00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:46,080
form of authentication this is the

00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,090
medium length form of a particular rant

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,140
of mine but the basic thrust of it is

00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:51,720
that if your parts of it gets

00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,490
compromised you can change it if your

00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:57,420
fingerprints get compromised it is very

00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:59,130
hard to grow new fingers and when I say

00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,810
compromised biometrics can be

00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:03,840
compromised in many more ways than a

00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:06,090
straight-up password can passwords get

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,970
leaked in database dumps and on post-it

00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:11,739
notes or actually my uber driver told me

00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:14,149
a hose on the way back from the airport

00:27:11,739 --> 00:27:16,940
but we keep coming up with new ways to

00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:19,690
steal and fake biometric or biometric

00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:22,129
information all the time late last year

00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:24,470
Adobe released a new piece of software

00:27:22,129 --> 00:27:27,080
called volcko which can generate samples

00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:30,320
of a human voice after being fed about

00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:33,529
20 minutes of speaking data so when I

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,690
don't have an epic cold I'm someone who

00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:37,279
narrates audiobooks in my spare time so

00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,809
I can really appreciate the idea of not

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,440
needing to be called back to this studio

00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:44,419
to do an extra 10 minutes of recording

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,429
but I am also someone who works really

00:27:44,419 --> 00:27:48,049
closely with authentication software and

00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:50,330
I can see the potential for someone to

00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:52,700
get one of my recordings even the

00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:55,279
recording of this talk and feed it to

00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:57,139
Vercoe and then have it rattle off the

00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,899
passphrase for my phone banking account

00:27:57,139 --> 00:28:01,820
and for anyone thinking of doing this

00:27:59,899 --> 00:28:03,229
you won't be able to do this with that

00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:06,710
service or with any other service I use

00:28:03,229 --> 00:28:08,929
please do not try but if you have ever

00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:11,479
given a conference talk or appeared in a

00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:14,299
recording be aware of what is becoming

00:28:11,479 --> 00:28:16,249
possible don't enroll yourself in this

00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:20,539
stuff and don't build it into your

00:28:16,249 --> 00:28:23,809
systems and there's more good news for a

00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:25,399
given value of good in January some

00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:27,440
researchers in Japan discovered that the

00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:29,450
average smartphone camera I can get can

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,909
capture detailed images of somebody's

00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:34,129
fingerprints from 3 meters away if the

00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:35,330
lighting is really good and this means

00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:37,369
that you can get fingerprint information

00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:39,590
from any Facebook selfie where you throw

00:28:37,369 --> 00:28:41,389
up a peace sign or you can steal a

00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:42,710
fingerprint pattern of a public figure

00:28:41,389 --> 00:28:45,200
if they were photographed close enough

00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:47,539
and they weren't wearing gloves not

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,429
unrelated ly a lot of recent

00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:50,629
breakthroughs in 3d printing and medical

00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:52,909
technology mean that we are getting

00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:55,399
better at printing human skin which is

00:28:52,909 --> 00:28:56,840
great news for a lot of people but it

00:28:55,399 --> 00:29:01,309
also means that all of that Gattaca

00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:02,749
style biometric fakery just got real but

00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:06,679
digital stealing and faking is the

00:29:02,749 --> 00:29:08,450
softer approach in 2005 an accountant in

00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:11,059
Malaysia parted company with one of his

00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:12,320
fingertips after the people who stole

00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:13,609
his Mercedes from him at gunpoint

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,029
realized that they needed his

00:29:13,609 --> 00:29:18,710
fingerprint 2 started slightly less

00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:20,599
violently there was the story of the

00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:22,519
six-year-old girl in Arkansas who used

00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:24,420
her mother's fingerprint while she was

00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:26,430
asleep to unlock her iPhone

00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:30,420
and rack up about 250 dollars worth of

00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:32,790
Pokemon toys biometric cloth looks

00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:34,350
really cool in the movies but the movies

00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:37,250
are also where people end up with their

00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:39,240
eyeballs being removed to bypass it and

00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:40,920
look I mean there's a lot of really cool

00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,500
stuff about living in the future but I

00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:45,750
don't want to bring this part into it so

00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,400
if you're working on a project that is

00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,720
thinking about it see if there's

00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,820
something else there that might fit that

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,040
need instead and if you must use

00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:55,080
biometrics make sure that they are only

00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,180
one part of several factors needed to

00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:59,130
authenticate because they're very easy

00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:02,030
to hack both technologically and

00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:06,690
socially six-year-olds can do it

00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:10,460
so to recap Salton hash implement MFA

00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:13,490
support u2f enable more than one MFA

00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:16,920
right proper password policies and

00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:20,760
educate people about passwords and say

00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:22,260
no to standalone biometrics and here's

00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,460
that link again to my notes and my

00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:28,140
resources in case you want to take a

00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:33,360
picture and look it up later and I'll

00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:35,550
tweet it just in case I know that these

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:38,070
are only really small things and this

00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:39,450
seems like really basic stuff and this

00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,500
stuff won't make the world perfect and

00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:42,780
they won't make people completely

00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,250
unhackable but they'll make the state of

00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,000
things a tiny bit better than the way

00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:48,060
that it was

00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:52,790
I would love a happy ending to the story

00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:52,790
of passwords so please help me write one

00:30:52,990 --> 00:31:02,099
