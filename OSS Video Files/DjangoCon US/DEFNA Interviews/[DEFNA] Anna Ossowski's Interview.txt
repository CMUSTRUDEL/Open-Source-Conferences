I was an attendee of the very first

00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:11,920
django girls workshop in 2014 in Berlin

00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:13,960
that Europe I thought and I started I've

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,849
organized several django girls events

00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,029
since then we've done one in budapest

00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:21,910
we've done one and at PyCon the most

00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:24,369
recent ones I did last year were no this

00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:28,119
year we're in Omaha Nebraska in February

00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:30,699
and also in San Francisco as part of my

00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:33,580
work so I've kind of organized workshops

00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:37,059
all over just not in my hometown funny

00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:39,580
enough so I'm kind of I guess the serial

00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:42,190
organizer you could call it and if also

00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:46,030
been involved in the organization of

00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:48,269
django con us since 2015 i'm involved in

00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:50,530
the organization of PyCon open spaces

00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:54,250
and it helped with the mobile guide a

00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:56,650
little bit and I also am on the PSF

00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,570
board so I have a non-traditional kind

00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,430
of IT background I actually wanted to

00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,920
become a high school teacher so I have

00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:06,070
an English degree I mean so Django Girls

00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:09,280
was kind of my in into the IT world and

00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:11,080
as we all know it's not difficult to get

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,810
your foot in the door and you like your

00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,490
first tech job and so I just needed to

00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,610
do something that looked good on my

00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:21,310
resume as like bad as that may sound

00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:23,110
but getting I quickly realized that

00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:26,230
getting involved in the community was

00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:29,350
sort of the best way to kind of do good

00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,880
for the community but also kind of help

00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:36,070
me find a job and meet people because

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,990
when it comes down to it I think the the

00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:41,380
best way to find jobs in tech is

00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:43,900
networking it's knowing people and so I

00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,580
kind of enjoyed the combination of doing

00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,020
something really fun you can't by

00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,990
organizing these workshops and events

00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:52,380
it's such a joy because you see people

00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:55,000
succeed you see them write their first

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,400
applications and websites and you see

00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,880
them start their careers but you know

00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:03,130
that you're also they're also benefiting

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,710
you because they it's something that you

00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:07,720
can put on your resume it's something

00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,099
that gets the word out about you and I

00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,590
think that's totally fine because

00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:14,410
organizing these events is a lot of work

00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,270
and so I think a lot of people shy away

00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,810
from doing them because they think oh I

00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,489
should

00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,280
do that why should I put all my time

00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:23,530
into doing something for other people I

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,360
can only say that like doing something

00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,670
for other people makes me happy I think

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,700
it's so cool to see others succeed and

00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:33,130
if it also helps me with my career then

00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:36,310
it's an additional benefit so it's kind

00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:39,300
of a time investment that is well worth

00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,300
it I would say

00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,480
so a lot of people always saying I have

00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:48,280
to put the together this like whole

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,620
workshop thing and that's not what you

00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,650
need to do like for example as Josue

00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,510
knows I run PI ladies remote and so it's

00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,510
this organization that we already have

00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:00,610
set up so if you don't want to start

00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:03,310
your own events you can get involved in

00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:05,320
other people's organizations that's also

00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:08,980
something that I would recommend is just

00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:11,140
start small you don't have to pull pull

00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,120
up the whole event on your own you can

00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:17,530
build a team around it and you can just

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,780
do one small task so if you don't want

00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,480
to start your own thing there's so many

00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,190
jingle girls workshops on the website if

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,590
there's one in your town ping the

00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:29,050
organizers say hey I live in this city I

00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:31,420
would like to help you and that way the

00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:35,680
whole like burden or load is not on you

00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:37,870
it's just on other people or Twitter is

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,690
a good way there are so many people on

00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:46,060
Twitter that continuously say hey I need

00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:48,340
help or if you've if you have experience

00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,580
with speaking at conferences become a

00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:54,280
speaker mentors start taking on one

00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:57,490
little task at a conference maybe become

00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,260
a sponsorship chair I think what keeps

00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:01,060
people from it is that they think oh my

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,210
god I'm gonna like have to do all these

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,700
things it's really not as much it can be

00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:09,370
a lot of work if you want it to be but I

00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:13,990
mean I do a ton of volunteer work in my

00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:16,450
free time I think and you can just

00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:19,270
dedicate a couple of hours a week to it

00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:21,940
so what I usually do is I will reserve

00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:23,980
two hours or so on a Thursday or Friday

00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,960
night when I have time and that's when I

00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:28,390
kind of do my volunteer things and it's

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,860
time in my calendar that's kind of like

00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:34,300
going to the gym for two hours a week or

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,820
meeting a friend for two hours a week as

00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,620
long as you're in your calendar I think

00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,140
it gets done so that's kind of what I

00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,210
would recommend start small don't think

00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,160
you have to do all the things and if you

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,440
I promise you if you start with one

00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,210
thing then you can get to doing other

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,610
things as we all know I started with

00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:54,569
Jenga girls and in came a Jenga come now

00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,849
Python now the PSF so it kind of

00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:58,949
you know depends on what do you want to

00:04:56,849 --> 00:05:01,499
do and also there's always the

00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:04,050
opportunity to step back that you don't

00:05:01,499 --> 00:05:06,419
have to do this like a lot of people do

00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,219
you all the time you can say I want to

00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:10,979
do this for two months out of the year I

00:05:08,219 --> 00:05:13,199
have time once a month to do something

00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:14,849
there are so many opportunities to get

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,039
involved you can teach your workshop

00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:18,839
maybe once a quarter for your local

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,059
meetup or something like that

00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:24,509
so it kind of depends what do you want

00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:27,770
to do which suits your personality now

00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:27,770
how much time you want to invest

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,630
I think the problem is twofold I think

00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:38,400
that a lot of people say I have time I

00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,440
want to help but they don't know where

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,320
to start so I think a lot of people just

00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:47,730
don't know where help is needed and I

00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:49,890
kind of always tell people I mean your

00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:52,620
help is always needed and so many people

00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:54,450
say yeah there's no jingle girls events

00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,220
in my town there are no tech events in

00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,590
my time and make it happen the best

00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,230
thing to get what you want is just to

00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,640
make it happen yourself and the the

00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,760
general girls for example they have

00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,880
really great organizer materials so even

00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,590
if you are kind of clueless of where to

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,540
even start they have a great organizer

00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:14,730
your manual which kind of walks you

00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:17,160
through the process step-by-step of what

00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:20,570
you need to do and it also really helps

00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,010
to have someone to kind of help you

00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:25,620
organize a workshop right doing it by

00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:27,900
yourself is only kind of half the fun so

00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:31,919
I would recommend get together with

00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:34,110
like-minded people and just kind of put

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,840
yourself out there the way I started

00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:39,030
organizing janggo girls is so or jinguk

00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,710
honest i just got in touch with Jeff

00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:43,110
Triplett on Twitter and I said hey I

00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:45,419
want to help and back then I was the

00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,280
only person in Europe and I was helping

00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:50,220
organize jinguk on us and it was a

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,930
little bit odd maybe but I help I

00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,570
started out helping with the Twitter and

00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:56,700
communications so there's so many things

00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,710
you can do and there's always help

00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:02,010
needed for jingle girls or the pie

00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:04,620
ladies or Django Cohn just put yourself

00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:09,479
out there and help and then in terms of

00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:11,790
what's the most difficult thing well I

00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:13,380
think it can be a stretch to kind of

00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,830
juggle your personal life and your job

00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:17,820
and organizing these events because

00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,710
organizing a jingle girl's event is

00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,479
going to take about three months out of

00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:24,300
your life and it's going to take up a

00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:26,820
lot of free time I'm in the fortunate

00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,919
position that I can do it is kind of

00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:33,479
part of my job so I can actually do it

00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:35,280
during work hours I would just I know

00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,560
that a lot of employers are actually

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,810
open to that if you are interested in

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,640
organizing a diversity-related event I

00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,719
would just like speak with your manager

00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,699
and say hey

00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:46,649
and this is what I'm doing can I maybe

00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:48,449
have three hours or two hours on a

00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:50,129
Friday to put my time towards this

00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:54,299
workshop that I'm organizing and I'm

00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:57,749
sure they'd be willing to agree I think

00:07:54,299 --> 00:08:00,569
people can also sometimes be hard to

00:07:57,749 --> 00:08:03,689
work with a technology is easy people

00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:05,639
are hard so it's yeah well you know we

00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:07,559
all know that like sometimes you like

00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,239
put so much effort into something and

00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:12,479
then people just don't respond to your

00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:14,819
emails or people are being grumpy and

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,339
not thankful but I think you always kind

00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:19,169
of have to remember why you do it and

00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:22,169
there are also a lot of like very

00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:26,599
grateful people so don't let the haters

00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:26,599
kind of keep you from doing good

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,399
so for pet ladies remote I think it's a

00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:36,289
cool concept because it's all remote

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,240
online classes so you can't actually

00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:40,250
teach a class from the comfort of your

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,039
home sitting on the on your couch

00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:46,519
wearing your pajamas if you want to and

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:49,160
so we ask people to teach classes from

00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:51,769
anywhere like starting at 30 minutes to

00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,149
about three hours so it kinda depends

00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:55,160
what do you want to do and it doesn't

00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:56,990
even have to be technical for example if

00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:00,529
you want to do a short 30-minute class

00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:02,839
or kind of like a short talk on writing

00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:06,290
conference proposals or how do I write a

00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:08,690
resume or I don't know something cool a

00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:10,820
cool feature you discovered in Django or

00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,890
so you were to reach out to us and you

00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,810
would give us your idea we set up

00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:17,959
everything for you we promote the class

00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:20,570
for you we find attendees and all you do

00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:22,399
is prep your class I'm not sure how long

00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:25,089
that would take usually a presentation

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,920
takes me couple of hours to prepare

00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:29,029
maybe but you also have to remember us

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,220
have you put together a presentation

00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:33,980
like this it's something you can reuse

00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,839
all the time right you can not only give

00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:39,190
it for pilotis remote you might maybe

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:42,110
give it at a conference one time or you

00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:44,630
you might give a webinar on your own or

00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:45,890
something like that we also record the

00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:48,680
video so it's great

00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:52,190
self-promotion for you it's not a ton of

00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:55,100
effort maybe five hours or so and it's

00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:57,680
just an easy way to help others to get

00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,240
involved and to just get the word out

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,760
these there's tons of meetups there's

00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:05,240
Python user groups hi ladies user groups

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,680
women and Tech women techmakers so just

00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:11,440
join your local meetup on meetup.com and

00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,970
you'll get email notifications and then

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,920
you can see if they're organizing any

00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:18,020
workshops or sometimes they will look

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,570
for teaching assistants or you can

00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,829
become a jingle girls coach for example

00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,440
if you don't want to organize the

00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:26,839
workshop you can spend a Saturday

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:30,589
teaching other people so there are so

00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:33,649
many opportunities that are pretty low

00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:35,959
key or like low time investment so a day

00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:39,820
you are there I think that's totally

00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:39,820
manageable for most people

00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:47,530
that's actually a different story so I'm

00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:50,530
Audrey green felt the author of two

00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:53,740
scoops of Jenga she reached out to me on

00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:56,710
Twitter and she said hey I'm trying to

00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,720
get to make the PSF board more diverse I

00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:00,670
think you're doing a lot of great things

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,320
with Jenga girls I think you would be

00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:06,130
great on the board I think you should

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,320
put yourself up for a nomination and I

00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,910
did it and I got voted in that was a

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,540
couple of years ago and then I took a

00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:16,690
break and then this time I just felt

00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:19,870
like doing it again I just felt like it

00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:21,580
was time for me to kind of I don't know

00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,710
I just wanted a new challenge I guess

00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:26,710
and that's why I put myself up for a

00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:28,390
nomination again and I also like have

00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:31,090
goals to kind of help the PSF with

00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:34,480
sponsorship and code of conduct and some

00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:37,030
other things yeah and so I just gave it

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,400
a shot and I got voted and again that's

00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:41,440
kind of how it happened that's also

00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,440
something you can do for the community

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,350
you can just encourage other people as

00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:50,590
you see like this one message by Audrey

00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:53,140
got me on the PSF board so or maybe you

00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:54,550
don't have a friend who who wants to

00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,170
organize something wants to speak at a

00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,980
conference but they're just a little bit

00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,500
shy about it

00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:03,760
just like send people encouraging words

00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:05,950
or send people a short email it's a

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,160
little encouragement goes such a long

00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:11,050
way so that's also something we don't

00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:15,000
think of but that's a great opportunity

00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:15,000
to kind of help the community out

00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:21,500
I think each different type of event has

00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:24,410
its own challenges

00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:27,530
I think Jenga con definitely is the

00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:29,660
biggest undertaking we as you have seen

00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:32,330
we spend about nine months out of the

00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:35,960
year planning django con and planning a

00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:40,430
conference for 300-400 people is just a

00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:42,650
huge undertaking but also for jinguk own

00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:45,050
I was involved in a very small part and

00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:47,720
so that on the other hand made it much

00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:50,930
more manageable for me I would say that

00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,240
Django girls workshops are quite

00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:56,360
challenging because you have so many

00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,880
moving parts for example jingo girls

00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:01,160
Omaha we put together with three people

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,470
and all of us were working full-time so

00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,690
we were kind of doing this in our free

00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:08,150
time but it's kind of manageable because

00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:10,460
you split up tasks one person find

00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:13,130
sponsors and then one person does social

00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:16,280
media promotion and then one person is

00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:19,850
in charge of communicating with people

00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:23,000
so it's you can kind of like split it up

00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:25,970
I I would say you need a plan when you

00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,150
start so Django girl's organizer manual

00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:32,900
is helpful think of sponsors you can

00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:35,300
contact like Daphna for example also

00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:40,250
elastic we give diversity sponsorships

00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:41,930
to also find local sponsors I think

00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:47,840
finding the money probably is the

00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:49,790
easiest thing I think just logistics can

00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,340
be a bit hard finding a venue can be a

00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:56,480
little bit hard people are sometimes

00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:59,650
flaky so people won't show up so I have

00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,650
a back-up plan for that

00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:06,480
what I would recommend and what's been

00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:09,090
successful like in my so far my job I

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,510
also organize events I run all of our

00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:14,520
meetups in Europe I think I would almost

00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:16,590
handle it like jobs

00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,410
so like have different job descriptions

00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:21,330
I know that the Django girls in Kansas

00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:23,790
City their workshop each year is super

00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:26,190
successful and the way they run it is

00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:28,230
they have actually like job positions

00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:31,080
they have a sponsorship person they have

00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:33,480
a volunteer coordinator they have an

00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:37,290
on-site coordinator they have a food and

00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:39,870
beverage coordinator so like define all

00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:43,050
these roles that you need kind of like

00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:44,940
you would like running an event it's

00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,950
almost like running a business it's kind

00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:50,160
of like you need different people that

00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:52,010
do different jobs and so list out all

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,330
the things you need done and the

00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,560
responsibilities and then maybe think of

00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:58,740
the time it will take

00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:01,020
and then just approach people with it

00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:03,870
because usually I think what scares

00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:06,330
people away isn't the unknown so if you

00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:08,580
tell people this is the time commitment

00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:10,590
I'm going to need from you and these are

00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:14,450
the tasks you will do people are usually

00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:14,450
much more open to helping you

00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:22,010
I wouldn't do it too big because once

00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:24,230
you get too many people involved then

00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:27,020
you're almost spent more time managing

00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,820
people and actually organizing so I

00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:31,130
would say do you like start maybe with

00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:34,250
three have one kind of main organizer

00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:36,350
and then two co-organizers because I

00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,450
think another thing we don't really talk

00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:41,840
about an open source of sustainability

00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:44,450
so we have all these great people who

00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:47,180
are engaged and once you organize things

00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:49,340
but the reality is that people's living

00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:51,650
situations change or your priorities

00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,300
change and so people may say after a

00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:56,600
while I can't do it anymore for whatever

00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:58,070
reason and so we kind of need to help

00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,890
building the next generation of

00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:03,490
organizers and so if you keep splitting

00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:05,990
the workload but you also have like

00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:07,970
co-organizers for example for python the

00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:10,990
way we do it is we have one chair and

00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:14,210
two co-chairs for each position and then

00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:16,190
the chair does it for two years at a

00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:18,200
time and then one of the co-chairs moves

00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:20,600
up and then we fill another co-chair

00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:23,060
position so it kind of like keeps moving

00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,760
and like bringing in new people sharing

00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:29,200
the knowledge and you also prevent that

00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,200
people get burned out that way

00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:36,390
I kind of have a simple rule if you

00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:38,850
don't think he'll yes say no so if

00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:40,950
someone approaches me with an

00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:44,180
opportunity and I don't I don't really

00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:49,470
get excited about it I won't do it

00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:51,660
because I think or like everyone I have

00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:53,400
a problem saying no but I know that if I

00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,230
keep saying yes I just keep piling

00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,230
things on my plate and ultimately that's

00:16:55,230 --> 00:17:00,600
going to make me unhappy and with Django

00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:03,390
Khan I just kind of had this like inner

00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,510
feeling it's almost coming up to three

00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:08,640
years I'm actually moving cities so I

00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:11,490
also kind of want to prioritize my

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,440
personal life a little more I've served

00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:15,300
the community a lot and now it's kind of

00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:18,330
like time to look after myself a little

00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:21,900
more I'm out I also took on this PSF

00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:25,560
thing which is a huge job and so I

00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:28,440
needed to get rid of something else on

00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,600
my plate and I do love the Django con

00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,580
people but there were it's just a

00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,720
feeling that told me it's time to pass

00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,700
it on to someone else

00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,310
so if you feel like you're not totally

00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:40,590
enjoying yourself anymore I think then

00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:44,460
it's a good time to quit with it a lot

00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:47,490
of my work also was just kind of doing

00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:49,140
CFP outreach so to be quite honest with

00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:51,480
you I will probably do that again next

00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:54,480
year when the time comes just not under

00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:57,270
the official title diversity chair and I

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,040
think things like diversity work should

00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,990
not fall back on one person it's kind of

00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,720
a team effort we all need to reach out

00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:05,460
to people so I'm not sure if you do

00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,110
actually need a dedicated diversity

00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,780
cheer again I think the team can

00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:12,110
probably fill in and help how bad with

00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,110
what I did

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,030
just make a list of like people that you

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,309
think might be willing to help and just

00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:24,140
approach them personally I mean putting

00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:25,760
it on social media is one thing it's

00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,980
usually pretty successful if you have a

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,820
good following or if you can get people

00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:33,830
to retweet you but I think it's a

00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:36,320
usually pace off to reach out to people

00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:38,179
personally and you also want to pick

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,280
people that you get along with right

00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:43,070
because this is something you do in your

00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,720
free time so you don't like where's at

00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:46,490
work I sometimes need to work with

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,650
people that I might not like but they're

00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:50,960
my co-workers so I kind of have to get

00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:53,210
along with them but for volunteer things

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,330
I think if you do have a choice choose

00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:57,980
people that you enjoy working with your

00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:01,309
friends or people you've met at

00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:02,750
conferences or I don't know like

00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:05,000
sometimes I will just look through my

00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,890
Twitter list and just message random

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,059
people that I think might be interested

00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:14,270
in helping me and asking for help is

00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:17,270
hard because we are all scared of

00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:18,590
getting rejected right but if you you

00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:20,929
don't ask for help the answers

00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:24,340
automatically no if you do ask for help

00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:26,540
and the answer might actually be yes

00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:30,050
yeah there is there's a great book by

00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:32,120
Amanda Palmer the art of asking I

00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:34,670
recently read it and I would recommend

00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,740
it to anyone it's really it's really

00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:39,080
cool I think it actually applies to

00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:42,320
organizing events and asking for help in

00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:44,570
a lot of ways so yeah just ask people

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,270
that's that's what I would recommend

00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:49,520
just like pick random people even the

00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:51,290
ones you think might maybe not help

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:55,730
usually those are the ones who will say

00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:58,610
yes so or I don't know put it on

00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:01,790
LinkedIn put it on Facebook but the best

00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:05,000
way is just reach out to people you know

00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:07,100
also there's a ton of different slack

00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,170
groups the Django girls have a slack

00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:11,570
group that PI ladies have one we have

00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:15,230
one for Django con there's a women in

00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:17,630
tech one yeah it also depends are you

00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:19,460
organizing an event in your town then

00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:21,710
you obviously want local people if

00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,300
you're organizing an event online or in

00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:26,470
a different town then it really doesn't

00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,470
matter where people live

00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:33,490
a job I'm currently in the position that

00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:36,220
I can give away elastics money which is

00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:39,400
really nice but asking for money is

00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:44,530
really hard so I totally would encourage

00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:48,130
people to do a probe with folks like

00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:51,810
definite with you almost no answer is

00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:55,510
going yeah yes for the PSF where's

00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:59,170
corporate sponsors sometimes might say

00:20:55,510 --> 00:21:01,600
no but you kinda have to remember that

00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:03,940
like even so I used to do fundraising

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:07,150
Opena professionally for Django rest

00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:09,550
framework and the rule of thumb is kind

00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:11,470
of like for one for each ten emails you

00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:14,340
send out you might get one person to

00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:16,360
respond to you but you have to remember

00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:18,100
first of all you're doing it for the

00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,410
greater good so you're not asking for

00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,910
money for yourself to pay for a render

00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:23,650
or something you're asking for an event

00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:27,040
you're putting on for other people and

00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:29,020
also if people say no they're not

00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,580
rejecting you as a person they might

00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,980
just it might not fit into their

00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:35,280
sponsorship profile they might be out of

00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,280
budget

00:21:37,469 --> 00:21:43,719
my thoughts on that are kind of complex

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,820
so the problem is that the most diverse

00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:48,700
people usually are probably the ones

00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:52,359
that don't have the time and the time

00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:56,409
can also be money to to make these

00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:58,749
efforts because in a way being able to

00:21:56,409 --> 00:22:00,519
have free time to organize events for

00:21:58,749 --> 00:22:03,279
other people as a privilege there are

00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:05,229
other people who do not have the free

00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:07,299
time that I have because they actually

00:22:05,229 --> 00:22:10,059
have to work because otherwise they

00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:12,159
can't make a living and but the problem

00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:14,049
is that usually those people who

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,299
actually you shouldn't be asking because

00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:18,849
they don't they can't really spare time

00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:22,450
they are usually the ones who like kind

00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:26,469
of will move everything to help you if

00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:28,959
you ask me and this goes against all

00:22:26,469 --> 00:22:31,570
diversity principles I think we should

00:22:28,959 --> 00:22:34,479
ask like the white tech bros to help us

00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:36,639
more because they're the ones who have

00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:42,359
the good Silicon Valley jobs they make

00:22:36,639 --> 00:22:45,339
the money they have the time so I think

00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:47,559
yeah I don't know I don't know how to

00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:49,059
solve this problem I think diversity is

00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:53,979
something that everyone should be

00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:56,709
concerned with and I think that everyone

00:22:53,979 --> 00:22:59,499
kind of needs to help not just not just

00:22:56,709 --> 00:23:02,200
women not just LGBT folks not just

00:22:59,499 --> 00:23:02,799
people of color I think we all need to

00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,999
help

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:09,339
and so just approach everyone even there

00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:11,349
are so many people that don't get

00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:13,119
diversity yet because they they don't

00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:15,429
have problems they never get harassed

00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:18,669
they don't have to trouble finding a job

00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:20,619
and so approach these people maybe like

00:23:18,669 --> 00:23:22,929
specifically these people to kind of

00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:25,169
like teach them a lesson how hard it can

00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:25,169
be

00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,110
I think what you always have to remember

00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:35,540
is like something to get really stressed

00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:38,510
I think what I would tell my past self

00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:41,120
is it's going to work out just fine like

00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:43,160
in the end no one is going to notice if

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,200
your cupcakes are missing or if the

00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:49,340
decoration is then turn out exactly the

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:52,160
way you'd plan it to be so it's going to

00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:54,800
end up just fine you are always your

00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,870
hardest critic but people will still

00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,000
really enjoy your workshop no matter how

00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:02,690
much swag you have and how good the food

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,640
is volunteering has taught me a lot so I

00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:06,410
think that volunteering curly has taught

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,350
me more than any job I've ever had

00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:11,180
because you kind of get thrown into like

00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:14,060
the ocean and you have to figure out how

00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:16,220
and learn how to swim but it's going to

00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:19,040
kind of like give you so many skills

00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:22,190
which you can also learn which you can't

00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:24,110
transfer it to a job like fundraising

00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:26,510
it's a skill that I've acquired by

00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:28,730
organizing events that a lot of people

00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:31,190
don't have and it benefits me at my job

00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:33,860
but also at other volunteer initiatives

00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:35,870
or networking I used to be a really shy

00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:38,840
person I would have never gotten on a

00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:40,790
video call like this and can organizing

00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:44,480
events has taught me to like be more

00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:47,200
open minded with people or just asking

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:51,770
for help or just organizational skills

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:54,800
logistics money management just like old

00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:58,670
like people skills just like all these

00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:00,950
different kind of like soft skills that

00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:02,900
you might not acquire other ways so I

00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:04,760
think that's a huge benefit and that's

00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:07,880
why I would recommend to anyone that

00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,560
even if it's a bit scary I can tell you

00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,820
it's going to be fine and you will learn

00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,820
a lot and you want to regret it

00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:20,620
well if you ask me I think the future is

00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:22,660
smaller local events I think we're

00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:25,600
already seeing a trend kind of going

00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:28,210
there and I think we we recently had a

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,730
Django day in Copenhagen for example or

00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:33,040
I think there's several Django days or

00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:37,510
Django conferences popping up in Asia so

00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:40,299
I think we also have to consider that by

00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:42,670
bringing the events so I'm a big fan of

00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:44,320
bringing the events to the people and

00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:46,480
not asking the people to travel to the

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:51,250
event because since we're talking

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,690
diversity there's visa issues of the

00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:56,830
current political you're dealing with

00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:59,500
visa so you know there's a lot of people

00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:02,200
don't have the finances I mean traveling

00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:04,000
a Django con of you from Europe if my

00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,160
employer wouldn't pay for it what easily

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,860
cost me two thousand euro out of pockets

00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:12,520
and that's that's money that people

00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:14,860
don't have and so you can I think that

00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:19,530
our future is just organizing smaller

00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:19,530
one-day events and where the people are

00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:26,760
if you work for a Django shop or you

00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:28,620
work for a Python shop or so then you're

00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,710
I mean it's great marketing for your

00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:34,370
employer right and maybe they'll be able

00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:36,750
to sponsor a little bit give you like

00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:39,179
$2,000 or something maybe they can't

00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:41,490
even provide a space and then give you a

00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:43,799
little bit of time to organize it so I

00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:46,350
mean worst case your manager or employer

00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:49,320
says no best case they say yes so I

00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:53,070
definitely would feel it out and ask

00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:55,470
them I think it's it's great marketing I

00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:58,559
kind of work in like developer marketing

00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:02,270
a little bit so I know that if I ask my

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,270
employer they'd say yes so

00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:09,029
mm so one thing I wanted to mention and

00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,830
it's something you could bring up with

00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:13,039
your employer with elastic we get

00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:16,049
something it's called volunteer time off

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:18,210
so each employee gets five days a year

00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:21,059
to volunteer for a cause of their choice

00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:23,419
so I actually used mine last year to

00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:25,799
organize the jingle gross omaha workshop

00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:28,440
so that's really awesome if you think

00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:30,480
about it so maybe don't ask your

00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,519
employer for five whole days but maybe

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,009
bring up the concept of like asking for

00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:38,059
a day hey can we start doing our like

00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:40,289
one day a quarter or something like that

00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:43,169
you also have something called space

00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:45,869
time for the engineering team where you

00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:48,269
can take up to a week per quarter to

00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:51,330
work on something you don't have time

00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:52,529
for doing work so if you say hey why

00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,360
don't you learn this new programming

00:27:52,529 --> 00:27:57,779
language then you would take space time

00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:59,879
for it or so but that's yeah I realize

00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:04,919
that that's not a standard thing to do

00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:08,820
so as I already mentioned don't fill up

00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:11,490
your plate too full so kind of like

00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:15,330
listen to yourself like try to have a

00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:17,669
good work-life balance like don't don't

00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:20,399
do all volunteer stuff because in the

00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:22,139
end it's not gonna make you happy

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,879
because you'll burn out so you need to

00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:26,580
kind of find a schedule that's

00:28:23,879 --> 00:28:29,159
sustainable for you so as I said I have

00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:33,360
in my calendar like every week for an

00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:36,629
hour or two I work on PSF things or hi

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,460
ladies remote is super easy because we

00:28:36,629 --> 00:28:41,309
are three people and we do one class

00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:44,009
among so I do it every three months and

00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:46,080
they have that in my calendar we also

00:28:44,009 --> 00:28:48,570
have Trello boards I'm a huge fan of

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,220
Trello so I have for almost all my

00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:54,149
volunteer things I have a Trello board

00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:56,429
where I just collect my ideas yeah my

00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:59,369
tips are just use your calendar put it

00:28:56,429 --> 00:29:01,019
in your calendar I think if it's not in

00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:02,610
your calendar it won't get done whether

00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:05,269
that's going to the gym or learning a

00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:09,539
new language or volunteering for a thing

00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:13,070
also be organized and pick the things

00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:15,690
that you enjoy so if it's something

00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:17,880
there's one thing about like you know

00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:20,100
like we all know working out is good and

00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,980
we force ourselves to the gym sometimes

00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:25,170
and but that's different than forcing

00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:27,480
yourself to volunteer so when it comes

00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:30,210
to volunteering there's something you

00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:33,570
don't like take take a break or just

00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:37,080
don't don't commit to something you

00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:42,330
don't enjoy doing yeah I don't think I

00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:44,880
have any other secrets also yeah pick

00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:47,790
something with fun people so usually

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,340
like I really enjoy jinguk on because of

00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:54,360
all your coop the cool people Jeff

00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:59,280
Triplett Lacey yeah just like a cool

00:29:54,360 --> 00:30:02,700
people but also try to do things that

00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:04,890
are non tech related I think in in tech

00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:07,200
we we all sort of have the problem that

00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:11,040
tech kind of takes over our whole life

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:13,440
I'm definitely guilty of that so I'm

00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:16,710
kind of like actively saying no I'm

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,440
moving to London I want to live life

00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:21,690
outside of tech so maybe force yourself

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,360
also to pick up a hobby that's not in

00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:26,850
tech related for example I picked up on

00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:29,520
cross stitching last winter because I

00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:31,710
wanted to do something different so

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:35,130
don't make your whole life about tech

00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:38,040
also find friends outside of tech it's

00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:40,410
not really healthy to only surround

00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:43,200
yourself with tech people because tech

00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:45,210
is this bubble and then when you talk to

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,250
you like non tech people about it you

00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:49,530
kind of like catch yourself sometimes

00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:51,570
like sounding really stupid or they

00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:54,480
don't really understand your issues or

00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:58,370
so and then you can start realizing okay

00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:01,590
life is really about something else so

00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:04,410
yeah kind of see it as a hobby that you

00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:07,340
dedicate a couple of hours a week to but

00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:07,340
don't overdo it

00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:13,330
like if you think about it when you like

00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:15,970
organize of jingle girls workshop for

00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:18,909
example you need a room you need coaches

00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:20,710
and many participants people can't go

00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:22,059
and get lunch if you can't provide the

00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:23,350
food you don't really need decorations

00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:25,630
they're fun

00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:27,940
you don't need swag I mean swag is also

00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:30,309
fun but like we get like overloaded with

00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:32,590
so much swag so does it really matter if

00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:36,100
you have stickers at your events or or

00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:37,960
not so I think you can I think we stress

00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,940
out too much and that's why so many

00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,950
people shy away from that because what

00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:45,669
it really comes down to are those recent

00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:48,159
three things and that like mentioning

00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:50,890
that I think you can also run a joint

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:53,470
jingle girl's event at very low cost so

00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:55,390
like even if you say I'm gonna provide

00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:58,600
sandwiches like you don't need fancy

00:31:55,390 --> 00:32:00,520
food I mean get Subway sandwiches for 30

00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,970
people or so and you will spend I don't

00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:06,640
know a $300 on it so I think you could

00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:10,179
totally run a workshop with very low

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:12,309
cost and very low efforts and yeah

00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:13,809
people might be a little bit

00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:16,690
disappointed you don't have fancy

00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:19,000
cupcakes fancy decorations but in the

00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,950
end they will still write their first

00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,570
application and that's what really

00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:25,270
matters and that's what they'll remember

00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:27,220
like when I when I think of conferences

00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:30,429
that I've attended honestly what I

00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:32,620
remember most is the people like I don't

00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:34,570
remember what kind of logo did PyCon

00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:36,880
have three years ago or like what kind

00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:39,070
of fancy food that they have but I

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,100
remember oh I met this person there and

00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:44,640
they became my friend or so so focus on

00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,640
the people

00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:55,810
PyCon PyCon is kind of my family reunion

00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:57,850
every year and KY Tennessee is kind of

00:32:55,810 --> 00:33:00,310
special to me because I gave my first

00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:02,410
ever conference talk there

00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:05,370
I usually don't miss Django Khan I am

00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:05,370
going to miss it this year

00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:12,780
yeah I mean I think I saw one talk

00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:15,450
besides mine because I wanted to support

00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:17,250
the speaker but if I think about it like

00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:19,650
really like most of my time was like

00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:23,100
spent talking to people and so as I said

00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:25,680
like PyCon is my big family reunion but

00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:27,720
I think also my opinion on this has

00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,640
evolved like if I look back three years

00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:32,010
to make three years ago to my first hike

00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,840
on I was like stressing myself out

00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:36,000
because I wanted to like go to all the

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:40,230
talks and do all the happy hours and so

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,680
on and now I just say skip all the talks

00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:45,150
and just focus on the people because the

00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,710
talks you can watch on YouTube but you

00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:50,040
can't take the people home and the

00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:52,520
people are what brings me happiness and

00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:55,080
what's also helped me in my career

00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:57,330
that's actually a funny story say I met

00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,040
Trey at PyCon a couple years ago and who

00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:00,930
just came up to me in the hallway and he

00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,460
was like I know you're French whitter

00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,990
you're friends with those other friend

00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,930
of mine so I thought you must be a

00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:09,240
friendly person and so we started

00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:11,669
hanging out and now Trey's like one of

00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:15,150
my best friends like I talk to him every

00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:16,770
week and yeah he's awesome so like you

00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:19,410
can kind of see that you can actually

00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:22,470
make like really like meaningful

00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:26,450
connections I just like attending events

00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:26,450
