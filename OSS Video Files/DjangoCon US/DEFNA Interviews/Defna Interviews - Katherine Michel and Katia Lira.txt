us

website chair or co-chair depending on

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,960
the year

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,320
hi my name is katialira i'm from mexico

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,680
city

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:45,680
i'm a full-stop developer with python

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,920
at a canadian company called local logic

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,640
i'm also a board member i'm vice

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,879
president of devsna

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,199
i work on the community communications

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:58,320
team at djangocon us

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,559
and that's it so uh

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,800
let's start with if you have any

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,360
recommendations on how to manage like

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,479
presence social presence for a

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,520
conference

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,439
i think that it kind of helps to

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,720
understand how

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,119
defna and djangocon us organizers work

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,759
together

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,000
since i'm the djangocon us website chair

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:27,840
my perspective is from the point

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,840
of managing the website process

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,920
for deafna

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,840
you know i got involved with the website

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,799
because it was of interest to me

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,600
we managed the high level contracts for

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,720
djangocon

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,399
west so a few years ago

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,520
i created a cfp where we outlined

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,640
the requirements for the website

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,439
and i kind of based that on the websites

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,560
from the past

00:01:53,439 --> 00:02:00,880
but that's really important

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:04,479
because it made it very clear what we

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:08,560
needed from a design agency

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,560
so the way that it works is that

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,200
around the beginning of the year we

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,120
launch a landing page

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,760
and then during the first quarter of the

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,720
year jeff triplett who is the president

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,680
of defna

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,040
he and i meet with the design agency and

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,560
we choose a design

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,720
and we kind of iterate on that

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,239
fortunately sometimes other people get

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,680
involved and give their feedback which

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,480
is great

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,040
and eventually the landing page becomes

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:41,280
the full-fledged site

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:44,319
we have a slack organization where

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,879
we have a definite channel and a website

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,640
channel

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:52,160
and a communications team that

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,280
works on blog posts and works on

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,879
tweets and facebook posts and

00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,400
we're active in that slack organization

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,720
throughout the year

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,800
and i think that makes it run really

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,239
smoothly because everyone

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,239
kind of knows what their role is and we

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,480
kind of know what

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,280
the specific requirements are and we

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,879
have a time

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,920
frame too and so

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,000
that helps move things along really well

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,799
in my opinion

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,680
as for the social presence

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,360
outside of websites i would say that the

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,280
biggest difference for defna and

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,920
djangocon us is that

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,720
we have a lot of content for conferences

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,920
meaning

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,280
speakers they call for proposals every

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,799
step of the way can be

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,319
a blog post or or a tweet something

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,400
something is there and for when you're

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:52,239
managing a non-profit

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,239
foundation or organization you have to

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,519
think about the content that you're

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,599
going to put out

00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,760
what we're trying to do at devnet is is

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,439
translating our knowledge for how to run

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,319
a conference into content that

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,200
other conferences or other organizations

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,599
can

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,120
can have so uh i would say that's that's

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,480
the biggest difference because you have

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,439
to work harder to

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,840
to get the content do you see is is

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,040
there

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,320
any any specific media more uh

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,639
more traffic from or twitter or facebook

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,080
or

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,160
like slack it depends on

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,120
the process for example when the call

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,800
for proposals

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,479
it's about to close there's a lot of

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,280
interaction on twitter

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,160
uh when the actual company conferences

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,440
is happening

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,520
and that that happens the same um

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,360
but for slack what i've seen is that all

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,639
year round it's active

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,440
a few messages a day or a week so that

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,759
that's also a downside of that i would

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,560
say

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,840
is that we all we have to be aware of

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,600
those messages and

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,880
and keep an eye on that because of code

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,400
of conduct

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,199
instances that could happen and but yeah

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,560
the that's like is alive all year what

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,639
do you what do you think

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,320
are like the the the first steps always

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,479
for a conference to kind of

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,840
start or launch the website of a

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,840
conference i mean what are like the

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,000
first things that we always

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,039
look at in the beginning of a new year

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,120
and all that

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:28,400
well i we're really lucky because um

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,360
we the the process we have in place

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,160
we the people who are involved we always

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,080
have enough people with experience that

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,560
um we already know a lot of the

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,120
important things and so

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,639
for the website in general it's really

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,960
important

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,120
that it be responsive of course so that

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,720
it works on a lot of devices

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,199
it's really important that it be

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,000
acceptable because we want

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,479
everyone to have a great user experience

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,479
and

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,919
for me personally it's also really

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:02,400
important to have

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:05,039
a link available to our code of conduct

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,840
all the time so that people know that

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:11,039
it's a welcoming safe space

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,720
when we launch the landing page um it's

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,720
up kind of the very beginning and so we

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,400
there's not much there it's kind of the

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,000
bare minimum but

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,440
the important information is that we

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,960
want to have

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,520
the date and the location we want to

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,080
have

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,840
some kind of marketing blurb to get

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,800
people excited about it

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,319
and we want to have a link to sponsor

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,319
information because we're going to want

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,919
to try to get sponsors involved as

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:42,160
quickly as we can

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:45,759
and then as the design

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,800
the full design kind of comes together

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,960
and we replace the the landing page with

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,759
the actual design

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,240
we're going to be updating it over time

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,520
um

00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,400
so that we'll have like a ticket link

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,360
hotel or accommodation information then

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,479
we're going to have

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,759
like a call for proposal

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:10,319
information and link and opportunity

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:14,000
grant information and link

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:18,000
speaker information a thing

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,400
that also of course sponsor information

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,759
a thing that i think is really cool

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,319
about djangocon us

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,599
is that we care so much about diversity

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,400
and inclusion

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,319
um it's a priority to have accessibility

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,639
information on our site

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,560
and then of course like the schedule

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,080
eventually

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,720
and then fun stuff like things around

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,880
the

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,479
the city that people might like to do

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,800
that you don't have to have that but

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,599
it's really cool to have that on there

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,080
yeah when one of the things that katie

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,639
mentioned

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,840
is that we have a lot of people that

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,560
have knowledge and

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,000
help us out throughout the year and

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,080
additional to that

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,319
we also have a lot of new people coming

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,639
in every year because it's so easy

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,680
to contribute with us because we have uh

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,960
good documentation

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:10,240
and great people helping uh newcomers

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,319
and what that does is that those people

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,360
those new people always have like fresh

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,879
eyes and have

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,720
more ideas and then maybe us that we've

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,199
been doing this for a few years

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,000
so it's evolving constantly because of

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,080
that that

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,039
new people keep coming in every every

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,639
single year

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,240
yeah that's one thing that that's really

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,639
good and i think also

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,479
also that that has to do with how the

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,800
website itself is hosted

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,919
um and can you talk a little bit about

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,680
that like what

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,440
what are the services that we're using

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,360
and the reason why

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:46,320
we chose it sure so um

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,519
right before i became the djangocon us

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,279
website chair

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:54,160
the site was made in django and

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,519
someone before me decided to switch to

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,040
jekyll

00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,160
and basically the way that it works is

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,320
that the code

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:07,519
is hosted in a github repo

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:11,040
in our djangocon us website organization

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:14,560
the main code is in the master branch

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:19,519
and it's actually

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:22,640
staged and served through um netlify

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:25,519
and this gives us

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,839
um a major benefit because when somebody

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,880
submits a pull request

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:34,000
mobilify automatically creates a

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,360
static site off of the pr

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,399
and people can see the change to the

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,760
site

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,440
um before the pr is merged

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,120
in terms of using jekyll i know

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,160
sometimes people think it's kind of

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,839
weird that you have

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,680
a conference about a programming

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,880
language and you don't need it to make

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,800
the site

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:57,920
but using jekyll actually

00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,480
lowered the barrier of entry

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,560
to get started contributing so our

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,120
number of contributors

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,519
went up drastically because people are

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,720
able often to go into

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,600
um you know maybe fork the repo and go

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,920
into the browser and make a small edit

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,760
to contribute and before it was a bit

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:23,279
more complex than that um

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,880
so from year to year where we're able to

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,800
usually reuse the code maybe make some

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,399
development enhancements but

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:36,399
primarily create a new design and

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:39,839
um it is working really well right now

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:42,720
for the devnet website we used to have

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,720
it hosted with squarespace it was a

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,399
great solution for a while because

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,720
of how easy it was to have a design

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,680
but it became eventually a bit expensive

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,640
for for us

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,360
so we switch the same to jekyll but i

00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,959
think it's hosted on github pages

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,680
and it's very easy to

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,880
publish a blog post because it's mostly

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,360
done in markdown

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,240
so you don't really have to do anything

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,760
with design

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,839
the contributions that you were talking

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,880
about catherine can you

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,240
remember any any examples about like

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,959
what are the different

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,240
types of contributions that other like

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,640
attendees have done

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,279
or other people or are we talking about

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,120
mainly

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:30,560
just like the uh the organizers

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,040
um it can be anyone um

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,000
when the actual design and development

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,519
are being done

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,040
it's the design agency that is pushing

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:44,880
most of the updates but then we have

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:48,640
people who are organizers who help

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:52,000
fetch the talk tutorial

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,600
information from whatever site is

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,639
hosting the cfp

00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:01,040
so that we can generate

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:05,120
the talk and tutorial pages on the site

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:07,920
organizers and speakers may

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,279
realize that they want to update their

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,200
personal information

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,639
or change their talk title and they're

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,519
totally welcome to just

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,800
come along and update it i a few years

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,639
ago

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:23,440
created some contributing guidance and

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,160
it was really important to me to make it

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,519
uh very

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,120
straightforward to contribute so we can

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,279
direct people to the contributing

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,440
guidance we can mentor them

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,959
and they're welcome to come along and

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,560
make an update

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,800
yeah so so what about the uh the design

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,560
from like uh i mean i i think it it's

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,800
it's a good idea to kind of compare

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,760
the everything that happens on the

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,399
design on

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,839
on djangocon's uh website and for

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,200
instance devnet's website

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,040
and especially since we're going through

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,240
the whole like redesign

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,120
uh and i'm i think it's it's very

00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,839
interesting

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,680
mainly like the timeline on how all of

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,399
this happens like whenever there's like

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,720
propositions and i mean proposals and

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,360
then

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,240
one of those is chosen on all that do

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,079
you all think

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,800
like it's taking more time to do

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,240
the redesign in devnet than the work

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,600
that needs to do

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:23,519
to be done every year for daniel

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,760
well it's actually kind of like i think

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,399
built into our contract that there's a

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,519
specific timeline

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,200
um and we basically just adhere to it

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,320
plus

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,480
people working on it have mostly

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,560
been involved for several years now so

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,000
they kind of like know

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:47,920
they they kind of just have an idea of

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,600
how it goes um and so it goes really

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,320
smoothly because it's something that's

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,800
done from year to year

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,519
for devnet rebranding i think it's

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,560
taking

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,519
uh a bit more time because it's the

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,600
first time that we

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:06,000
do it and you have to

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,959
take in consideration seven uh points of

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,199
view uh

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,120
in with djangoconus it's a process

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:14,399
that's very well

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,360
defined and it's also only katy

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,320
jeff and myself in that process so i

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:31,839
think it's

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:34,959
easier to move along that way

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,240
yeah it definitely when i first was the

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,440
website chair

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,920
uh it was much lower

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,160
and they actually tried some other board

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,199
members i think tried to recruit more

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,760
people

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:50,000
to join our meetings the next time to

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,480
try to move along the decision making

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,320
and then this year it was like much much

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,839
faster and easier maybe

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,519
for one thing when you first do

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,120
something you want it to be like really

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,360
really good and you're just

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,720
maybe agonizing over every detail and

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,920
then you sort of relax

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,120
and go okay now i now we i have a sense

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,320
of what we're doing and it

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,440
you know you can um

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,480
sit back a bit more and and worry less

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,680
because you've already

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,680
gone gone through it and proven

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,120
maybe proven something to yourself i

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,000
guess

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,639
and also johnny uh i think she knows the

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,920
conference

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:30,240
and us well enough that she can

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,519
have great ideas from the very very

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,920
beginning we worked

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,639
on several times so that's also good at

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,360
like

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,160
a key point there to to get somebody

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,639
that

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,800
that already or at least that's already

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,959
worked with the other conferences right

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,800
you might not have to have everyone the

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,040
same but yeah

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,000
i know it does help to have some of the

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,839
same people

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,600
yeah so and and what about the the

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,480
content itself like there's there's a

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,160
bunch of things

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,920
i think like for instance in a

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,120
conference websites

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,600
uh that or a lot of the company just

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,680
kind of

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,079
starts building itself right like for

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,639
instance all the details for the sponsor

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,519
so that's

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,399
like things a little bit more like legal

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,519
specific

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,720
and and i don't know like the list of of

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,720
people that are going to speak

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,199
and the topics and all that so that's

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,920
kind of like it creates by itself right

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,480
but there is a bunch of other content

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,320
that

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,000
you have to figure out if you want to

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,440
put it there or not like for instance

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,480
one i think it's like videos and

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,519
pictures from the actual conference and

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,480
another one it's uh like maybe the

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,440
things that

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,040
that you were talking about like uh

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,800
interesting things to do

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,079
at the city that the conference is gonna

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,480
happen right

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,240
so can you can you talk a little bit

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,720
more about like this type of content

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,639
that

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:55,680
it's good to have but is not your

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,639
like legal usual structure of a

00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,720
conference

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:05,120
um so we kind of been

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,199
a little bit um spoiled the last couple

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,079
years because we had the

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,959
the conference in the same location

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,199
because we

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:17,520
reused the site uh we were able to reuse

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,480
a lot of the content

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,760
um but what happens usually is that

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,240
among the organ

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,959
organizers there are people who are

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,240
chairs

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,640
or co-chairs or kind of have taken

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,320
leadership of a certain area

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:37,039
and i have been

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,720
maybe when the site is ready to launch i

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,520
go back to one of the

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,039
the past sites and i look through the

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,880
github to see what we

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,720
did or didn't have there when we

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,520
launched and i go in

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:54,799
and i sort of update the new site

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,320
based on that to make sure that we have

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,160
what we should or shouldn't have in

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,840
there but the people who

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:05,679
kind of own a certain subject

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:08,880
area they will

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:11,520
come in and contribute

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,080
the content related to their area and i

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,559
will just keep like checklists

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,000
and go through and make sure that it's

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:21,120
completed

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,480
so like the people who are in charge of

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,080
like cfp stuff or sponsorship

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,400
things like this they will make the

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,679
decision about it

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,720
and that seems to work really well going

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,559
back to

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,960
being spoiled i think we have a great

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,200
team that's uh

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,520
unfortunately gonna be changing because

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,919
for sponsors we have heather luna

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,559
then she was taking care of all that and

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:50,080
she's stepping down for the next year

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,520
and that just i think that just speaks

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,760
about how

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,960
we are i think at this point we're a

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,600
very well

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,440
oil machine that can probably

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,240
practically get the conference on by

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,600
itself

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,760
with a lot of help from from the

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,480
community but but i think we all pitch

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:11,840
in a little

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:11,840
and it can be done very well

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,400
