i'm a staff engineer at martian and i've

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,720
been the

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:24,000
last year in 2019 i was

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,680
i guess a co-chair withdrew very much in

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,080
the background of the year before i was

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,080
the chair

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,840
yeah and andrew winston i've been

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,239
working various python jobs for years

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,440
now

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,559
um currently excuse me

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,920
um so in 2019 as robert said i was going

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,440
to share with him and i will be

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,039
doing the same role again 2020 um this

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,879
will be my fourth day of con this year

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,360
so i've been an attendee speaker

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,000
now organizer yeah my first genuine con

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,840
was

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,640
the philly one i think it's 2016.

00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,359
might be 2015. that sounds right um my

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,199
first was

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,199
17 in spokane

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,479
so can you guys talk about about like

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,360
the name opportunity grants i mean

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,400
versus

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,960
versus just uh just like financial aid

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,920
and

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,600
where does it come from and all that i

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,640
like you take that one correct

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,880
through because you know what sure so

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,119
you know fighting financial aid becomes

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,960
yours images of lengthy applications

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,439
back from you know having to apply to

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,000
college and u.s and things like that

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,479
and we wanted to kind of fall in with

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
more

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,880
the uh with some of the more progressive

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,479
conferences that we like to follow like

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,799
i think we got the name opportunity from

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,799
jacob

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,680
because it um kind of conveys more of a

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,439
it's an opportunity rather than just

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,799
us just you know helping you is for it's

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,399
about you getting the money

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,840
and being able to attend the conference

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,399
rather than just

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,600
you know some lengthy bureaucraticness

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,840
how much is

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,520
is there a specific amount of money

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,000
reserved for that every year

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,160
or it depends on how many how many

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,319
people are asking for it or

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,840
uh definitely allocates a set percentage

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,239
of the budget each year

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,920
um it depends on the how much money that

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,879
is able to break in from sponsorships

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,120
and um

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,480
donations and things like that i think

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,520
our budget last year was around twenty

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,720
thousand dollars

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,560
for 2019. yep and we also um

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,480
apply for grants from other

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,319
organizations that we partner with

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,000
uh and they allocate to that budget

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,280
yeah those uh the agenda software

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,720
foundation and the python software

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,440
foundation chipped in last year for

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,560
example

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,760
what are usually the type of person

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,879
that applies for these grants or

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,959
i mean is it different the

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,640
type of people that have been applying

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,599
for this one versus

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,080
the type of attendees that you guys will

00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,280
like

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,200
to get to apply for these grants

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,000
i can't really answer that question

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,519
because one of the things we

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,560
intentionally don't gather

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,879
is demographics

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,680
so one of the things that we don't want

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,879
people to think

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,200
is plays into it as if there's any kind

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,000
of

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,120
bias in the way that the funds get

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,760
granted

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,720
it should be uh mainly uh on the the

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,680
scripted text

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,159
on what they say they're asking for

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,879
because

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:33,040
as nasa operates as intends to operate

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:35,280
the uh many times people just

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,959
ask for that provide very little

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,799
description

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,879
whatsoever and we have the way that

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,120
description against what other surgeons

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,799
are

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,319
what their situation is what their need

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,519
is um

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:51,440
and we don't need uh

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,440
any other bias applied to us

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,519
absolutely agreed yeah we um yeah as you

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,040
said we don't uh collect

00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,799
our graphics for that reason we just

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,959
like to people to express themselves

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,680
this is why we want to come to jenga con

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,640
this is what i hope to learn from it and

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,560
this is

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,760
what makes this is why i want to be here

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,120
you know it's about it's about the

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,080
attendee not so much whether they're

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,439
checking out boxes

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:17,040
one of the things i will add

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,919
to that is i think it's like a related

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,519
question sometimes

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:23,120
people uh thinking that if they're

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,160
coming internationally

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,280
um or if they're coming from some other

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,560
country that

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:34,320
that will be like a negative effect

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,600
to the application it's uh

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,360
the uh the

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,720
the ask itself the thing that gets

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,120
weighted the most more than anything

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,400
else is explaining why on earth they

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,280
want to come

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,040
like you know what what is that are they

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,560
been using django are they brand new to

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,320
django

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,680
how are they related to us are they not

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,360
related all to us

00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,720
they just tell tell a story about

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,440
what what their situation is um

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,720
because many occasions there's it's

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,639
mostly just

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,960
just a handful of words like i would

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,720
like to comment the first time

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,320
and that we have to weigh that against

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,440
someone else who's saying

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,639
uh i can barely afford to pay rent but

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,199
i really want to come and that person is

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,080
coming

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,240
uh you know from a distance inside the

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,280
u.s it makes it equal cost of someone

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,360
coming from

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:31,199
somewhere in central america right so

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,479
yeah like for flights to the west coast

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,000
of the united states supply from east

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,600
coast to the us is not that different

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,080
from what you said central america the

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,400
costs are roughly the same that regard

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,120
so yeah it's you know so nothing that

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,199
tends to

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,240
um or that was really kind of plus in

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,320
their applications

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,840
and being involved in local communities

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,880
like if they are active in

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,039
their local python group group

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,800
or they you know they want to take that

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,919
knowledge

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,600
that they have locally that helps to

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,360
help spread the word about gendercon and

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,720
what we do

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,639
and the knowledge that they gain

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,039
hopefully so that's that's

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,759
uh that's actually a really good point

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,120
of view

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,360
uh because i i wanted i wanted to see

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,800
if there was like maybe one or two

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,880
questions that you guys think

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,680
about any attendee like if if anybody

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,240
answer yes to to one or two questions

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,720
then

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,400
then they will say something like okay i

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,759
i should apply for a

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:33,039
for a uh an opportunity rant right like

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:37,280
how how do i know as an attendee that

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,280
that i should apply forward right

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,759
for me i would say if you think you need

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,199
help going

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,120
say you're not sure if your company will

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,639
pay for you to go if you're saying

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,639
you can get funding from outside like

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,680
from your job and things like that take

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,840
that of course

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,360
but if you need help for whatever reason

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,360
go ahead and apply the worst thing that

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,680
happens is we can't find room for you to

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,680
budget

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,039
so and what about the the uh the

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,720
application itself like

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:10,000
what are you guys i mean uh feel free to

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,800
talk as much in that about this as

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,160
you like or if you just wanna brush the

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,840
surface that's okay

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,759
uh but like what are the different

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,880
things that you take into consideration

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,880
like because

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,000
i i mean i i guess that it's very

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,639
difficult to wait

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
like one application versus another

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,319
because there's no

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,880
it's not comparing apples versus happens

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,400
right it's just like

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,400
widely different contexts

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:41,120
yeah very much so um for me uh

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,560
like i'd like to see that they've shown

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,759
some effort in terms of looking at what

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,520
their costs will be

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,360
you know just like doing some cursory

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,039
google flight searches or whatever

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,560
travel agent you like to use

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,080
so you have a rough idea of how much the

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,000
price would cost rather than just saying

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,840
i want two thousand dollars saying

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,759
it would cost like to be about this much

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,400
so it tells me about this much

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,440
and then and so forth for whatever cost

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,360
they may have

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,479
that that way they can that they should

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,240
they've made an effort to

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,680
show that they want to come and they

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,319
should do not just learn the asking for

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,240
money

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:15,360
i'd say that's probably a good way

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,319
of like bringing it another way of

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,319
adding is that

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,599
no promises going forward on methods

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,800
used but

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:30,080
in the past if you only need a hot

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,880
uh 100 bucks

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,440
right that's just a funny ass but yes

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,320
yeah

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,120
it's if you have if you have a small

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,159
very small

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,760
ass right if you can

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,760
the smaller asks do tend to get a

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,080
slightly better weight because we can

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,560
fit

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,200
more than that and our goal is to make

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,959
as many people attend as possible

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,320
so once we have i think this might be

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,480
appropriate to talk to this

00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,680
we go through a blind review round where

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,800
we just rate the

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,200
uh the merit of each task and we have

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,240
some

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,120
people who uh rate the

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,360
they ask itself and then presently we

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,040
just take the highest score first and

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,839
just begin allocating until we run out

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,760
of budget

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,200
and then we start having hard choices of

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,360
like this person's

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,600
asking for three thousand dollars that

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,839
is more than ten percent of the

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,240
but there are three people below this

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,240
person

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,360
and we can get all those people in if

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,240
you just de-allocate the other person

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,440
we have this that's where the hard part

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,160
hits

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,760
uh and so we have to make choices about

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,720
what we want to do and sometimes we

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,680
begin

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,000
um playing with other things like uh

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,440
what

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,360
i think it was two years ago

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,200
two years ago where we introduced some

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,160
caps for the first time

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,240
in certain categories and we had carried

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,440
this forward to 2019 as well

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:03,519
yeah and those caps were a way for us to

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,839
try to make the uh to give out to people

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,640
the same amount for a similar thing as

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,680
to say

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,519
if you have a room that you're attending

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,519
you know that you're going to stay in

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,839
and you you're asking for

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:19,839
the uh hotel room payment that we

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
capitalized

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,839
caps on those things as well so that we

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,959
could uh

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,800
limit those things down um

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,000
one of the things that we have found

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,160
over time

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,040
to sound like i'm going to go back and

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,040
like

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,040
uh remake on

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,160
i would say offended category is the

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,360
people who just want to

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,040
retake it they're like i don't worry

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,760
i'll come down there and i'll stay with

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,399
some friends

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,920
and i just want to take it and they're

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,480
you know from the area

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,200
and then because they don't view the

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,959
ticket as

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,519
value for some reason or another

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,880
uh even though it does overall decrease

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,079
the budget we can allocate

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,560
money that we have reserved the budget

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,320
that we have to pay ourselves back and

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,519
forth one way or another or

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,600
paying for someone's ticket um

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,480
though that's like i seem to remember at

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,560
least in

00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,880
2018 as so many

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,639
unclaimed tickets that was a large

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,920
quantity of dollars

00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,839
related to that and i don't know that

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,279
it's true same thing last year

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,639
we did not have as many last year i

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,360
think we we also did not did not have as

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,160
many

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,680
grants as the 2018 i believe but it was

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,279
a small amount i think like three or

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,160
four maybe single tickets that were left

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,000
unclaimed

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,240
okay something instead of a pretty small

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,200
number yeah i think it was a dozen or so

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,560
the previous year

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:22,160
so um but yeah so

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,399
uh we have to knowing

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,240
uh also the nature of making small

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,600
grants is something else that also plays

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,760
into this of

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,680
if we give a two smaller grant that we

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,480
may actually will have a lot of people

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,440
who

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,639
uh claim it say yes i will take that

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,480
take that money

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,000
when we give them the graphical claim

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,680
the grant and then just no

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,399
show yeah um at conference and we

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,680
are left with a bank of funds that we

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,399
could have actually

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,480
given someone else she won't come

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,760
usually when there is online tickets

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,399
those come from uh from grants

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,880
uh these well some people can request

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,120
money

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,040
just to him request but you can arrest

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,480
money in your request tickets

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,320
so you could request you know i just

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,600
need tickets i can get my own way there

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,560
or i live locally and i just want to

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,320
take it

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,000
or you can request just money for

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,760
example they're saying

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,440
i'm speaking but i need some extra money

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,519
to help cover travel costs

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,800
or i can or i can pay part of my way but

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,720
i can't fail my way i just need some

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,839
extra money or we actually had one

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,160
person last year

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,839
who um just wanted some extra money to

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,600
help cover the costs of transporting her

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,680
service animal over

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,639
but for the extra accessibility which

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,560
was great

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,959
uh unfortunately circuit spoke out

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,959
worked out

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,639
so these are the different um like

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,800
categories

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,120
that you were talking about that you

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,959
have and these categories

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,040
is it something like when you submit a

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,199
grant you have

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,199
to choose which category are you

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,120
submitting the grant for or is this

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,320
categorization something that you guys

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,480
do whenever you're

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:13,600
going through all the the requests

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,839
in 2000 we're here

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,959
i mean from i think it goes back to

00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:24,399
2017 um as far as i remember there's a

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:28,320
two-step question of uh do you

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:31,839
need only a ticket and if you ask

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,839
answer yes

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:50,399
um if you don't break down we will

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,320
tend to be um less able to

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,920
understand what the request is for

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,720
actually and it makes a little more

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,240
difficult

00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:01,040
so getting that breakdown um

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,399
so those are the way that we basically

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,399
categorize it

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,000
for us is we ask the people to

00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,560
self-categorize

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,560
three steps

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,959
yeah and one thing we'll um try to do

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,000
this year as well and hopefully

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,040
make things a little bit clearer is

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,240
there some confusion last year about

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,240
ticket whether we're talking about a

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,600
conference ticket or a plane ticket

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,720
and so we're going to be that you should

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,480
clarify the wording a little bit to

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,480
clarify that those are applicable

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,160
talking about the the application that

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,519
somebody's going to fill out

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,120
um i mean with this information it's

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,320
probably also a good idea

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,320
for uh as whoever was saying like for

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,600
for everybody who's who's filling out

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,040
the

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,920
the uh the application to uh detail

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,079
exactly what is it that well that's

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,800
that's one thing that is not 100 clear

00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,519
to me like

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,040
should they detail exactly what is it

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,839
that they need the grant for

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,199
or should they detail exactly what is it

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,399
that they're gonna

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,759
uh like spend some money uh throughout

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,480
the entire trip

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,040
regardless if it's for the i mean from

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,759
the grant

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,040
or not and then at the end of it say

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,320
this is why

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,120
i need like uh i don't know 500 which is

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,279
going to be

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:28,079
about 10 of my or my actual expenses

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:30,800
i think um the way we have the form set

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,320
up is that it's pretty much okay

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,079
like give us a total amount and then

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,120
please try to break it down for flights

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,240
versus hotel

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,480
versus transportation other

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,240
transportation et cetera so yeah

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,680
so kind of give us a big number and then

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,959
break it up into pieces as

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,920
you can best tell so say your ass is

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,720
700 bucks so say that's 400 for flights

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,959
you do what i'm

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,959
going to

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,959
may

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,280
that is the only

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,559
and by the way one of the things that i

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,720
should also

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,839
add here to everything else is that is

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,960
one question

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,000
our entire form including the checking

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,960
the box that you

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,960
understand you have

00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,930
[Music]

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,880
is ten fields

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,559
so i think we're going to add one more

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,080
field to it this year just uh asking

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,400
what airport you're going to be coming

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,520
from

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,840
to make uh to make it easier to identify

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,720
the

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,440
travel costs yeah so one of the main

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,400
things

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,520
again to like re-emphasize we don't ask

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,640
lots of information

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,880
unnecessarily because the past

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,840
some forms are longer and we're trying

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,640
to be very much

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,640
not bureaucratic not detailed

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,039
they might just

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,320
it's still i mean i think that's a good

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,960
idea but also

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:52,240
uh you guys are are kind of like uh

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,000
leaving things open so whoever is

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,520
writing these grants they can add

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,400
anything else right because there's no

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,400
question about

00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,679
okay tell us exactly what are you going

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,679
to spend this money

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:06,400
uh on but also they could add like

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,679
the uh maybe an explanation on their

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,000
other context right

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:14,720
like why is their specific case

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,559
uh unique and stuff like that yeah we

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,840
have a separate question about to tell

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,000
you a little bit about yourself and why

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:24,160
you'd like to kind of for that

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,240
sort of thing that's a point of that

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,720
and one of the reasons why we don't give

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:32,240
nice fine great breakdowns of you know

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:35,520
hotel and travel

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,840
and other fields is because in the case

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,039
of

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:42,799
services we

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:44,160
yeah i am it's just something that had

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,960
not come up before

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,960
as a as an ask for someone to have and

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,880
rather than us

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,360
shall i say um uh un

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,640
unfriendly with our limiting of our

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,200
choices down

00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,840
and preemptively and also moderately

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,000
prompting

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,960
people to tell them to go ahead and find

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,640
the things that they

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,640
maybe are fine with you know

00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:24,240
open-ended ass allows for us

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,799
to do the judgment on the backing

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,799
themselves

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,960
so i think there's one more question

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,120
about about the actual

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:37,679
filling out the grants uh itself

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,240
is there like well i mean we went

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,039
through

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,960
the different questions that or like the

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:46,400
main ones the the main questions that

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:49,200
the uh the form has and like how

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,200
people should or more or less fill out

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,880
the uh the breakdown of what is it that

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,520
they're gonna spend it on and a little

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,320
bit about

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,600
why they're gonna come to djangocon or

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,120
they want to

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:04,880
um so what about your personal takes

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,880
on what's the most important import

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,200
piece of information on those grants or

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,840
or like uh i mean this can probably come

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,960
from

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,760
whenever you see uh some of these forms

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,080
come through

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,280
and you read them and you go like well

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,799
we can't even take this one into

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,679
consideration because it's missing this

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,120
or that

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,280
or like we're like what's what's the

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,320
best way to fill out these

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,320
these uh requests

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,120
for me personally the thing i like to

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,720
pay attention to more than anything else

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,280
is be telling me about yourself and what

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,640
you can

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,080
and uh who you are why you why you like

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,960
to go to jail

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,480
if you can't you know tell us why this

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,880
is not just some other tech conference

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,880
to go to

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,039
yeah i wouldn't agree with what drew

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,240
said um that's the

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,640
most important thing um because that's

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,440
the

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,520
the main thing that we judge the entire

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,440
um

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,960
if you ask for a relatively modest song

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,679
but don't ask that thing

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,679
you'll roundly you'll be related

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,679
you'll be very lowly rated as an

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:27,840
application just

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,840
if you're almost not even answered

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,919
well that's good uh and also i think

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,360
uh this kind of answers another question

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,240
because i've seen on twitter

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,960
there's a lot of people that they are

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,840
hesitant

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,400
on on applying for these type of grants

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,960
i mean being

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,120
djangocon or maybe other conferences too

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,320
because they go like i don't know

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,320
it's not like uh i'm

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,600
in bankruptcy on earth or anything like

00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,600
that should i

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,640
actually apply for these but i mean this

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,120
is this this should

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,320
she would always be open to anyone right

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,440
even if they're

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,400
somebody that that's gonna talk on the

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,039
conference

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,000
and they've already gotten a free ticket

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,960
quote-unquote

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,440
because they're talking on the

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:19,520
conference i mean it's still okay for

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:22,559
them to submit one of these grants right

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,760
yep i mean i think since we

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,280
do one point in time you know we do show

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,240
the name of the person

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:37,840
with with the grant as objection just so

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:37,840
in case bill gates applies

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,320
mean yeah last year was the first year

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,240
we were able to offer speaker travel

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,000
reimbursement separate from the actual

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,159
opportunity grants process

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,640
but even then we still have a few i want

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,320
to say about four people give or take

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,760
that actually received additional

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,760
options on top of

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,960
your travel reimbursements that uh so

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,480
yeah if you're speaking go ahead and

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,039
apply by all means

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,120
and if you're um you know if you're even

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:16,480
a couple organizers

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:19,520
as well yeah

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,880
that's true and i think so i don't know

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,159
if this information has been shared

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,279
before but i wouldn't

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:28,720
pull it back up again to get the idea of

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:32,400
what the ask five people tend to ask for

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:37,279
uh we had i believe

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:41,840
um the most someone asked for last year

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:43,919
dollar wise was six thousand dollars

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,039
yeah that was a fun one yeah the beliefs

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,720
that someone asked for

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:52,880
was a hundred dollars uh but most people

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:56,240
uh on average of our set of uh eighty

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,240
eighty uh

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:04,480
we had um

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:08,240
with that six thousand numbers

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:15,840
everything happened 14.93

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:15,840
so i'm sure i could go look at the model

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,819
[Music]

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,240
yeah i think that gave us a pretty good

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,480
overview of

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,679
the amounts which is also very

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,640
interesting

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,039
so uh so okay let's let's see we've gone

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,919
through

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,039
more or less like how you guys start uh

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,559
categorizing

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:40,480
these these different uh applications

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,000
and then and then well i mean there's

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,400
there's still a lot of

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,159
things to take into consideration but

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,279
it's a good thing that

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:51,440
we we've been able to talk about exactly

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,120
like the the most important parts of the

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,159
application for you

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,600
um and and then like what are the

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,080
different things that people

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,760
should or how should they fill out the

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,039
entire application

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,360
so what about how exactly does it work

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:09,039
like once okay i've submitted my my

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,000
application my grant application

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:14,000
i got it i got an email back saying like

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,360
cool you're gonna get this money

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:22,240
um now how how am i gonna get that money

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,200
and and there's there's an interesting

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,880
thing that robert

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,240
just mentioned a little bit right now

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,679
which is about the whole

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,760
irs uh topic of it right so there's

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,720
i mean if there's any international

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,840
people

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,880
usually we don't know a lot about

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,799
irs or what that is right so and

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,440
and you guys have to take that that into

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,440
consideration

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,760
right right um yeah so the reimbursement

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,799
process is

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,559
trying to make it straightforward as

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,559
possible you just

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,919
the actual reimbursement process and

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,279
they'll actually come back and ask if

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,480
you have questions about your receipts

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,440
and things like that

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,960
they'll validate it against the

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,559
spreadsheet that has all the actions

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,520
that are related to the individuals and

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,679
all that

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,640
and then once they've uh then they'll

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,640
reverse you

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,080
most people if you can they'll reimburse

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,440
via paypal

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,720
but if internet if you're international

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,520
and paypal doesn't work there they'll

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,279
use uh

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,799
transferwise as a service to transfer

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,320
the money over that way

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:33,120
and then as far as the irs reporting

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:36,320
goes i believe that definitely

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:39,360
the irs as well yeah

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:42,640
and i want to say that we

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:45,039
correct me on the stream but

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,919
we have a primary process actually that

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:49,840
they can

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,840
do it in person

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:11,039
okay so let's see if i got this uh right

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,880
so then i submit my my grant and then i

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,760
uh i don't know let's say 500 bucks

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,799
right

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:20,159
uh and then it's like maybe

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:23,760
250 for uh for a flight and then

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,880
another 250 for the hotel and maybe some

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,080
meals

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,480
uh so then i get a yes from

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,760
from from the the conference organizers

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,360
you guys

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:37,679
and and then from then on my

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,679
what i have to do is is basically just

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,399
to to keep the receipts

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,600
and then after everything is done i will

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,159
send that to you

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,279
i mean even even if if maybe i spent

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,399
instead of uh

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:52,720
instead of 500 i spend like 600 uh

00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,600
you guys are going to reimburse the 500

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,399
bucks

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,399
and then i will end up spending 100.

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,840
that's fine as long as you know

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,880
yeah and

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,279
for the 2018 uh conference

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,520
uh take care of my travel and uh they

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,600
didn't get back to me in time before the

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,720
uh my grandma was actually awarded but

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,159
as soon as i found out i

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,399
know robert said hey my company's paying

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,320
my travel can i decline my award

00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:23,120
and then robert quickly uh went around

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:26,399
and found someone else

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,360
every year do you guys always spend like

00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,159
all the

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,200
the money allocated for the grants oh we

00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,520
try to

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,840
yeah we budget spending all of it but we

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,840
always end up coming just a little bit

00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,840
shorter

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:45,200
okay so and what about if for instance

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:47,919
uh maybe i submitted a grant uh

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,120
i it wasn't accepted but then at the end

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,000
of it

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,000
uh maybe there there were a few people

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,399
maybe one or two people that they

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,200
they declined the grant because as you

00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,519
were saying

00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,840
like maybe they were at the end of the

00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:05,840
day the company was paying for

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:08,880
their travel or whatever um is there

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,320
do you guys do something like okay we

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,679
have two or three people that they

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,080
declined the the grant

00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,039
is is there there's like open spaces

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,000
here i mean

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,399
do you do you go back to the people that

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,039
were

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,159
accepted were just pending or to do you

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,480
go back to

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,000
everyone who submitted it uh the way

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,240
that has been done recently is

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,039
since that score that i mentioned going

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,960
on list

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,080
and we just scroll down to the next set

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,360
of names

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,240
uh it makes it so that it makes it so

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,919
that we don't want to do

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,919
additional rounds of judgment right

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,120
we all together review the set all at

00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,120
once

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,399
could give last minute awards to like

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,559
for example with the service

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,080
animal example i used from last year she

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,760
didn't know she couldn't make it until

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:15,840
like two weeks before the conference

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:15,840
so we weren't able to um

00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,840
impossible

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,880
the receipts that people have to submit

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,960
is there anything off limits or is like

00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:59,679
anything that you get a receipt for

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,679
is okay i wouldn't say anything

00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,399
yeah we're not gonna yeah we're not

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,159
gonna reimburse you for going to san

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,159
diego for example

00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:13,360
so so yeah moving into into like

00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:16,399
international recipients uh of grants

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,000
how is is there like what are the main

00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:21,039
issues that you guys

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,600
have seen uh or what are like maybe

00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:25,200
a few things that you would like to say

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,600
to to any anybody

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,200
who's international and wants to apply

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,880
for a grant

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,440
i'm preemptively sorry for all the

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,440
travel bans

00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,559
yes same year yeah last year for example

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,760
we had one person who um

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,360
couldn't who was not going to make the

00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,720
conference because the usa department

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,559
literally gave him his visa for the

00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,760
wrong days

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:49,919
mid-conference and so he really could so

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,679
so for him to attend would actually be

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,919
here illegally so to speak

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,360
and so he would yeah so that would kind

00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,760
of kill his ability to make it there

00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,200
we felt terrible about that we went and

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,000
proactively reimbursed his

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,840
visa application fees and told him to go

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,360
ahead and apply this year as well

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,320
and actually some other friends

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,760
community are offered to help out with

00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,480
that as well which is quite nice

00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,960
for him for his case particularly but in

00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,280
general

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,520
yeah the earlier you can get started

00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,639
process the better off you'll be

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:21,280
and um if you happen to run into

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,399
troubles you know we have a visa process

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,399
that you're a visa help

00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:26,960
each letter that you can get from us um

00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,800
i've written emails

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,560
but don't quote me on that that you can

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:35,839
actually just email and ask hey

00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,839
can you help with the visa process

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,320
what are the main the main requests that

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,240
you that you guys have

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,440
seen there i mean because i would

00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:51,119
suspect that

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:54,159
maybe it's gonna be it's gonna be mainly

00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:57,359
about uh about flights

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,720
because flying into the the us

00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,880
it's a little bit more expensive

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,119
whenever you come from like another

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,320
country because if you fly i don't know

00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:08,000
let's say

00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:12,160
uh what like maybe

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:15,280
uh texas to to san diego

00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,160
it's like a 200 buck flight i think it's

00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,480
not too expensive

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,000
but if you fly like probably south

00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,440
america san diego

00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,280
i think it's probably gonna be like i

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,280
don't know 800 bucks something like that

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,880
yeah absolutely and that's probably the

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,119
reason why that's how we factor in the

00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,119
cost

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,839
alabama

00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,960
so what we'll do

00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:13,839
differences happening you know as always

00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,520
there's more and more things that we can

00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,560
see that you guys have to take into

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,599
consideration

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,880
like there is a bunch of research around

00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:36,079
each and every one of the

00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,240
of the applications that you guys get so

00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,760
when i mean it's it's probably better

00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,400
for everyone to just submit their

00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:46,079
application as soon as possible right

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,560
but um when when does it does this start

00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,680
or

00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,079
when is it too early to do it or too

00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,000
late

00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,200
to do it well i can tell you it's too

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,320
early right now because we haven't

00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,520
actually finished the forum for this

00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,200
year yet

00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,440
but um the form will go live about the

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,440
same time proposal goes live which

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,599
is last year's time period will be

00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,520
around the march april time frame

00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,680
and then it closes and i believe that

00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,680
yeah

00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,320
i don't know if there's anything that we

00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:25,359
missed that you guys would like to

00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,240
talk about maybe uh or just like mention

00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,359
something else

00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,520
i guess the last thing i'd like to say

00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,880
is that if you have any

00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,119
doubts whatsoever about what we should

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,880
apply go ahead and apply i mean

00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,400
please welcome notifications we

00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,680
encourage you to apply it

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:47,839
and if you have questions you can always

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:47,839
email us at um

00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,200
no that's good that's good ah well you

00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,240
know what i i

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:07,839
i have an idea also what about

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:12,000
future work do you guys uh have any

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:14,960
or or have like any to-do list for

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,160
these next few years or things that you

00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,800
would like to

00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,920
to improve or maybe change or just try

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,599
something new

00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,960
yeah is there anything like that i

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,720
personally would like to see

00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,079
more companies contributing to the

00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,160
opportunity funds so we can

00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,760
award some more people yeah the more

00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:33,839
play

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,839
of companies i think

00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,400
actually specifically contributed part

00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,920
of their sponsorship money to the

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,440
opportunity grants fund

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,800
and that helped award the grants to more

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,119
people that way i'd like to see more

00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,400
companies do that

00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,040
mine is slightly different um one of the

00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,520
things that

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,720
there is a good number of people who are

00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,440
coming to january

00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,400
are good at is great developers

00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,440
programmers

00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:03,040
software engineers um but

00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:06,640
uh the main tool by which we use

00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,599
the opportunity grants we have this tool

00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,880
that is

00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:14,880
called and the tool was made by

00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,880
andrew goblin and

00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,480
i think it um to be brought up so that

00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,440
it's a

00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,480
long-term support version that january

00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,040
supports

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,839
so if anyone goes out and searches a
