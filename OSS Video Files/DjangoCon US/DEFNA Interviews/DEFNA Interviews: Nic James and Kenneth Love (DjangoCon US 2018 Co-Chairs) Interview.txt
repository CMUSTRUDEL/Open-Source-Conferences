	00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:16,859
I am Nick James I started getting

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:18,570
involved with Django Khan in 2016 when I

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:23,009
first spoke at a conference it's my

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,960
first like full time talk and really

00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:28,140
likes the organizers so I asked how I

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,470
could help and then the next year I

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:35,149
became co-chair sprints and I enjoyed

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:37,649
that so I continued on to help with 2018

00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:40,289
2018 they mentioned wanting a co-chair

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:44,070
and I had a lot of time on my hands so I

00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:47,480
volunteered and that's how I became

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,480
co-chair Jinga though

00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:57,900
i'm kenneth love I got started with

00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:01,650
Django Khan in 2011 or so it's the first

00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:04,080
tech conference I ever attended much

00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:07,200
like Nick I then spoke I spoke the next

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,960
year in 2012 and then once it became a

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,860
community event I promised to help in

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,500
any way I could so I ended up doing

00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:20,340
tutorial selection one year I was on the

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,200
top committee I guess last year 2017 and

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,710
then this year they needed a chair

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,600
because the two previous chairs were

00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:31,140
burned out from it or not burn out bit

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,030
tired and so I stepped in to be a chair

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,450
and very quickly realized I wanted a

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:39,390
co-chair and Nick was amazing enough to

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,590
step up and help with that so that's how

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,520
you ended up with the two of us running

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,520
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:52,649
when I first got in into Django Khan it

00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:55,719
was back when it was being run by a

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:58,979
company not by the community so there

00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:01,420
wasn't as much like volunteer

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:05,140
opportunity or maybe there was and it

00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,850
just wasn't advertised as much once it

00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,039
became a community thing though I made

00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:12,190
it a point of I want to help out because

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:15,489
it's a really good event and it was

00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:18,790
basically just emailing a list I think

00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:22,030
and being like hey I want to help what

00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:24,220
can I do and they send you you know and

00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,470
invite to slack and mailing lists and

00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:29,860
kind of go well here's what we need help

00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:31,239
with come pick one and you kind of just

00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,700
pick the thing that you're interested in

00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:35,680
doing so long as they need help doing

00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,560
that so the getting involved part was

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,329
was pretty easy and then depending on

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,670
what you're doing it may that may be

00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:47,590
more or less work to do but the actual

00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:52,000
getting involved was was pretty easy in

00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:55,930
my opinion I would say that the giving

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,920
on all the lists was easy they once I

00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:02,380
was doing or like assigned to something

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,150
for lack of a better way to put it or

00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,819
the things I volunteered to getting

00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:10,810
people to answer the how to's was a

00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:14,260
little difficult so originally I started

00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:18,160
helping with sponsorship and that didn't

00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:22,359
go so well because there wasn't much in

00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,790
the way of how to's and whenever asked

00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:27,730
questions there were not so many that's

00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:30,630
changed dramatically but when I started

00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,630
that was the case

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:42,240
I enjoyed it a lot something that I

00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:46,500
really enjoy doing is what I call people

00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:48,090
shuffling which is basically organizing

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,040
things and setting things up so that

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:54,960
people can go and do what needs to be

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:57,180
done and so like well it took me two or

00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:03,650
three meetings to actually figure out

00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:06,450
how like Django Khan does their meetings

00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:09,270
getting the meetings all set up that was

00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:12,600
a lot of fun for me chasing people down

00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:16,530
for the agenda that that kind of thing

00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:20,489
but like and the actual event was a lot

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:25,800
of fun I would not like I would

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:29,400
volunteer to do it again yeah it's a

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,890
it's different being conference chair

00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,470
from my previous examples of being on

00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:38,340
talks committee or program committee or

00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:42,810
tutorial picking just because it's you

00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:47,280
have a lot less super well to find work

00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:49,950
like program committee you send out the

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,040
CFP you encourage people to submit talks

00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:55,560
you rate talks you figure out which

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,300
talks for the highest rated and you put

00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,930
them into a schedule and you're kind of

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:03,720
done I mean you have to deal with

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:08,100
contacting people or you know shuffling

00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:10,530
schedules but you don't have to there's

00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,890
no other major events as program

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:15,420
committee but as conference chair it's a

00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:17,730
whole lot of like little stuff

00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,890
throughout the planning and then the

00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:23,160
event gets there and you're kind of in

00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:25,800
the middle of everything so it's just a

00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:30,860
very different balance of where the work

00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:34,290
is it was fun to do that it's it's very

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,400
if you want to know like all the nuts

00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,260
and bolts of running a conference

00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,300
chairing a conference is a pretty good

00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,330
way to figure out all of those and learn

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:45,600
all of them outside of finances because

00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,830
with how the split is between deafness

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,509
and Django Khan

00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:52,199
the Django Con chairs don't really deal

00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:54,509
with money but other than that you're

00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:58,080
involved in you know talks and keynotes

00:05:54,509 --> 00:06:00,659
and schedule and running things from

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:05,340
room to room and just whatever else

00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:10,169
needs to get done as for doing it again

00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:15,120
I yeah I would I would do it again it's

00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:18,539
a bit stressful but at least it was for

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,639
me so that that weighs on my judgment of

00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:24,500
whether or not I'd do it again but it

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,500
was it was a really positive experience

00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:33,990
for me it was easier doing that as the

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,570
chair because for me it's easier to

00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:41,580
interact with people when I have a set

00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:44,850
goal and so by being the chair it's kind

00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,230
of for lack of a better way to put it

00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:48,270
and I kind of heard it phrase the soy a

00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:55,370
few times was the chairs are kind of the

00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:58,170
face of the conference and so I had a

00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:00,690
responsibility to be out there and we

00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:02,820
talking to people and moving around and

00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:05,760
solving problems and for me that's the

00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:09,390
best way to get me to talk to people so

00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:13,380
I didn't really feel any pressure or

00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:16,860
like this is the first conference I've

00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:18,900
gone to where I haven't felt problematic

00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,700
with the crowd you're kind of expected

00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,560
to go and talk to people like that's

00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,350
that's a big part of the role is to be

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,350
out there and be friendly and welcoming

00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:30,630
so I think that can help if you have

00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:35,160
maybe some social anxiety I think having

00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:39,330
that expectation and that power because

00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:41,220
you're in charge so it's okay for you to

00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:45,030
be out there and be talking to people I

00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:49,770
think that can help a lot and I

00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:54,120
I have very sporadic social anxiety on

00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:56,220
that kind of stuff so it's not too big

00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,800
of a deal for me like I rarely go hide

00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,750
in the corner of the room but there were

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,010
times where I was kind of like I'm gonna

00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,919
sit over here but then it's like no wait

00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:09,060
I'm sure I got to go talk to sponsors or

00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:12,710
find a speaker or something so it kind

00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,710
of had to happen anyway so

00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:28,620
so we start planning django con why six

00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:32,100
to nine months out so drengo con this

00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:34,979
year 2018 was in october we probably

00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:37,560
excuse me probably started doing the

00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:43,200
first like serious let's get organizers

00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:46,280
together meeting in Nick February March

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,320
maybe fury was the first meaning I

00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,420
volunteered to be chair around end of

00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,480
March beginning of April okay

00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,760
so yeah so six seven eight months out is

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,950
when we start like really planning this

00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,380
thing before that there's some work done

00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:03,510
by definite with you know money venues

00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:07,710
dates things like that but that's not

00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:09,960
the the organizers and the volunteers so

00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:13,110
the good thing is that for most of that

00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:17,310
the work is is very spread out will will

00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:20,240
meet and have conversations and and

00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:24,750
decisions being made in email slack or

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:28,320
you know hangouts for a couple of months

00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:30,750
before anything gets done visually which

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,440
usually that is we put out a call for

00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:36,660
papers the CFP and we put out a call for

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,550
financial aid applications so if you if

00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,770
you need money to attend you know please

00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:43,170
let us know and if you want to something

00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:47,280
to talk here's how you can do that that

00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:49,230
runs for a couple of months and at that

00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:56,250
point again everybody else is still some

00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:57,990
watts it's it's low amounts of stuff to

00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,370
do you know the the communications team

00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:04,230
is of course writing blog posts and

00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:06,120
tweets and all that stuff but it's those

00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,770
are oh is that monstrous team would

00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,700
probably be the other one that's kind of

00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,150
constantly going

00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:16,470
yeah sponsor sponsorship starts from the

00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:17,700
day Jango Connie and keeps going but

00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,560
again a lot of that in the beginning is

00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,860
just going to be emailing leads it's not

00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:27,290
necessarily coordinating any specific

00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:29,990
thing when we're

00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,610
six months out that starts to get more

00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:35,389
serious on sponsorship and everything

00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:37,399
usually by then well I say within like

00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:40,519
four months out CFP is over financial

00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:42,259
aids over so program and financial aid

00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:44,420
and visas have to start doing all of

00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:46,730
their work because they have to deal

00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:51,380
with you know getting letters written

00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:53,120
for visas or they have to you know tweak

00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,130
the schedule because oh the speaker has

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,720
to leave on the second day of the event

00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:00,649
so we have to make sure they speak on

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:03,589
the first day and and you know so on and

00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:05,060
so on and then you get down to a month

00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:06,949
or two out and that's when we start

00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:09,620
doing like okay we have to order all the

00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:13,040
swag and we have to start scheduling

00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:15,410
with the the sponsors to get their

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,209
shipments to the venue on time and we

00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:19,190
have to talk to the venue with like hey

00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:22,819
can you store these things somewhere

00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:24,889
that we can find them and so all of that

00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:30,470
kind of stuff picks up a month or two

00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:32,389
out and yeah that's kind of when I felt

00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,459
like Nick and I started getting more and

00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:36,019
more stuff we had to do was about a

00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:38,029
couple months out because they got to be

00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:39,290
the we've got to have all of our

00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:41,660
communication with the keynotes and

00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:45,829
we've got to step in to fill in all

00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:47,269
these you know little gaps that just

00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:49,339
have to get solved at that point

00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:51,380
basically whenever there wasn't another

00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:53,660
volunteer to do something it would be

00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:55,519
Kenneth or I who would do it at least

00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:59,329
for the chairs yeah it's a couple months

00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:02,120
out when our work really starts yeah and

00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:04,040
most of the actual work as a chair is

00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:07,100
during the week of the conference

00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:09,680
because you're you're there to make sure

00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,810
like you know nothing goes wrong if it's

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,990
at all humanly possible to keep it going

00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:17,180
so you're you're helping to make sure

00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:18,920
there's you know session chairs and

00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:21,769
you're helping to make sure that like

00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,509
vendor tables are set up and that's

00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:26,529
happen when and where they're supposed

00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,529
to and all that kind of stuff

00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:34,900
I think the biggest thing that I can

00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,630
remember being a problem and it wasn't

00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,190
super problem is one of our speakers got

00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:43,360
food poisoning the night before they

00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:46,720
spoke and so they wanted a chair thank

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,670
you and that that was a bit of finagling

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,110
goods we had to call the venue and then

00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,000
the venue had to call us and was like

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:57,430
well what size chair do you want and

00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:00,280
then minute and then they're like okay I

00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:02,170
tear and then they delivered a low chair

00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,990
and realized it was wrong they removed

00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:09,430
the chair and put a different chair it

00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:11,140
was but like I feel like that's

00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:16,390
something that would happen in a comedy

00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:17,890
sketch so I guess I guess again the

00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:20,980
labeling of food we had a couple of

00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:22,330
meals where we needed more food labels

00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:26,350
put out but I mean again that's just

00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:29,200
it's it's not a big thing right as far

00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:31,810
as it's it's an easily solved problem

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:35,050
you talk to the venue they bring out

00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:39,160
signs that say you know gluten or dairy

00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:41,440
or or whatever yeah and problem is

00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,710
solved I guess the other one was the

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,930
first morning of the main conference or

00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:51,100
the talk days we ran out of breakfast

00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:55,600
but that was because on the Sprint's day

00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:59,620
they had units and I'm very allergic to

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:03,460
peanuts they had like the venue removed

00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:05,620
it because like I can't have them in the

00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:08,680
room and so they fixed it four days

00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:12,280
after that and now they know not to do

00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:16,990
that again but that was also an

00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:18,339
interesting hurdle but we also had

00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,290
people who took care of a lot of this

00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:22,390
stuff for us we'd be like hey it's a

00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:25,210
problem kid and then someone would be

00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:28,589
like oh I got that yeah and out the door

00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:28,589
and it solved

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,129
definitely see kind of pulled us aside

00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:37,809
and did that yeah we had a couple of

00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:40,089
meetings with Jeff and Lacey where it

00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:42,069
was kind of like going over what the

00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:45,610
day-to-day of running the event was like

00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:47,319
and kind of like you know oh well here's

00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,389
what we do if there's a code of conduct

00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:51,339
violation or here's what we do if

00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:54,459
speaker doesn't show or here's what we

00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:56,319
do if you know some other random thing

00:14:54,459 --> 00:15:00,430
goes wrong that that's not outside of

00:14:56,319 --> 00:15:02,740
the realm of reasonable possibility I

00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:05,110
mean you could have crazy things like oh

00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:08,319
the venue burns down but okay we can't

00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:10,749
do anything about that that's not our we

00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:12,370
can't solve that problem but that

00:15:10,749 --> 00:15:14,139
speaker doesn't show up okay how do we

00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,180
how do we handle that you know we find

00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:17,589
someone else and where we try to shuffle

00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,470
because maybe the speaking would be here

00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:24,610
tomorrow or you know however however

00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:27,670
that worked out it's again it's it's

00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:30,670
amazingly handy having the previous

00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:36,009
organizers there to answer questions and

00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:38,649
bring up things that could go wrong yeah

00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:40,300
so like because they were there and we

00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:44,740
could like ask them basically on the

00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:47,379
drop of the dime like I didn't feel like

00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:50,589
I needed to know more beforehand

00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:52,240
however like at the same time I feel

00:15:50,589 --> 00:16:00,490
like I was finally getting a handle on

00:15:52,240 --> 00:16:02,920
things and it ended so it's like I kind

00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:04,929
of want to do it again just to see if I

00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,660
could do it better next year because I

00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:10,029
finally understand how things work but

00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:12,819
like that's that's not something that

00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:14,620
like you I mean that's something you

00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:19,329
kind of know beforehand going in it's

00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:20,980
like I guess it's kind of like a musical

00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:22,839
performance so you go out there and you

00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,339
play it and then you want to play it

00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:26,610
again because the next time you can play

00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:26,610
it better

00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:36,930
don't stop poking at people until they

00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:40,980
give you something to do yeah if you

00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:44,570
want to help out with events lots of

00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:47,190
times there are a lot of really good

00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:49,050
intentions but sometimes it may be a

00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:51,240
little hard to actually get something to

00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:54,060
do so yeah if you can be persistent and

00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,190
asking for like a thing to do hey I

00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:58,200
really want to help with this you know

00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:01,620
who do I talk to you about that well

00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:03,480
meeting show up and then there's often

00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:09,959
things where people like hey I need X

00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:12,480
and volunteer to do it yeah yeah I mean

00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,670
a lot of these events we have very

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,280
specific roles for people but most

00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:18,900
people don't stay in just their role

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,410
like it's very rare that we'd have

00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:25,320
someone who was you know on the program

00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:27,900
committee or involved in sponsorship or

00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:30,030
whatever and they would refuse to do

00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:33,990
anything else like that would be really

00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:35,370
weird for us to have you know the our

00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,990
program committee was there and they

00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:39,660
were helping with AV and they were

00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:41,100
helping with speaker gifts and they were

00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,750
helping with running sessions and they

00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,190
were helping with you know all these

00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,110
different bits and pieces that weren't

00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,400
part of their responsibility they could

00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,520
have just attended and watched the

00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:53,010
conference and that would have been fine

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,600
but they're all really willing to jump

00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:56,790
in and do stuff and the more willing you

00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,100
are to just volunteer and helpless stuff

00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:01,280
the more you'll get to do at a

00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,280
conference

00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:10,830
I like the smaller conferences because

00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:14,460
as I said I have a bit of a problem with

00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:18,480
crowds so the smaller conferences are

00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:23,160
more comfortable for me but the larger

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:25,620
conferences have more people there for

00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,910
me to network with I really like

00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:31,500
building out my network and it's really

00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:36,299
it's really really starting to help with

00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:42,360
my job search as I start helping out

00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:44,460
more and more and so like the big

00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,250
conferences are good because my network

00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,480
gets giant but the smaller conferences

00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,880
are good because I'm able to have

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,350
smaller conversations with people that I

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,240
wouldn't really get to have the

00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:59,640
one-on-ones with at the larger

00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:01,799
conferences and so like at PI Tennessee

00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,080
last year I was talking with someone

00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:06,000
about starting a women's group in their

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,669
area where there isn't like a PI ladies

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,400
group yet and so it was like okay how

00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:14,160
can we get that started and I would not

00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:18,419
have talked to that I did not talk about

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,280
that at all it like PyCon so it's just

00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:23,760
kind of like regional you hear more

00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:25,919
about the regional problems and how

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:29,330
they're trying to fix it and you can

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:32,970
kind of help them along their way versus

00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:36,929
like big conferences the community is

00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:40,130
kind of a bit you don't quite hear as

00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:43,490
much about the like smaller things I

00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:46,350
would agree with basically all of that

00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:48,840
the big conferences are really really

00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:50,520
great for just I want to be drowned in a

00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:54,120
sea of people for a few days and just

00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:56,240
get to talk to everybody and the smaller

00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:00,330
conferences I find myself actually like

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:03,210
attending talks which is a weird thing

00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:05,309
for me if you know me I went to PyCon

00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:09,350
for like five years in a row before I

00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:11,280
ever attended a talk at PyCon so

00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,630
actually I've only had that backwards I

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,800
think I want to talk my first year and

00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:17,950
then I stopped going to talks after that

00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,659
but at the small conferences like

00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:22,059
the talks are really interesting because

00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:27,039
they're very not the big ones aren't but

00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:30,240
they're very tied into the the that

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:32,500
local community maybe go to PI Gotham

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,970
yeah it's a Python conference and

00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,130
there's talks about random bits of

00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,870
Python but because it's in New York City

00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:40,840
and there's a whole lot of data science

00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:43,059
and financial science in that city the

00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,159
talks tend to skew towards this more

00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:48,519
scientific side which is really

00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:51,519
interesting being in Portland where the

00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:56,230
talks are like about Django or social

00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:59,409
things or you know other aspects of the

00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:01,149
Python world so the the small

00:20:59,409 --> 00:21:07,649
conferences are really neat for getting

00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:07,649
a sense of that community's focuses

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,700
yeah I mean it's it's one of those

00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:19,659
things that I think sounds really scary

00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:22,029
being a conference organizer you know it

00:21:19,659 --> 00:21:25,240
sounds like you're gonna be responsible

00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:26,799
for some major thing and if you screw up

00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,960
then people are gonna have a horrible

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,850
time at this conference or you know

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,639
they're what we talks on day three or

00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:38,230
whatever and none of that's true like

00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:40,629
any any established conference there are

00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,889
so many people involved that are there

00:21:40,629 --> 00:21:44,409
to make sure that everything gets done

00:21:41,889 --> 00:21:46,090
everything goes off without a hitch

00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:47,620
they always need more help but you're

00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:49,330
not gonna be alone on any of those

00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,759
pieces especially at django con we

00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:54,899
always have so many people who know how

00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:57,100
to do odds and ends weird little jobs

00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:58,539
that if you have a question somebody

00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:01,539
that can answer that question for you

00:21:58,539 --> 00:22:03,309
and so you'll you'll get the help you

00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:07,840
need so if you want to come and help

00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:11,830
with you know running sprints or I don't

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,360
know being a conference chair that's

00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,799
fine we have we have people that will

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,590
help you and you'll be able to get it

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,620
done and you'll do an amazing job at it

00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:22,360
and it will be uniquely yours because

00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:25,659
you did it which is what makes it really

00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,490
cool I I feel like not that I don't

00:22:25,659 --> 00:22:28,899
think the 2018 Django Khan was way

00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:30,250
better or way worse than any other

00:22:28,899 --> 00:22:33,159
drengo cons but I think it was different

00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:35,470
because Nick and I organized it versus

00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:37,659
Lacey or Geoff organizing it or someone

00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:40,120
else that's you know not been a chair

00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:41,610
yet organizing it it's always gonna be a

00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,679
little different for every single chair

00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:46,779
or every single program committee or

00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:49,690
every single sponsorship chair like it's

00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:52,120
always gonna be different so come and

00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:55,029
help us and make it neat in a new way

00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:57,309
and and we'll help you if you need help

00:22:55,029 --> 00:23:00,480
don't worry about not knowing something

00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:05,470
because there's someone who will is

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,759
really good advice if you volunteer for

00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:08,320
something and you're having trouble

00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:10,179
getting a hold of someone that that's

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:17,129
when you start contacting the chairs and

00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:21,639
the chairs start poking people but like

00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:23,650
don't ever give up because someone

00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:27,220
didn't get back to you the first three

00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:29,590
four times keep going everyone who's

00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:32,140
organizing at least four community

00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:33,400
events they have a job they have family

00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:36,910
they have other things that they're

00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:42,400
doing as well so if they don't get back

00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:44,950
to you keep pushing until you get there

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,540
because you will and by the time or when

00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:48,550
you do get there you'll enjoy it that

00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:51,000
much more because you put so much effort

00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,000
