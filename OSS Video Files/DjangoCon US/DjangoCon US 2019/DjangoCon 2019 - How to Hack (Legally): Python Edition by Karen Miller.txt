00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,970
okay so like you said my name is Karen

00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,060
I'm an associate cyber security engineer

00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,920
I'm on the penetration testing team at

00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:28,789
the software engineering Institute at

00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,520
Carnegie Mellon University welcome to my

00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:33,800
presentation on how to hack legally with

00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,680
resources that are geared towards Python

00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,260
users and I'll also briefly talk about

00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:48,019
why these skills might be helpful for

00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:49,909
you as both Python and Django users so

00:00:48,019 --> 00:00:52,220
my main goal with this talk is to

00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:54,739
provide you with resources that will

00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,900
help you safely and ethically learn how

00:00:54,739 --> 00:01:01,070
to hack just so you don't end up in

00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:05,780
prison so yeah there is an emphasis on

00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:07,549
the legally part so first I'm going to

00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,290
go over some terms that you may or may

00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:12,020
not already be familiar with just so

00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:14,659
that we're all on the same page and then

00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,609
I'm going to dive into a web site that I

00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:19,060
created and some of the ethical hacking

00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:22,090
resources that you'll find listed there

00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:26,149
including training certifications

00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:28,130
challenges competitions tools vulnerable

00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:33,170
virtual machines and vulnerable web

00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:35,990
applications then I'm going to cover

00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:38,149
some best practices for avoiding damage

00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:40,130
to systems and avoiding legal

00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:42,950
consequences throughout your learning

00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,149
and your hacking experience you might

00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,829
have read the title of this talk and

00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:48,979
thought that I would be teaching you how

00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:50,570
to hack in 45 minutes and if you did I'm

00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:54,170
really sorry I don't think that's

00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:56,929
possible but by the end of this talk you

00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:58,490
should know where to start your ethical

00:01:56,929 --> 00:02:03,310
hacking journey and you should have

00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:03,310
plenty of resources to use along the way

00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:09,530
so first let's go through some terms a

00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:11,120
lot of the terms I'm going to go over

00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,520
can mean different things in different

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:18,290
contexts but I'm speaking specifically

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:20,269
in the offensive security context so

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,310
we'll start out with an easy one you all

00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:25,370
know this one right

00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,290
let's not kid ourselves a bug is a flaw

00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:32,600
in software systems that causes

00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:35,330
unintended behavior a vulnerability is a

00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,570
weakness which can be exploited and a

00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:40,400
vulnerability can be the result of a bug

00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:49,550
luckily Jango doesn't have any

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:54,680
vulnerabilities right it's flawless but

00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:57,590
really 70ish CVEs since 2009 isn't super

00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,350
terrible obviously it's not ideal

00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:03,200
by the way CVA stands for common

00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:04,670
vulnerabilities and exposures which

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,010
isn't something I'm going to really dive

00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:08,900
into today but I do owe you a quick

00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,460
explanation since I just showed you 68

00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:14,030
of them

00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:16,460
so basically CDE codes like the ones

00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,770
that you see on the screen are part of a

00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:21,890
database that's maintained by mitre

00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:24,590
which tracks and describes publicly

00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:27,500
known cyber security vulnerabilities and

00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:35,930
if you want to see a real list you

00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:38,540
should go and look up WordPress CDs I've

00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:42,590
used the word exploit already but an

00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:44,660
exploit is code or commands or actions

00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,960
that involve taking advantage of a

00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:52,790
vulnerability for example to harm or to

00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:55,550
access a system a proof of concept is a

00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:58,190
demonstration of an exploit to prove its

00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:01,370
feasibility the amount of completeness

00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:03,890
can vary so it could just be pseudo code

00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:07,150
that says theoretically if you follow

00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:10,100
these steps you should be able to

00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:12,470
exploit some vulnerability or it might

00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,630
be actual working code and maybe you

00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:20,600
have to adjust that code a little bit to

00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:23,060
make it work for you a pen test or

00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,400
penetration test is a simulated attack

00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,290
on systems for the purpose of

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,680
discovering and exploiting

00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:32,360
vulnerabilities in order to identify

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,830
weaknesses and offer corresponding

00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:38,070
guidance on how to better protect those

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:40,260
from real threats so if you're building

00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:42,840
a web application what are some

00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,580
vulnerabilities or some security

00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,310
misconfigurations that someone might

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:50,430
test for in order to make sure that your

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:58,110
application is hopefully secure and feel

00:04:50,430 --> 00:05:02,490
free to shout out any answers none all

00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:05,280
right so here are some attacks that a

00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:07,920
pen tester might try in order to access

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,950
sensitive information that's stored in a

00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:14,100
database or for example upload a

00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:16,050
malicious file to a server this could

00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,720
aid the pen tester in obtaining access

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:22,800
to the server or potentially other

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,990
resources then the pen tester can

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,720
provide a detailed report outlining

00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:29,580
those findings and what can be done to

00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:34,980
mitigate those vulnerabilities in the

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:37,020
web application so it's important that

00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,940
the pen tester find these things and

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,520
that the pen tester advised whoever

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,610
asked them to test that application on

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,020
how to mitigate those vulnerabilities

00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:50,490
before a malicious hacker comes along

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:52,170
and finds them first so a great resource

00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:55,050
for learning about web application

00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:56,610
security including some of these items

00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:00,600
up here if you're not already familiar

00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:02,700
with them is a wasp Borg and a wasp

00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,430
stands for open web application security

00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,210
project I'll talk a little bit more

00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:11,160
about that later

00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:13,650
a threat is anything that could

00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:17,820
potentially cause harm to a system or to

00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:20,160
systems whether intentional or not an

00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:23,040
example of a threat is a hacker and

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,780
while we have this picture up I just

00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,200
want to make you aware that when you're

00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:30,620
hacking you have to wear a black hoodie

00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:34,710
and you have to sit in a dark room and

00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:38,600
for some reason binary will be floating

00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:43,320
around you and it's really crazy but

00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:45,420
yeah risk is the amount of damage that

00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,049
could be done if a threat exploits of

00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,149
vulnerability

00:06:47,049 --> 00:06:51,639
so for example taking into consideration

00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:53,889
how much damage a hacker could do if

00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:56,169
they discovered a buffer overflow in a

00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:59,759
program and they exploited that buffer

00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:02,139
overflow to gain access to a system so

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,360
you might think about what data is on

00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:06,969
that system what would happen if that

00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,610
system was taken offline and what other

00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:12,610
systems or resources could the hacker or

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:18,039
maybe access if they were able to get

00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:20,379
into that particular system Red Team

00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:23,229
Blue Team refers to an exercise that

00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:26,709
involves one team the blue team trying

00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:28,689
to get into systems and sorry red team

00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:31,300
trying to get into systems and another

00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:33,789
team the blue team trying to defend

00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:38,439
those systems the key difference here

00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:40,899
being that there's a training element so

00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:43,089
instead of focusing on getting into the

00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:46,239
systems to identify weaknesses in those

00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:50,889
systems the red team is getting into the

00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:54,129
systems to identify weaknesses and the

00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:56,550
blue teams security operations for

00:07:54,129 --> 00:08:00,429
example their ability to detect prevent

00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:03,489
mitigate and hopefully they are

00:08:00,429 --> 00:08:07,889
ultimately providing valuable training

00:08:03,489 --> 00:08:07,889
and actionable data to the blue team a

00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:14,289
capture the flag competition or a CTF

00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:16,659
involves security or forensics related

00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:18,819
challenges a lot of times you'll see

00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:20,739
that these are set up like a Jeopardy

00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:23,610
board so the harder the challenge the

00:08:20,739 --> 00:08:23,610
more points you'll get

00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:30,309
now we're going to go through some

00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:35,409
resources that you can use to learn how

00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:39,009
to hack so I created this website it's

00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:41,559
called hack hub and I made it to compile

00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:44,980
lists of trusted resources that you can

00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:47,050
use to learn how to hack and I'm not

00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,000
paid in any way for anything that's on

00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:52,629
this website so there's no reason for me

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,420
to put anything sketchy on there I just

00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:58,179
wanted to provide easy access to ethical

00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,820
hacking training tools virtual machines

00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:02,430
exploits and

00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,880
other resources because I've found that

00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:07,710
throughout my own learning experience

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,300
sometimes it's difficult to hunt down

00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:12,330
and keep track of these things

00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,250
especially as a beginner when you're not

00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:21,210
sure where to start and you're not sure

00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:23,010
what sources are trustworthy I also want

00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,630
to emphasize that you absolutely

00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,450
shouldn't limit yourself to what's on

00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:30,180
this website because there are tons of

00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:32,100
resources out there that I haven't gone

00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:42,270
around adding or that I'm not even aware

00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:45,330
exists so if you look over here there is

00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:47,700
a contact form so that if you ever want

00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:49,620
to share some of your discoveries or if

00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:52,590
you have any comments feedback or

00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,450
questions please feel free to submit a

00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:59,280
message here and it will come directly

00:09:54,450 --> 00:10:05,190
to me and I will respond but this is

00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:07,350
HACC hub the safety page is an acrostic

00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:10,080
that goes over some guidelines I'm going

00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,580
to talk about later that you should keep

00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:16,560
in mind as you're learning how to hack

00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:19,200
and also as you are hacking on each of

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:24,030
these sections there are blurbs about

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,860
the categories so I highly encourage you

00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:27,420
to read those before you dive into some

00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:31,290
of these resources because it has some

00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:33,840
helpful information then you can go into

00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:37,590
the individual categories for actual

00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:40,520
links to the resources so I have

00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:44,040
certification courses courses that are

00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:46,320
associated with certifications some

00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:50,090
training resources a lot of these have

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:54,540
helpful guides walkthroughs tutorials or

00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:56,820
training there are challenges and

00:10:54,540 --> 00:11:00,330
wargames if you want to practice your

00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:02,610
skills in a controlled environment and

00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:05,340
potentially be competing with other

00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:07,800
people but it's not exactly a

00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:12,500
competition it's more of like ongoing

00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:15,240
scoreboard if you want

00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:18,690
to participate in an actual competition

00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:22,230
there are plenty of those here there's

00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:26,820
also a link I believe to a calendar

00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:30,810
somewhere that has a whole list of all

00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:32,880
the CTE CTFs and cyber defense

00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,829
competitions that are coming up and

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,390
since it's almost cybersecurity

00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:39,209
Awareness Month you might want to keep

00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:41,850
those on your radar because that's when

00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:43,290
a lot of these competitions run if you

00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,839
find that some of these links don't work

00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:49,230
it might be seasonal

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,200
for example Metasploit CTF I know is not

00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:57,240
going on right now so the link is broken

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:59,490
and then we have pen testing tools a lot

00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,589
of these are included in Kali Linux

00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:05,209
which is a Linux distribution and I'll

00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:05,209
talk a little bit more about in a minute

00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:11,790
vulnerable machines these are virtual

00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:14,149
machines that you can set up locally to

00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:16,350
practice your hacking skills on

00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:18,779
vulnerable web applications

00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:22,610
sam neill you can set them up locally

00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:22,610
and practice hacking them

00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:34,649
so that's hack hub all of the resources

00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:36,779
that I'm going to be talking about in a

00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:39,480
minute can be found on hack hub so

00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:43,230
before we go on please feel free to take

00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:45,390
a picture or save this URL or just join

00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:49,339
me in a brief moment of awkward silence

00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:49,339
while I wait for people to do that

00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:58,330
all right let's start with training

00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:00,310
there are a lot of free training

00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:02,280
resources so don't feel like you have to

00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:04,420
pay a lot of money to learn how to hack

00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:07,060
but that's not to say that you won't

00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,800
find valuable paid training it really

00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:11,650
just depends on what you want to learn

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,860
and what your budget is

00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:17,170
but for this talk I found three Python

00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,640
training courses that you might want to

00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,580
check out if you're interested in

00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:26,260
learning how to apply Python to security

00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:28,990
and networking the Python for security

00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:31,720
professionals course on cyber re is free

00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:34,150
it's designed for people with little to

00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,580
no Python coding experience so if you're

00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:40,000
new to coding it's a good course to

00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:42,490
check out to learn Python functions that

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,950
are relevant to pen testing and if

00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:47,440
you're a Python expert I think it could

00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,450
still be worth your time you might find

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,750
yourself bypassing a lot of the material

00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:55,300
but it could be a good exercise to get

00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:58,060
into the security scripting mindset or

00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:00,880
to review concepts that maybe you don't

00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:05,980
use a lot now but you might use more in

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:08,170
a security context hacker sploit has

00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:11,020
free training videos on Python for

00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:13,300
ethical hacking which is also listed as

00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:15,550
Python for penetration testing on their

00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:19,440
website for some reason a little bit

00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:22,870
confusing but this is a more advanced

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,550
it's more advanced than Sai Brer e the

00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:27,460
cyber course that I just mentioned and

00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:29,470
it will go over TCP functions and

00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:34,330
developing network scanners and

00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:37,420
developing port scanners and then this

00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:39,550
pentester academy course called python

00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,800
for pen testers requires you to either

00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:43,510
be subscribed

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:47,350
which I think costs thirty nine dollars

00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:49,390
a month for pentester academy but it

00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:53,140
also gets you access to other courses or

00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:56,770
you could pay $150 just to have full

00:14:53,140 --> 00:15:00,310
access to that one course this course

00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:03,580
covers a much broader range of topics

00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:05,350
from scripting and actual exploitation

00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:09,350
techniques

00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:10,970
attacking web applications so since we

00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,950
all have different levels experience and

00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,600
goals it can really be helpful to see

00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:17,390
what other people have said about these

00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,490
courses or other courses before you

00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:21,950
commit to it especially if it involves

00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:25,300
spending a lot of money so I encourage

00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:28,580
you to do the research before you

00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:36,440
purchase a course or spend a lot of time

00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:39,500
on it now I'm going to talk a little bit

00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,240
about certifications I didn't list these

00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,940
certifications because I think that you

00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,820
must have them I just selected some

00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:49,310
routes that are popular to demonstrate

00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:51,350
their flexibility but of course you

00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:53,240
might decide you know pursuing

00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:56,000
certifications isn't for me

00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:58,400
and that's fine it all depends on your

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,490
personal goals it depends on your

00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:03,710
employment goals so that being said you

00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:06,680
should consider what your employer

00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:11,360
values what your prospective employer

00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:15,200
values and it varies by organization so

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:19,340
in some cases maybe your employer will

00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:22,370
pay for these certifications or maybe

00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:24,470
they'll only pay for specific ones which

00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:27,710
would be great considering the price of

00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:31,850
some of these so these are all things

00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:35,150
that you should consider the first row

00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:37,640
is ec-council certifications which lead

00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:40,820
up to the license penetration tester or

00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:42,950
LPT certification that certification

00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,380
requires a lot more technical knowledge

00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:47,930
than the first in the series which you

00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:52,010
may have heard of the certified ethical

00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:54,830
hacker certification or ceh the CH is

00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:56,620
considered entry-level friendly for

00:16:54,830 --> 00:17:01,270
people who want to become familiar with

00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:01,270
security concepts and ethical hacking

00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:09,380
global information assurance

00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:11,030
certification or giac has various pen

00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:14,900
testing related certifications that are

00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:17,360
associated with sans courses the giac

00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:20,209
penetration tester or g-pen

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,189
is considered more mid-level because it

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:25,280
can be more challenging if you make use

00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:27,920
of the labs but since they the labs are

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,380
optional and since the exam is open book

00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,780
it's really about what you're willing to

00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:35,870
put into it and I hope if you're paying

00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:37,730
that much or someone is paying that much

00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:41,510
for you that you're willing to put a lot

00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:43,850
of time and effort into it and if you're

00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:46,070
interested in exploits and research you

00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:49,490
can eventually work your way up to the

00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:52,190
giac exploit researcher and advance

00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:54,890
penetration tester certification which

00:17:52,190 --> 00:18:00,140
thank goodness is shortened to GX Penn

00:17:54,890 --> 00:18:03,470
the last row includes some offensive

00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:05,090
security certifications these are highly

00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:08,240
regarded because of how technical the

00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:11,540
labs and the exams are the labs are

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,610
really wonderful and frustrating and

00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:16,220
you'll learn a great deal and you'll

00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:18,440
hear the phrase try harder over and over

00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:21,650
again which will probably annoy you to

00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:24,830
death but eventually when you overcome

00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:27,740
the trauma of the osep you might decide

00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:31,780
to pursue the web expert certification

00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:34,010
the OU SWE or if you want to focus on

00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:36,380
exploit development instead of web

00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:38,480
attacks then you might pursue the

00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:42,049
exploit exploitation expert

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,450
certification or the OSCE but like I

00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:47,750
said there's no right certification

00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:50,809
there's no right series for everyone for

00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:53,240
example you might prefer to go certified

00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:56,270
ethical hacker remember that's the more

00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:59,570
entry-level friendly certification and

00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:01,850
then the GIAC pentester which is a good

00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,500
mid-level certification and then the

00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,630
offensive security certified

00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:09,049
professional which might make you want

00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:14,120
to throw your keyboard at a wall but it

00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:16,250
will be worth it I promise or maybe you

00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,860
want to focus on web application pen

00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:21,620
testing in which case you might do the

00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:25,160
giac web application penetration tester

00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:28,940
the G web or the offensive security web

00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:30,050
expert osw e and those are worth looking

00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:33,170
into if that's

00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:35,330
interesting to you you should really

00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,980
take some time to evaluate which path is

00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:39,500
right for you if you're interested in

00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:41,090
pursuing certifications at all and sorry

00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,970
for throwing all of these annoying

00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:45,620
acronyms at you but I mean that's why

00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:48,380
they're on hack hub so that you can look

00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:53,120
into them a little bit more on your own

00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:54,830
time so like I said next month is

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,020
cybersecurity Awareness Month

00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:59,030
which means there will be a lot of

00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,700
competitions a lot of capture the flags

00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:03,980
happening and if you have time to

00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,560
participate in some of those you should

00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:08,300
do some research on which of those

00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:11,720
you're qualified for because some of

00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:14,090
them target a specific audience you

00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,830
should see if maybe there are some local

00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:18,590
competitions that you can participate in

00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:20,630
but if there aren't I know that there

00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:23,720
are a lot of remote competitions that

00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:25,370
you can participate in and oftentimes if

00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,750
you're at a security conference there

00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:29,330
will be a capture the flag that's

00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:31,670
ongoing and people there who are

00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:39,770
probably very happy to help you if you

00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:41,420
ever get stuck so competitions are very

00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:43,070
dear to me because they're what

00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:46,430
transitioned me from computer science

00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:49,520
into security and they really challenge

00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:54,860
you to think outside the box and apply

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:57,560
your skills to realistic scenarios but

00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:02,270
not always realistic scenarios are there

00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:03,350
any Doctor Who fans out there yeah all

00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:06,680
right

00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:08,960
so at one time I don't know anything

00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:11,690
about Doctor Who but one time I ended up

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,680
learning a Doctor Who language for a

00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,140
capture the flag

00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:18,700
I think it's called Gallifrey and but it

00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:22,270
might be pronouncing that wrong yeah

00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:24,950
but it was still a wonderful challenge

00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:27,800
because even though I ended up staring

00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,540
at this thing for a really long time and

00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,060
I was really frustrated and I didn't

00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:34,640
know what it was it pushed me to do

00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:36,920
extensive research and learn something

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,920
new and that's a really valuable skill

00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:43,640
to have as a hacker or a penetration

00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:46,140
tester or for anyone to have really

00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,210
so that's why you should try to

00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:55,320
participate in caption flags if you're

00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:57,000
interested in picot CTF is a capture the

00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,340
flag competition that's run by a

00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,230
Carnegie Mellon University and it's

00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:04,020
aimed at middle schoolers and high

00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:07,290
schoolers but the challenges are open

00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:09,960
year-round so if you're new to CTF this

00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:12,210
is a great way for you to get experience

00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:15,000
and get a feel for how the capture the

00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:17,400
flags are structured and since you can

00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,410
do it on your own time without anyone

00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:24,419
around you know there's no pressure and

00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:26,450
it's a great way to ease into capture

00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:30,809
the flags

00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:32,940
run code is an annual tournament which I

00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:35,340
believe is open to everyone regardless

00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:38,790
of whether you're in school or not or

00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:40,290
what your age is but similarly they also

00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:43,620
have challenges open year-round

00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:47,970
including operating system network

00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:50,220
security and other coding challenges so

00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:53,370
I encourage you to look at that one too

00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:56,220
and hack this site is a source of

00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:58,290
hacking challenges and they're broken

00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:00,350
down in categories so it's easy for you

00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:02,760
to figure out what you want to focus on

00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:09,120
like programming challenges for example

00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:13,049
and then you can easily do those pen

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:15,150
testing tools kali linux is a linux

00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:17,610
distribution that's used by pen testers

00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:22,230
and it includes an extensive collection

00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:25,320
of security and forensics tools so i I

00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:28,620
would start your pen testing tool

00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,600
exploration there because there's tons

00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:33,000
of them and you might find that some of

00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:37,860
them you never need but it's still good

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:41,400
to know what's available to you exploit

00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:45,230
DB is a database of exploits proofs of

00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:48,059
concept and other security resources and

00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:50,340
you can access the exploit database

00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:56,260
using a tool called search slate which

00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:59,200
comes with Kali Linux vulnerable machine

00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:02,530
in the form of virtual machines can be

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,870
set up as targets for you to practice

00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:06,880
your tools and techniques on and these

00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:10,240
can be set up on your own machine of

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,770
course or you know you obviously want to

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,840
keep them on your own property since

00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:17,049
they are vulnerable and you don't want

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,950
them to be public facing because then

00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:23,470
you're just opening a door for hackers

00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:26,260
so volna is a great source of vulnerable

00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:28,210
virtual machines and a lot of them have

00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:30,160
write-ups associated with them so that

00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:32,460
if you ever get stuck or if you just

00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:35,140
want to see how other people have

00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:38,340
exploited those machines then you can

00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:40,809
reference those and a lot of times

00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:44,080
there's a link in the description of the

00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:46,210
box when you go to download it but if

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:51,010
there isn't then you can probably find

00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:53,710
it just with a quick google search there

00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:55,780
are also a few Metasploit able boxes

00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:58,419
these are Linux virtual machines that

00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:00,880
are again intentionally vulnerable for

00:24:58,419 --> 00:25:03,309
the purpose of practicing your tools and

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,940
your exploits and they're called

00:25:03,309 --> 00:25:08,410
Metasploit able machines because of a

00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:11,770
tool called Metasploit and kali linux

00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:17,590
which you will discover very quickly if

00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:21,160
you decide to explore Kali but yeah

00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:22,660
again these can be hosted locally hack

00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,120
the box is a little bit different

00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:28,570
because it doesn't provide downloadable

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:32,470
virtual machines it's a lab environment

00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:34,600
that you VPN into with machines of

00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:37,600
various difficulty level for you to try

00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:41,860
to hack and they only allow write ups

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:45,190
for the retired boxes you have to have a

00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:48,220
subscription to access retired boxes but

00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:49,600
since they rotate boxes fairly often if

00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,130
you're ever wondering how you could have

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,780
exploited a box or if you're ever

00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:55,630
wondering how other people exploited a

00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:58,510
box you can just wait for that box to

00:25:55,630 --> 00:26:04,000
retire and then you can watch the

00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:07,299
write-ups start to pop up as a side note

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,850
I would encourage you to check out Apes

00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:17,269
X YouTube channel for a lot of really

00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:19,690
cero walkthroughs of retired boxes last

00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:23,240
we have vulnerable web applications

00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:25,730
there are tons of these and they're

00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:29,179
built in various languages and platforms

00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:31,009
and you can use them to practice things

00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:33,740
like cross site scripting sequel

00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:38,379
injection command injection a lot of

00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:41,299
those words that I showed you earlier if

00:26:38,379 --> 00:26:43,700
you find a web application exploit on

00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:46,309
exploit DB a lot of times they will

00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:48,350
provide you with a download link to a to

00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:51,409
the Associated vulnerable version of

00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:53,090
that web application if you want

00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:56,990
something a more realistic that's not

00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:58,159
intentionally vulnerable or since we're

00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,289
at a Django conference

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:03,679
you could try building your own mobile

00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:05,629
web application to practice on or you

00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:09,080
could collaborate with your wonderful

00:27:05,629 --> 00:27:11,269
peers and when you feel comfortable you

00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:14,629
can apply the skills that you win to

00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:17,360
your own web applications or the web

00:27:14,629 --> 00:27:19,610
applications that your peers develop in

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,710
a very controlled non production

00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:26,600
environment with necessary permissions

00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:28,879
of course and I mentioned a wast earlier

00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,490
it's a great source of all things web

00:27:28,879 --> 00:27:33,470
application security and they have their

00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:35,600
own list of intentionally vulnerable web

00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:42,129
applications including a lot that we're

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:45,230
built by people over it Oh bust okay so

00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:47,210
you shouldn't just learn how to hack you

00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:49,759
should learn how to hack ethically and

00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:52,970
you should also learn how to ethically

00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:54,919
learn how to hack so this is the part

00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:58,519
where I tell you how to hopefully avoid

00:27:54,919 --> 00:28:03,320
going to prison with this acrostic that

00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:06,080
I made be a trusted hacker and being a

00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,999
trusted hacker means that you take your

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,159
time when you're learning and when

00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:12,110
you're hacking because there are a lot

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,610
of important concepts that you really

00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:16,940
need to understand really need to

00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:20,299
consider to avoid damaging a system or

00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:23,509
to avoid facing legal consequences so be

00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:23,960
patient and be curious but don't be

00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:28,430
impulse

00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:29,930
this here are a few reasons why these

00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:33,170
are three commands that you could

00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:35,540
accidentally execute the first one moves

00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:37,600
your directory of important data or your

00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:41,810
customers directory of important data

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:45,560
into a sort of black hole which isn't

00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:47,810
good the second one forces the recursive

00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:52,760
removal of all files below the root

00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:55,870
directory and the third command wipes a

00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:59,030
file that you maybe didn't mean to wipe

00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:02,200
so I know it's easy to sit here and

00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:05,480
think I would never be that dumb

00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:07,550
actually no an intelligent person who

00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,980
accidentally executed that second

00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:14,120
command and it wasn't me even though I

00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:18,550
know you're all thinking it was her but

00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:20,420
no he was joking one day about

00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:22,490
accidentally deleting all his files

00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:24,740
can't remember the context and then a

00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:26,870
couple days later he admitted that he

00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:33,680
did execute that command and deleted all

00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:35,540
of his files um next you want to refrain

00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:38,570
from touching systems that you don't own

00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:40,880
unless you have a legal agreement which

00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:44,000
permits you to so set up your own

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,010
environment or use one that's explicitly

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,290
designed for you to practice your

00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:52,190
techniques like some of the resources

00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:54,200
that I just discussed every state in

00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,940
every country has its own laws regarding

00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,340
hacking but I think that the general

00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:05,900
consensus is that hacking systems you

00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:08,420
don't own is not a good idea some of you

00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:10,820
might be familiar with this story but a

00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:12,800
fourteen-year-old played a prank on his

00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:16,400
teacher by logging into the teachers

00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:18,530
accounts and changing their wallpaper at

00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,360
the school teachers used really weak

00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:21,920
passwords they would type their

00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:25,340
passwords in right in front of their

00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:27,710
students they didn't really he didn't

00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:31,580
have to go to great lengths basically to

00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:34,100
get into this teacher's computer but

00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:35,540
there were state exam answers that he

00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,580
could have accessed when he logged in

00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:38,930
and potentially a significant

00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:41,480
amount of damage that he could have done

00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:44,660
even if that wasn't in his intention and

00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:48,730
even if that's not at all what he did so

00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:52,100
at age 14 he committed a felony and

00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:55,670
whatever age you all are committing a

00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:59,950
felony is much more serious than what it

00:30:55,670 --> 00:31:02,990
was for him so just keep that in mind

00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:05,570
use tools exploits and guides from

00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:08,420
trusted sources because there are

00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:10,400
malicious tools and exploits that are

00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:14,330
designed to compromised your system or

00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:17,420
even publicly humiliate you and they are

00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:21,890
falsely advertised to trick people more

00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:23,930
on that in about three slides segregate

00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:25,850
and segment appropriately to ensure

00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:27,830
important data and systems and

00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:30,080
especially systems that you don't own

00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:33,110
are separate and protected from your

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,360
test environment and why do you have a

00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:38,060
test environment so that you can test

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,610
exploits and tools in a safe space to

00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:43,240
make sure that they work as expected and

00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:45,980
make sure that you know how to use them

00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,320
this can really help you gain a further

00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:52,070
understanding of what an exploit or a

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,770
tool does and what artifacts they might

00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:57,020
generate because you don't want to

00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:59,330
accidentally leave files on your

00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:02,390
customer systems so that weeks later

00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:04,640
they come to you asking hey was this

00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:08,720
left by you or was it left by an actual

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:10,520
hacker who's after our data and if that

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,920
does happen you want to be able to say

00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:17,290
with total confidence yes that was me or

00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,290
no you should probably look into that

00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:24,770
exploit smartly not blindly understand

00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:28,790
how an exploit works understands what it

00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:30,830
does before you even try it modify it as

00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:33,740
needed to suit your purposes because

00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:36,050
it's not a one-size-fits-all type of

00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:39,020
situation if you're targeting a

00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:40,370
different operating system or even

00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,470
launching it from a different operating

00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:45,220
system than it's meant to then there's

00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:50,410
going to be some modification needed

00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:53,330
otherwise if you don't

00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:57,380
you know look into what actually does

00:32:53,330 --> 00:33:00,560
you might run into an open SSH open SSH

00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:03,340
exploit with this shellcode and if you

00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:06,170
don't reverse engineer this shellcode

00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:09,530
you might not realize that it executes

00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:13,720
this command which if you recall from

00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:13,720
earlier does delete all your files

00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:20,150
finally um they should go without saying

00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:22,790
but I'm going to say it anyway don't use

00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:25,370
your skills maliciously however tempting

00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:27,830
it might be just don't because it could

00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:30,800
cost you a lot of money in a lot of

00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:33,830
prison time and I'm not trying to scare

00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:35,690
you out of security I really am NOT I

00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:39,380
just think it's good to develop good

00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:41,150
habits early on when you if you're

00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:46,130
interested in pivoting into a security

00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:48,800
career or just learning more here's a

00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:51,830
quote from a man who did code a prison

00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:54,460
for hacking and who has since used his

00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:57,920
skills for a more ethical line of work

00:33:54,460 --> 00:34:00,590
he said my motivation for hacking was

00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,600
all about the intellectual challenge the

00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:07,130
seduction of adventure and most

00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:09,380
importantly the pursuit of knowledge the

00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:11,630
hacker ethic is you never try to make

00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:15,590
money from it and you never try to harm

00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:18,130
or destroy unfortunately as you all know

00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:21,679
that's not the case for a lot of hackers

00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:24,770
people quickly turned hacking into a

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,690
means of money and destruction and it's

00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:29,060
a huge issue that we hear about every

00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:31,220
day so if you're going to learn how to

00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:33,649
hack please learn for the right reasons

00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:37,790
because there are already so many people

00:34:33,649 --> 00:34:40,909
doing it for the wrong reasons if you're

00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:42,620
interested in reading more about these

00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:46,880
guidelines that I just went through in

00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:48,950
blog post form as of last week this post

00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:53,360
is published to the software engineering

00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:56,179
Institute's insider threat blog and it's

00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:59,480
super easy to find just google SEI blog

00:34:56,179 --> 00:35:02,180
or sei insights and look for the insider

00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,890
threat blog my post is really easy to

00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:05,630
spot because for some reason

00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:07,850
everyone else's headshots are like these

00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:10,100
professional headshots on a you know

00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:13,820
subtle background and mine is like

00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:17,260
outside with a leafy background so it

00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,260
really stands out it's weird

00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:23,420
I won't be taking questions now as my

00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:26,210
way of sort of making sure that you

00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:29,570
utilize the resources and contacts you

00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:31,550
discover at conferences and let's be

00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:33,800
real I also probably won't be able to

00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:35,120
give you as good of an answer standing

00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,510
in front of a bunch of people in a

00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:41,600
camera as I would if it was just

00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:44,540
one-on-one I could give you a more

00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:47,090
thoughtful response if you approach me

00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:50,900
in the hall or if you want you can email

00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:52,580
me you can contact me through Twitter my

00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,130
Instagram handle is up there if you're

00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:56,240
interested in urban photography but I

00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:59,800
guess you could ask questions on

00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:02,600
Instagram too if that's what you want

00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,230
thank you for your time and stay out of

00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:08,480
prison

00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:15,510
[Applause]
