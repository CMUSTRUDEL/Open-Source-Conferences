00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:20,570
so thanks for reading my first slide

00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:23,300
before we get dig into the actual talk

00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:26,000
talk I want to take up real scientific

00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:28,279
poll in the room and ask you if you are

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,449
and if you're completely satisfied at

00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:31,039
your current job and if you're in

00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:36,080
between jobs right now think of your

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:40,760
most recent job so again really really

00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:43,100
scientific right that's why yeah that's

00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,739
why I like we're with our co-workers and

00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:49,309
bosses so yeah not super scientific but

00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:50,750
I know you're happy to him so are you

00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:51,830
completely satisfied that was I like

00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:56,210
looked around the room that was maybe

00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:58,750
thirty percent of you so great there was

00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:02,600
a Gallup poll in 2018 so fairly recently

00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:05,030
that asked a number of questions to US

00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,950
workers and fewer than half of them were

00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:10,190
completely satisfied so I think that's

00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:12,200
kind of a sad number but that actually

00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:14,299
job satisfaction isn't what brings me

00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,640
here today isn't what made me into

00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:18,649
forming my own business but let me give

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,640
you a little background on me before I

00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:24,560
dig into I graduated college with a

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,659
degree in computer science and while I

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,859
was in college I was working as a web

00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:32,270
developer part-time since the year 2000

00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:34,520
then I transitioned and started working

00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:39,350
at a university for about 12 years

00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:41,329
university pensively I've at Wharton a

00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,880
few Wharton folks here that was a great

00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:47,030
job but I ended up moving then to North

00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:50,359
Carolina in 2015 to escape Philadelphia

00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:52,909
winters so my husband and I moved to

00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:55,999
North Carolina in 2015 and then I formed

00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:57,740
my business in 2017 so I moved to North

00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:59,299
Carolina took a job at cactus another

00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,090
company that's here and there another

00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:03,859
great company took a full-time position

00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:06,499
there before transitioning and becoming

00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:08,780
a contractor and working for myself some

00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:11,330
all that stuff on the right I'm none of

00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,069
those things on the left so while I'm

00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:15,170
not a lawyer and I'm not an accountant I

00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:17,900
work pretty closely with my accountant

00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:19,790
so everything I do on a day to day basis

00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,040
in fact I end up talking to him like

00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,340
maybe like sending him an email once a

00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,040
week so he loves me

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,319
sure but I just want to make sure that

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,349
the IRS is happy with me so everything

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,170
I'm talking about today has been legal

00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:36,150
for me and a lot of it has to do with US

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,950
entities for what it's worth but I have

00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:42,450
stuff that's kind of more universal as

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:44,550
well so this is an overall overview of

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,739
what I'll be talking about today how did

00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,150
I get here not here at Jango con but

00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:50,640
here like running away I'm in business

00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,590
for the past two plus years the

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,050
decision-making and the fear around that

00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:58,170
and how I addressed that then I'll get

00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,519
to the meat of the presentation or I'm

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,700
vegan so I like to call it the

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,500
plant-based meat alternative the which

00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,560
is that how to roll your own business so

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:10,019
the actual like the law stuff and the

00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,660
accounting stuff and all that stuff then

00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:15,780
I'll get to finding clients hopefully if

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,940
I don't run out of time which is like my

00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,769
most personal and my favorite part of

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,599
this talk I have a lot of stories there

00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:24,780
about how I've found clients in the past

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:28,260
two years and then I have some some free

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,579
materials to send you all off with can

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,609
somebody shout out where City this is

00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:34,500
taken yeah everybody yeah a lot of

00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:37,320
people know this is the Painted Ladies

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,690
in San Francisco so San Francisco

00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:45,000
figures heavily into my story of how I

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:50,400
ended up running my own show so in our

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,319
late 2016 my husband got a job offer and

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,079
it was too interesting to pass up we had

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,239
lived in North Carolina for two years

00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:58,950
and he had always dreamed of living in

00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,109
San Francisco and we were kind of like

00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,329
adventurous like we had moved to North

00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:05,370
Carolina and started a new life there

00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:08,130
and I was like look if this is the job

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,420
for you like let's like you did this for

00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,160
me let's let's take the next step let's

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,970
go to California so we decided we're

00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,019
gonna move to California um

00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:17,729
and I didn't really think too much about

00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,049
my job I was in the back of my mind I

00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:22,049
was like well I really like my job so

00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:23,970
maybe I can somehow keep it so we decide

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:25,200
to move to California to San Francisco

00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,810
and

00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:31,180
his job because it was in the school

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:33,220
system there would be in in the

00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,110
following summer so he had a long time

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:39,850
to kind of transition out there and in

00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:42,100
the spring of 2017 we went out and spent

00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,240
some time in San Francisco like gauging

00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,180
the neighborhoods and deciding where to

00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,980
live and we met up with a good friend of

00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,530
mine who had moved out there from

00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:53,320
Philadelphia for this like super

00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:55,840
high-profile job at a social super high

00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:59,110
profile so social media company out

00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,880
there and she had gotten a like moving

00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,310
package and a signing bonus I know

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,540
pretty sweet salary and and she was like

00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,190
Erin what are you doing you're moving

00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:09,610
out here and you're not even like

00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:11,140
looking at all these tech jobs and I

00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,530
thought about that for like 30 seconds

00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:16,600
and I was like no that's okay I I know

00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,550
what's become of the tech interview

00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,610
because I've been doing them previously

00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:23,080
I hadn't done any like really recently

00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,710
because I was pretty happy in my job but

00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,780
I had a number of friends who would quit

00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,040
their full-time jobs in order to do tech

00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,760
interviews does anybody know anybody

00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,410
like that so or have you've done that

00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,110
there's a really good talk at PyCon in

00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:40,930
2016 called has anybody seen up 100 CS

00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:43,150
interviews by susan tan highly recommend

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:46,140
that don't love about like don't love

00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:49,990
what's become of tech interviews overall

00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:52,810
so so I said alright I really want to

00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:56,860
stay with my job so I came back and I

00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:58,090
talked to my boss who's here and she was

00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,120
like well let's see if we can make this

00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,770
work and we talked to HR and HR was like

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,300
yeah this sounds pretty good but then

00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,700
they looked into california tax law and

00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,840
of all the states like california has

00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,120
the most complicated one and they were

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,160
like here's the thing we could hire you

00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,680
as a contractor you're probably not

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,970
gonna like that idea i had the exact

00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,340
opposite reaction from what they were

00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:20,110
expecting i was like whoa like for real

00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,460
like i could i knew other contractors

00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,900
who worked there and it seemed like that

00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,460
you're gonna do whatever they wanted

00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,990
think it like pick the projects they

00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,690
wanted and work from home when they

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:31,960
wanted so I was like ooh that sounds

00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:35,260
interesting so I talked to every single

00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:37,270
contractor I knew emails really long

00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,060
phone calls took them out to lunches and

00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,970
was like how do you

00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:43,610
this and then I just jumped I just did

00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:46,669
it not to say that that didn't come with

00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:48,350
fears and there's a like picture of

00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:50,510
someone writing because I think like

00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:53,360
writing down your fears is a good way to

00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:55,730
address them but also just like thinking

00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:00,440
through them fears are not a bad thing

00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:02,150
fear is there to protect you and you

00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,430
know you probably are gonna face some

00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,770
fear when you have a big life-changing

00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:08,480
decision like deciding to move to

00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:13,010
California are deciding to start your

00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:14,960
own business I don't know girls but I

00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:49,820
really like this this is a 30-second

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:50,810
clip from Gilmore Girls about so I don't

00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,450
know if you got at the very beginning

00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,340
there but well I asked him about how she

00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:58,430
felt so nervous about this decision to

00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:00,350
like start her own in and she's talking

00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,419
to her friend who's a local business

00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:04,729
owner and asking him like what did he do

00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:06,110
about all those fears and he said well

00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:08,270
for the first year I went into my

00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,280
storage room and threw up and you know

00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,620
what that physiological response to fear

00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,479
is super super super real I've been

00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,430
doing this for a little over two years I

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,440
have not had a single time when I didn't

00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,030
have a contract but I can give myself a

00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,100
stomachache by thinking about where's my

00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:24,200
next contract coming from because it's

00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,330
just it's just part of the thing you

00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,460
know but I also like that he's like

00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:30,080
super encouraging to her there which is

00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:35,089
also the experience I had when I talked

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:36,320
to every contractor I knew and then you

00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:38,270
can always have this in the back of your

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,120
mind if you are gonna you know start

00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:42,589
your own business if you decide to start

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,600
your own business if you decide to like

00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:46,550
roll your own and it doesn't work out

00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,830
for whatever reason either you can't

00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:51,230
find the work or you don't like doing it

00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,830
you can go back to W to work there's

00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,380
nothing just

00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,940
you especially especially as like most

00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,520
of us here or a lot of us here are web

00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:01,700
developers like our our tech skills are

00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:04,460
highly highly in need so almost nothing

00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,420
is irreversible and career land all

00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:10,100
right now I'm gonna get to the how-to

00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:12,770
and I'm gonna talk about startup costs

00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,030
because throughout this section where

00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,340
I'm talking about how to run your own

00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:19,760
business I think it's super vital to

00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:21,620
keep your startup costs low because the

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,040
best way to make money is to save money

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,930
right so I'm gonna talk about a couple

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,360
of different business entities there are

00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:32,300
more than these two LLC and sole

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,040
proprietorship but these are the two of

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,990
all the contractors that I currently

00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,270
know they fit into one of these

00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:42,620
categories either formed an LLC or they

00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:44,510
do it as a sole proprietorship so quick

00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,630
definition LLC stands for limited

00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:50,870
liability company it's a private limited

00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:53,780
company in the u.s. so it's purely a

00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,790
u.s. type of institution and it's

00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,410
actually fairly recent a sole

00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:01,190
proprietorship is a little different

00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:02,780
because it's much simpler but it's not a

00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:04,940
legal entity so that's kind of like the

00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:07,070
huge difference between ll forming an

00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:10,490
LLC and all the work that goes into that

00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:12,230
versus just saying like hey I'm gonna be

00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,940
a sole proprietor today like that's

00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:17,960
basically all it takes to start a sole

00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:20,390
proprietor so so there's negative some

00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,800
positives for both some negatives and

00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:24,590
sole proprietorship is that there's

00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:27,740
going to be no distinction between the

00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:29,780
business you form and you so should the

00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,850
worst thing happen should your business

00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:34,430
get sued like your personal assets are

00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:36,470
liable so this is you know this is a

00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:39,380
negative about sole proprietorship you

00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:42,380
you really can't get separate credit

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:44,540
lines and other businesses might not

00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,100
want to work with you if you form a sole

00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:48,680
proprietors if they may not take you

00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:51,200
that seriously maybe you know depending

00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,090
on the business you also can't expand I

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,020
mean sole proprietorship is what the

00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:58,700
name is its sole it's just you

00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,770
so all these negatives you might think

00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,770
like why would I ever form one well it's

00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:05,570
simple and it's cheap and I definitely

00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:07,430
know most of the contractors I know

00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:09,020
formed an LLC but a few of them have

00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:10,670
been doing sole proprietorship for many

00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,500
years and it just works for them just

00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,690
fine and it means they had a lot fewer

00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,610
forms to fill out and they had a few

00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,710
hundred dollars less of start-up costs

00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:21,260
and so works for them okay

00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:23,810
so I would say of the two they're both

00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:26,660
pretty good but I chose LLC I think it's

00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:28,190
the better one for me when I was talking

00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,010
to all the consultants when I was

00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:32,960
starting this whole thing every single

00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:36,110
one of them said form an LLC it's like

00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:38,240
having free business insurance it's a

00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:40,970
way to separate yourself from from your

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,700
business so how do you form an LLC these

00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:45,200
are the forms you're going to need so

00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,750
you've got your application for your EIN

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:51,440
which stands for employer identification

00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:53,690
number and that's the number that the

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,360
clients that you work with are gonna

00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:58,700
need in order to pay you and like file

00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,540
their w9s and i know this is like the

00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:04,190
really exciting part of the talk

00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:06,140
articles of organization and these acts

00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,880
as a charter for your business and say

00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:10,460
what you're gonna do in your business

00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,710
the only time I've needed these are when

00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:14,240
I formed my OC and when I signed up for

00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:16,580
a business checking account I've never

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,170
needed these any other time so I don't

00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:21,320
really know what they're needed for

00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:22,910
other than to like set it all up and

00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,710
then you're gonna need your secretary of

00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,480
state statement information so this

00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:28,580
tells your secretary of state your

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,940
business name and your registered agent

00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:34,580
which I'm gonna get back to I used Legal

00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:36,950
Zoom for this process I liked them quite

00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,780
a bit in some ways they had one huge

00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:42,500
negative but I'll get to that in a

00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:43,970
moment I would also say you know while

00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,490
I'm suggesting LegalZoom on the slide I

00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:49,310
would also say consider talking to a

00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:50,630
local lawyer because then you get a then

00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,490
you get this like relationship with

00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:54,110
someone and you can use them again if

00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:56,180
you need them and it's kind of nice to

00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:58,040
have that so I would say they're

00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:00,080
LegalZoom or talk to a local lawyer if

00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,670
you can find one who's gonna charge you

00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,550
not too much because Legal Zoom is

00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:07,900
pretty inexpensive if you choose like

00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:10,910
the cheapest wizard which is what I did

00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,080
she's a registered agent so as I was

00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:14,510
going through that Legal Zoom wizard

00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,040
setting up my LLC they said you need a

00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:17,810
registered agent and we have a really

00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,670
cheap service so just use us and I did a

00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,170
little googling

00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,000
much and was like alright I guess you

00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:23,740
guys are cheap and I have to have one I

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,810
have no idea what they are all right

00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:28,030
you're my registered agent and then I

00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:30,970
get this separate bill from LegalZoom

00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:34,120
for $300 and I called them and I was

00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:36,970
like mmm I don't want this so I googled

00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,010
it and it turns out you can be your own

00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,510
registered agent and you don't need to

00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:42,760
do anything fancy it's not like you need

00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:44,290
to be a notary or anything like all you

00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,720
need is a registered agent it's like a

00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:48,100
physical address where you can be found

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,570
during business hours so if you're

00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,080
working from home that's your home

00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,940
address

00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,620
so I guess you're gonna get a little bit

00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:56,350
more business junk mail which is about

00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:58,090
the only negative I can think of you're

00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,560
a little more findable if you want to

00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:03,880
you know stay off the grid it's not

00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:05,380
great but you're also gonna want to open

00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,030
a business checking account so this is

00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,620
super important especially if you're

00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:10,120
forming an LLC and you want to take

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,340
advantage of the fact that you are

00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,140
separate from your business because if

00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,910
you call me go funds you're kind of

00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:18,670
erasing everything that you get from

00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:20,710
having an LLC so you're you know your

00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,600
clients that work with you through

00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,770
whatever payment system they're gonna

00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,110
want your business checking account

00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:27,640
they're not gonna want to pay you

00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:29,230
directly to your personal account so

00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,970
it's a little different from being w2

00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:33,790
and giving them your personal accountant

00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:36,460
they direct deposit they really want a

00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:38,200
business checking account so for this

00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:40,120
you're gonna need to have forms your

00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,140
business and you're gonna need your your

00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:46,390
employer identification number and your

00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:49,780
your Charter your articles of

00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:52,360
organization so however you can save on

00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,340
startup costs here as well by googling

00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,650
free business checking and finding any

00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:58,330
number of online banks out there that do

00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:00,910
free business checking or do like I do

00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:02,470
which is I found a local bank I liked I

00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,350
walked in and was like what do I have to

00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:07,690
do to not pay for business checking like

00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:09,700
what what criteria do I need to meet to

00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:12,310
not pay for it like what what gets the

00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:15,850
fee waived and yeah like it's a lot of

00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:17,860
banks do it so um you're gonna want to

00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:19,210
choose a name you absolutely have to do

00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,400
this if you're forming a business you

00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:23,290
want it to be memorable distinct and

00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,450
easy to spell and it has to be available

00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:28,840
in your state so when I forms my

00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:30,640
business in California I checked an Erin

00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,260
Rachael consulting which is my first and

00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,090
middle name

00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:37,350
and what I'm doing in a very general

00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:38,850
sense was available and I'm really not

00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,550
creative when it comes to naming things

00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:44,790
so that that worked for me don't ask me

00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:47,580
to name your band but one other note

00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:49,200
here registered trademarks are not

00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:52,290
allowed so a friend of mine who is

00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:54,810
another contractor he wanted to use the

00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:57,150
word Python in his business name so

00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,660
capital P Python and I forget what the

00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,330
name was

00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,530
but he didn't look into it first and he

00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,670
just sent it off to the Secretary of

00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:04,260
State so he had to fill out that form

00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,690
twice because Secretary of State came

00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:10,140
back in there like nope so you can't be

00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:12,840
like the Disney Netflix bank of America

00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:13,650
coding him for him like yeah I come up

00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,250
with something different

00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:19,290
um create a website so I'm gonna really

00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:21,090
go oh yeah I mean who doesn't have a

00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:23,340
website in this room but you want to be

00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:25,010
able to be findable out there on the

00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,910
internet there's free options out there

00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:28,530
but some of them might be a little

00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:32,370
unprofessional because they have then

your website or your slides I like to

00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:07,830
give the photographers props but I don't

00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:11,550
have to do you need a logo I don't know

00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:12,660
maybe um I don't have a logo but

00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:16,710
depending on your business you might

00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:20,250
need one who's heard of canva not too

00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:23,100
many oh cool all right yeah yeah yeah so

00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:26,250
canva is a really great online graphic

00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:29,850
design tool I'm not a graphic designer

00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:31,500
but I can use it so it's like easy so

00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:33,930
it's it's really cool my husband

00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,850
introduced it to me and first I was

00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:38,010
using it for like social media posts

00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:39,630
like for personal reasons but I've used

00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:41,490
it for some professional reasons now it

00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:43,710
just makes it really easy it is all free

00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:45,030
they have a paid version with a few

00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:49,679
other bells and whistles but

00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:51,210
the free version kind of covers you so

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,890
this is my like number one tip for

00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:55,530
starting her own business I would say

00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:58,799
hire an accountant like just find an

00:17:55,530 --> 00:18:00,150
accountant to work with you I have been

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,730
working with my accountant since I

00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:05,820
formed my business and he's he's just so

00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:09,450
great he is fantastic he does my taxes

00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:11,610
and when you form your business you

00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,860
actually don't have to necessarily do

00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:15,480
payroll because if you're just you you

00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,740
can just like transfer you can get paid

00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,570
into your business checking account and

00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,010
transfer money out which is what I was

00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:23,370
doing in the very beginning but then I

00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:27,360
wanted to have a solo 401k for my

00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:28,830
business my retirement fund and I talked

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,010
to him about it and he said well the

00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:33,840
easiest and both like most up on the up

00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,730
and up way to do that is to have payroll

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,309
so you can then calculate how much you

00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:40,320
are like actually allowed to put into

00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:43,789
your retirement plan based on what you

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,990
pay yourself so he does my payroll now -

00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:48,450
quarterly estimated payment so I have a

00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:49,440
note about this so if you're forming

00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,840
your business so let's say you're

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,990
forming your business this year and

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,179
you've been a w-2 employee so you

00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:58,590
absolutely if you are if you have your

00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:00,630
own business want to pay your quarterly

00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:02,940
estimated payments throughout the year

00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,770
which are like January and like every

00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,200
quarter you're gonna be paying the state

00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:09,570
from the federal level what you estimate

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,830
you're gonna owe them at the end of you

00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:16,200
know come April 15th so you absolutely

00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,850
must do that or you actually have to pay

00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,080
a fairly high penalty I asked my

00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,850
accountant about this because I was like

00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,990
do I really can I just pay the penalty

00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:25,200
and he was like he told me what it was

00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:27,150
like so yeah you want to pay these um

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,740
but for that first year that you form

00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:31,470
your business one of my contractor

00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,600
friends told me this you as long as you

00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:36,480
were a w-2 employee also that year you

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,950
don't have to pay them that year so I

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,080
didn't I just like put that money away

00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,970
like that's for me is a little more time

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,120
I got to spend and in my savings account

00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:48,150
or my whatever brokerage account or

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,130
whatever so something to know for sure

00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:54,899
if you're just freshly forming her

00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:57,450
business also he helped me decide to you

00:19:54,899 --> 00:19:59,399
know after I'd formed my LLC he

00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:01,169
files me as an S corp and this has to do

00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:02,580
with like how much money you make if you

00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:04,860
file as an S corp you couldn't save a

00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,630
little money too I found my accountant

00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:09,690
on thumbtack have you all heard of

00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:11,850
thumbtack anybody interviewed there they

00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:14,279
were a really good interview um and I

00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:17,370
didn't work there but I did it there so

00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,820
thumbtack is have you heard of Angie's

00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:20,669
List

00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:23,929
it's like Angie's List but it's free and

00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:26,250
it's better it's like got a better UI so

00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:28,799
see you later Angie's List

00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:33,600
so thumbtack is oh I hope they're not

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:35,909
here um do they still exist

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,440
um so yeah thumbtack is huge if you have

00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:39,690
like any service people that you're

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,360
hiring in general like highly recommend

00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:44,549
even for your like personal use

00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,549
my accountant I love him so much he

00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:48,960
loves me too I'm sure um so one thing I

00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:50,029
do that I think makes him love me a

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,529
little bit as I keep a running

00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:54,659
spreadsheet of my money coming in and my

00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:56,789
money going out and that helps him to

00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:58,559
figure out what to pay and those

00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:00,510
quarterly estimated payments and then

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:03,000
also when he does my taxes he looks at

00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:06,419
he looks at that and I'm gonna give you

00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,490
a free example here so you can find this

00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:10,139
it's on there's like a whole page of

00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:12,960
links if you go to bitly slash roll your

00:21:10,139 --> 00:21:16,649
own biz everything that I'm mentioning

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,450
here today is on this page but this is a

00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:20,490
like screen this is kind of a terrible

00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:22,860
screenshot of a Google Doc that I use

00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:25,740
it's a sample of a Google Docs is not my

00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:28,590
real one but as you can see I'm keeping

00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:31,590
track of a payment so when I you know I

00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:33,570
invoice out and I once it gets once it

00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,220
goes into my account then I track it

00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:38,090
here I say like the the date that it

00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,049
came in and the amount that I invoiced

00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:42,029
anything to do with my business you know

00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:44,190
I pay for a yearly subscription to

00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:45,779
Google Drive or I bought an Amazon

00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,730
headset like anything that I'm using for

00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:50,190
my business is an expense so these are

00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,659
like paying my accountant CPA fee these

00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:54,029
are super obvious things that you might

00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:56,100
think like oh of course but one thing

00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:59,519
that I didn't realize until I talked to

00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:01,740
all these contractors was you can also

00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:04,649
expense a portion of your rent or your

00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:06,090
mortgage so and I'm seeing nodding heads

00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:09,090
some people know this already but I

00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:11,370
think not everybody knows this so up to

00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:13,650
I think it's 25%

00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:16,200
depending on square footage so it's very

00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:19,680
like mathy but you have to take the

00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:21,450
square footage of your home and you have

00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,740
to have dedicated space to your office

00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:25,440
so let's say you have a two-bedroom

00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,900
apartment and it's a thousand square

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,880
feet and you have a 100 square foot room

00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,070
in which you do your business and that's

00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,270
really just like that spare bedroom is

00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:36,150
really just dedicated to your business

00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:37,920
in that case that's 10 percent of your

00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,900
square footage so 10 percent of your

00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:42,390
rent each month or your mortgage or

00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,280
whatever can get expensed so you can

00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:46,710
keep track of that and that percentage

00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,890
also goes to utilities so your water and

00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:52,800
trash and electric all those things you

00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:54,600
can expense them all you know traveling

00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,890
for conferences these are the kind of

00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,220
things that you might be thinking of but

00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:04,260
that percentage is a huge way to save

00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:05,730
money so as you are forming your own

00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:09,120
business you're gonna have to roll your

00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:10,500
own benefits as well and one of the

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,990
things I've mentioned earlier was I

00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:16,500
started my own solo 401k for my business

00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:19,440
and you may know that the maximum for

00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:22,530
employee contributions this year 2019

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:25,170
was 19 thousand sure everybody knows

00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:28,380
that right but the what you might not

00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:30,750
know is that employer contributions on

00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,790
top of that our 25 percent of employee

00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:35,010
compensation so what I decide to pay

00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:37,950
myself on payroll I can take 25 percent

00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:40,650
of that and put that in my 401k - that's

00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:43,160
like way more money than w-2 employees

00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:46,440
can can put away which is pretty great

00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:48,240
it's a total it's a max from what I like

00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,180
right on line it's a max of 56 thousand

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,730
which is so much higher than 19-thousand

00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:55,470
but yeah so I'm not sure if that total

00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:58,620
is correct or not but I found that on a

00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:59,820
website um you're also gonna want to get

00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,590
your own health insurance so I think

00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:04,410
this is actually what probably hangs

00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:05,880
most people up in the u.s. from running

00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,770
their own show right yeah I've seen

00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,000
nodding heads again it's like yeah when

00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:11,910
are we gonna get Medicare for all know

00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:17,310
it's another story another talk um don't

00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:21,360
at me um so when I form my business in

00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:22,680
California so the California State

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,150
Employees my husband was working for the

00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,050
school district there the state

00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:28,050
employees

00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:30,179
have amazing benefits they have Kaiser

00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:31,530
which is know really great they're also

00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:33,390
like striking which is awesome but

00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:36,360
they're Kaiser which is a really great

00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:38,160
health system and I was able to get on

00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,170
his benefits for free in California

00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,940
which was sweet well then we moved back

00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:43,320
to North Carolina and I was like I'll

00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,660
just be on your benefits again and then

00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:48,270
we got the bill for like $700 a month I

00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:49,800
was like I think I can get cheaper

00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:53,160
health insurance I'm just like never go

00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:54,630
to the doctor so that's what I do I have

00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,650
a high deductible health care plan which

00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:59,220
is called they never go to the doctor

00:24:55,650 --> 00:25:02,340
plan unless you would have pay up to

00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:04,590
$7,000 in your deductible first however

00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,450
you can also with a high deductible

00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:08,490
health care plan you can get an HSA

00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:10,290
which is really nice this is a little

00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:12,660
bit of extra funds on top of that money

00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:15,120
that you can do pre-tax as well you can

00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:18,809
put up to this year it's 3,500 in your

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:21,150
HSA as a single person so that money can

00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:22,860
then be you can use it at the doctor's I

00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:25,650
don't I actually just invest mine

00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:27,300
because if you have up to it's a

00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:29,130
thousand two thousand I don't know them

00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,630
a number but if you have up to a certain

00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:34,140
amount in your HSA account you can

00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:35,550
actually also invest that you're also

00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,050
gonna want to think about vacation and

00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:39,360
holidays it's really important to not

00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:40,890
burn yourself out so as you're planning

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,630
as you're working for yourself and

00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:45,630
you're like oh I can work every day like

00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:47,490
who needs Saturday and Sunday off yeah

00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:49,740
you don't really want to do that in my

00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:51,929
opinion um so you you're gonna want to

00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:53,250
think through like what days you want to

00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:55,470
tell people that you're not gonna be

00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,420
available when you are working with

00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:59,490
clients

00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:01,679
okay so hiring an accountant best

00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:04,230
decision determining your rate hardest

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,700
decision 100% hardest decision I don't

00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:08,580
know what you all feel like this is

00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:10,740
great but I I think the best way to

00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,990
determine your rate is actually to kind

00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,720
of get a consensus I think this is

00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:17,070
probably the best way and it's my

00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,929
feeling that if you talk to other

00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:21,570
consultants you know and you tell them

00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:24,390
what you're charging they're more likely

00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:26,429
to tell the tell you you know to sort of

00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:29,640
reciprocate that and I've I found that

00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:32,520
really works you can also use this

00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:35,010
formula I didn't end up using this but I

00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:37,860
know some people do so you take the

00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,740
salary of like let's say that position

00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,090
that you're that

00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:42,340
you're working with here's the salary

00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:44,530
for that kind of work multiply it by two

00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:47,170
and you divide it by the number of hours

00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:48,970
you would work for a year and that would

00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:50,590
be a rate that would be a good rate

00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:53,530
though that was way higher than what my

00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:58,420
clients were really today but it's a

00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:59,950
formula somebody's using um you can ask

00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,690
your client so you can go ahead and like

00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:03,160
if you were if your client is excited to

00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:05,200
work with you they probably would tell

00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,429
you like the range they might they might

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,860
he'll probably tell you the low end of

00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:10,360
the range anyway you know this kind of

00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,730
puts the negotiating in their court so

00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:15,520
it's like I don't know I did I asked

00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:17,320
they're just research it's not it's

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,210
that's probably I mean other than

00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:22,660
healthcare it's like a huge hangout for

00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:24,400
running your own business when you're

00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:26,590
writing your contracts you want to

00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,600
include paint you can include payment

00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:31,690
dates like within 30 days of receipt of

00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,700
my contract my invoice I expect payments

00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:35,920
you can consider putting languages

00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,570
around a late fee in case they are kind

00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:40,360
of a client who might not pay you on

00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:44,679
time this would get them excited to pay

00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:47,140
you on time alright so well I play

00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:49,270
through that awesome um finding clients

00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,110
so this is like my most fun part of the

00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:53,710
talk to me

00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:55,270
so there's I'd say that social media can

00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:59,620
be bad and good I mean I think that's

00:27:55,270 --> 00:28:02,770
just like so generally true but I mean

00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:06,100
the bad side is that you are now a

00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:09,090
little bit more public of who you are so

00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:11,860
like what you're posting is you know may

00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:13,890
make people unhappy so you kind of want

00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:18,179
to think about that but there's good -

00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:21,130
for sure so I have this example here I

00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:23,950
so this is when we moved we moved in

00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:25,809
July of 2017 to California we moved back

00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:28,780
a year later because we didn't want to

00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:32,080
stay there but that's another talk - so

00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:34,690
we moved in July and I posted this on

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,340
Facebook just like for fun whatever say

00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:38,770
hey I give myself two weeks off for this

00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:40,510
move it's a huge amount of and next week

00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:42,130
I'm going to start as a consultant and

00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:44,590
this was I was gonna start working with

00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:46,000
with that company that I had been

00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,850
working with full time but as a

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,250
consultant now

00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:54,240
and it got the attention of somebody at

00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:57,180
another former employer the University

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,460
of Pennsylvania who said like hey I've

00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:00,660
got a project to I you know you just

00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,550
saying you're working for yourself now

00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:06,270
so that means you're a free agent and so

00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:08,820
this actually this turned into a project

00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:10,260
off and on since that time I've been

00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,080
working on like I've been working with

00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:16,530
that team off and on so I mean there's

00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:18,120
definitely benefits to being vocal on

00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:21,270
social media when it comes to you

00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,770
running your own business you might want

00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:25,830
to get published so write a technical

00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:28,110
blog post and get noticed by that

00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:30,270
company that built that awesome CMS you

00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:32,520
know and like kind of like maybe work

00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:35,430
with them as a client you might want to

00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:37,710
give talks that's that I don't know that

00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:39,480
this has worked for anyone who I know

00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:40,980
personally but I feel like you know

00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,310
anything you can do to get your name out

00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:47,880
there is really good reach out to former

00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:49,440
employers and gratitude so these are

00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:54,270
separate bullets but I have a story

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,800
about this as well I had worked at

00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:58,020
University of Pennsylvania for many

00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:00,090
years and I had many good bosses there

00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,500
and I I feel like all my bosses I've

00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,970
learned so many different things and

00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,740
have like been important to me in

00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:06,720
different passes but I had this one

00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:10,170
particular boss who was my last boss at

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,690
University of Pennsylvania who was so

00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:14,340
great and he was like so technical when

00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:15,600
I needed someone to be technical in my

00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,710
career like I was at that point in my

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,750
career where I was ready to advance

00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:22,050
technically and then he was just like a

00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:25,710
kind person so he was so great and I had

00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:28,830
run into someone who worked for him at a

00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:30,690
icon and I was talking about him Jason

00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:32,160
is the name of my former boss I was

00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:34,500
talking about him to this like co-worker

00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,790
I was like man he was such a good such a

00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,370
good boss they should really just like

00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:40,230
write to him and tell him that and I was

00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:42,360
like yeah just do it and so I went home

00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,620
and I like wrote this like monkey mail

00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,890
was just like yeah you were really great

00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:48,870
and he responded and it was 100% just

00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:51,930
like gratitude in my heart I was not I

00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:53,490
had work I was fine but I just wanted to

00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:56,970
like share that because he was so

00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:58,350
important to me and he responded and I

00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:01,190
have a lot of former bosses here so you

00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:01,190
are all getting emails

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:07,450
so he responded well I'm having such a

00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:10,240
stressful day that was like just what I

00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:12,130
needed thank you so much also are you

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,400
working for yourself now because we're

00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:17,560
transitioning this website to Django so

00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,750
can you come back and work with us like

00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,730
as a consultant and so yeah I worked on

00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:24,160
that project for a year until completion

00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:25,780
the project is now live and it was great

00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,250
I loved working on the project cuz I had

00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:31,600
built it in cold fusion I said it

00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:34,480
initially and so I got to transition it

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:37,300
to Django yeah um so that was just great

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,910
there are you know this is like I said

00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:43,960
this is like my heart finding clients is

00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:46,060
is really is really the exciting part it

00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,640
can be a little bit nerve-wracking but

00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:52,000
it's also pretty great it's especially

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:55,750
great if you keep this in mind just as

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,270
your mantra and I when I hesitate to say

00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:59,920
like always be giving all the time of

00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:04,750
yourself because that's a surefire way

00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:06,280
for burnout but always be giving during

00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:08,680
the work you know during the work day

00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,730
um think of your think of the person

00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,560
that you're working for whether you're a

00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:14,350
w-2 employee or you work for yourself

00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,460
think of what they need and ask them and

00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,230
always be giving and always been

00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:20,500
thinking of them and putting putting

00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:22,480
their needs at the top you know or near

00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:26,500
the top of your list and you'll be

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:28,660
surprised at what comes back to you this

00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:31,660
is uh I mean it's such a simple phrase

00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:35,140
but it's Alan Donegan who started he

00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:37,150
formed this company in in England called

00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:38,830
the pop-up business school and he helps

00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:42,040
like fledgling entrepreneurs who are

00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:43,360
pretty like pretty like small-scale he

00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,980
helps them like figure out how to run

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,070
their businesses and and there's a good

00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:50,410
podcast where he's interviewed that I a

00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:51,160
link to on that page that I'm gonna

00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:56,800
share again

00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:58,600
um so always be giving um so I did

00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:01,120
earlier talk about rolling your own

00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:04,240
benefits but there are definitely

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,310
benefits to rolling your own job you can

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,860
work when and where you want I have a

00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:12,520
friend one of the many contractors who I

00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:14,650
had a phone call with he works once once

00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:17,860
a week he go he travels by uber

00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:20,350
or lift he takes a left into the city to

00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:21,610
work and he opens up the back in the

00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:23,350
back of the car he like opens up his

00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:25,630
laptop and answers emails and that's

00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:27,160
billable time for him that's great

00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:29,770
you're turning travel time into billable

00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:31,270
time I don't want to work in a car but

00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:34,660
it works for him that's great

00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:37,330
you can set your own hours within reason

00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:39,070
so you are still going to be working

00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:40,900
with clients who are you know in the

00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:43,150
office during office hours and they

00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:45,520
probably want you available at least

00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:47,260
part of that time but you can scale like

00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:49,360
like you might want to scale back to

00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:52,000
thirty or thirty two hours or you know

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,370
whatever and you can kind of set that

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,960
set that schedule where you feel like

00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:58,030
you can put in that number of hours at a

00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,280
computer and still feel human I think

00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:04,390
that's super important and one of the

00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:06,310
biggest benefits to me for sure so and

00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:09,159
you can you can turn away projects so

00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:11,110
basically you can you can get a I have

00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:13,830
turned away a project it was for like a

00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:17,409
like a muscle farming or something like

00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:18,909
yeah I know it's like I'm a vegan so I

00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:21,159
don't really want that like help someone

00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:22,360
kill muscles like are they even alive I

00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:27,580
don't know but I don't want to eat them

00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:29,590
they're good let's go snoring so you can

00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:31,960
work for who you won and like I actually

00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:33,640
yeah and a positive side of that would

00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,380
be like there was a company I really

00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:37,540
want as a work weapon so I got to work

00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:39,399
with them too for it for like a little

00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:44,230
Stanton so that was that was really fun

00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:46,270
for me um wow I'm doing so fast that's

00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:47,080
amazing yeah I am definitely gonna have

00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:50,590
time for questions

00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:54,840
a little contracting by the numbers

00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:59,110
so this NPR did a whole thing on

00:34:54,840 --> 00:35:01,180
contracting in 2018 so you can go to

00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:03,790
that link that I'll share again and find

00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:06,880
the NPR section on contracting that they

00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:08,020
did like a little mini radio episodes

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,460
and things like that and they also

00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:15,610
gather data and one in five US workers

00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:17,410
are contract workers so I thought I feel

00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:20,200
like that's really high like I did not

00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:22,360
figure that would be that high in our

00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,220
industry it seems like about right but I

00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:27,680
was actually like really surprised by

00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:31,130
that less surprised about this

00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:34,160
65% of those contractors are our male so

00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:35,539
going back to that story of calling and

00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,519
emailing and having lunch with those

00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:40,130
contractors every single one of them was

00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:43,309
a man I've since met some female

00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:46,220
contractors which is great but I'd like

00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:47,690
to I think a little bit if you're a man

00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:51,829
don't let that like hold you back but

00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:55,190
yeah I was back a little bit we get 5050

00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:57,740
that way nice I mean even some further

00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:59,390
reading and listening on the topic I

00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:01,160
mentioned Alan Donegan earlier he was

00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:05,390
interviewed on the cheese fi podcast

00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:07,579
that is my absolute favorite podcast out

00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:09,470
there if anybody's familiar with the

00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:12,200
fire movement it's like probably one of

00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:14,240
the biggest ones about that journey to

00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,099
launch is another like fire related fire

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:22,670
stands for financial independence retire

00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:25,010
early it's not a cult but it is journey

00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:27,769
to lunch is another like if I like

00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:29,510
related podcast and episode 38 is a

00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:31,160
pretty good one of that I think that's

00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:33,859
where she interviews an accountant and

00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:35,660
so I actually got a lot of tips for by

00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:37,190
day to day and also for this talk from

00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:39,559
from that that was a really great

00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:41,569
episode highly recommend that one I

00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:43,519
mentioned Suze Moore's book what if it

00:36:41,569 --> 00:36:47,750
does work out a little bit during this

00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:49,789
talk and it was it was like I read it on

00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:52,099
a plane right so it's a short one about

00:36:49,789 --> 00:36:54,890
how she decided to like slowly

00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:56,630
transition to working for herself from

00:36:54,890 --> 00:37:01,069
being in an office and like staring

00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:02,809
longingly out the window money slam

00:37:01,069 --> 00:37:04,400
podcast money explained is a podcast

00:37:02,809 --> 00:37:07,579
that's like super short form

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,079
I like episode six but really all of

00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:11,599
them are good episode six is called

00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:12,019
freelance isn't free so that's a good

00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,140
one

00:37:12,019 --> 00:37:17,299
NPR has a that I mentioned that poll

00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:19,730
there and they have a few other articles

00:37:17,299 --> 00:37:22,369

accountant and she's just so fun and

00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:29,900
relatable highly recommend her and then

resources I mentioned during my talk

00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,390

thanks a lot everything that was really

00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:01,800
interesting and it seems that your

00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:06,600
bosses have been really important and

00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:07,950
valuable to you all along but how good

00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,140
is your current boss that helped you

00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:11,460
along

00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:13,290
she's pretty jealous yeah I don't really

00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:17,310
have to like ask for vacation and I just

00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:19,410
take it yeah that's for great I do miss

00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:24,480
having a boss like leaving Karen was

00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:26,730
super hard so yeah iron do you have any

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,470
tips for getting out of pajamas in the

00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:31,290
morning keeping the motivation up for

00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:37,550
that and avoiding isolation oh well I

00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:40,380
get out of pajamas are super comfy um I

00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:42,960
mean get outside like the first thing I

00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:45,450
do most days is I go out for like a walk

00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,210
I I have a trail behind my apartment so

00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:49,770
I I think like exercise is probably like

00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:51,510
the best way to start a day but that's

00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:52,800
like if you work for yourself or don't

00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:54,600
work for yourself I think that's true

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,520
let's get outside and exercise a little

00:39:54,600 --> 00:40:02,970
if you can in Philly it's hard with

00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:04,890
those winters hi I also have a LLC that

00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:06,450
I'm running but I'm definitely doing

00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:07,560
something different so I just wanted to

00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:09,840
get your opinion you might have

00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,580
researched this topic I don't have a

00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:15,200
countin so what I do is that I have

00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:17,370
online QuickBooks that is linked to my

00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,650
accounts and the credit card accounts

00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:20,880
and it will fetch all my transactions

00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,930
and it will create a balance sheet for

00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,270
me in the end of the year and I do it

00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:26,070
myself so but you said there its number

00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:29,220
one tip is like how accountant so I was

00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:30,720
wondering am I missing anything no I

00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:34,730
mean if you are comfortable doing it

00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:37,440
yourself like I'd say do it yourself I I

00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:40,110
tried I tried like a QuickBooks

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,940
competitor I forget what they were

00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:43,740
called but I was just like that is way

00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,990
too much overhead for me I'd rather just

00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:48,510
keep that that spreadsheet that I have

00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:50,430
like an example on this page that

00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:52,650
spreadsheet does everything for me as

00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:53,850
far as like tracking my expenses so one

00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,710
thing I didn't mention is it's super

00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:57,870
important to keep those receipts and

00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:59,160
bills so I keep all those in Google

00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:02,610
Drive so that's why I pay for Google

00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:04,740
Drive - so hang on to those receipts you

00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:06,500
never need them hopefully but they're

00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:09,230
there

00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:11,630
and I have been asked about QuickBooks

00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:14,119
before I find it to be like way too much

00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:15,680
overhead for me personally and I'd much

00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:18,800
rather just have an accountant who I can

00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:25,820
trust but I mean if that's working for

00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:27,920
you no reason no hi thank you for the

00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:30,200
talk I wondered if you know of any

00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,300
complications between being based out of

00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,460
multiple places multiple states or

00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:36,859
moving while you're contracting that's

00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:38,210
interesting I think you just form your

00:41:36,859 --> 00:41:40,190
business where you form your business

00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:42,980
and that's like where you file your

00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:47,359
taxes but ask your accountant because

00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:48,650
yeah yeah yeah I'm pretty sure it's like

00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:53,840
where you form your business is where

00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:56,900
you file your taxes um I actually have a

00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:59,150
question so I have a small business

00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:01,700
where I'm working mostly with clients

00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:03,020
that are not in the tech industry and I

00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:05,330
find it really hard to keep myself

00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:07,130
updated with the big tech company

00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:08,930
advancements because when I try to go on

00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:10,820
the web it's overwhelming and I don't

00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:12,440
know where should I be focusing on do

00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,849
you have a few resources for people to

00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,010
stay up-to-date with the recent

00:42:13,849 --> 00:42:18,470
technology or invest in advancements

00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:20,240
maybe in Django Python or specific

00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:21,740
websites that we should keep ourselves

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,390
okay to do it I think this goes back to

00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:26,420
the question that Tim had about like not

00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:29,330
isolating yourself so I've been

00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:31,640
fortunate enough to work on I have yet

00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:33,080
to work by myself on a project well

00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:35,180
that's not true I have like one project

00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:38,030
that I've worked by myself on but I

00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:40,430
really prefer not to prefer to work in

00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:42,880
teams and I prefer to like get to know

00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:45,410
the teams I think it's really nice to

00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,000
try to like connect with them as much as

00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:49,820
possible like even if it's only slack

00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,200
but if you can if you start a client

00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:52,490
project and you know I was talking to

00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,510
someone about this today and you know

00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:55,700
you're gonna be working with them for

00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:57,680
four months is it possible for you to go

00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:00,349
visit them for just one day and get to

00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:03,290
know them and I think communicating with

00:43:00,349 --> 00:43:04,580
other team members is just I mean I work

00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:07,130
with cactus a lot I work with the

00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:09,380
University of Penn a lot and like I am

00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:12,140
able to kind of keep up just by like

00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:14,780
seeing what my other people around me

00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:19,070
are doing all right you have any more

00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:20,270
question okay she will also be available

00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:22,220
in the hallway if you have any

00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:24,020
questions or comments but let's give her

00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,280
a big round of applause for the

00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:27,800
information

00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:41,090
[Applause]

00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:41,090
