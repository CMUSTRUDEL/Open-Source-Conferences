00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:21,110
hi everyone my name is Eleanor and my

00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,730
talk today is really intended to be some

00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,860
things that you can take away with you

00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,509
to your job on Wednesday or whenever you

00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,430
leave here sort of think of it as

00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:31,490
product management in a box and what

00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:33,290
I've tried to do is take some frameworks

00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,510
I learned in business school and

00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,699
condense them down into various sort of

00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,750
product specific things so I'm hoping by

00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:40,220
the end of this talk that you'll have a

00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:43,190
few things you can you can take home

00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:46,729
with you and use so to introduce myself

00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:48,920
my name is Eleanor I've in my eighth

00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:51,140
year as a PM I've been in the tech

00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,839
industry for more like 12 at this point

00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:56,239
in the San Francisco Bay Area mostly

00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:58,220
I've been both a manager of PM's and an

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,769
individual contributor p.m. so it kind

00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:03,290
of had both of those experiences I've

00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:06,140
worked in companies of ten people and a

00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:08,570
hundred thousand people so and some

00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,710
things in between so I've I think that

00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,090
what I'm going to show you today is

00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,770
applicable in a lot of different

00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,229
environments I've also worked on look

00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:19,219
DIF alot of different kinds of products

00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:21,049
so I've worked on ad tech products on HR

00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:23,149
analytics products on customer

00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:25,670
experience products pretty broad range

00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:27,350
and it still works so if you work in

00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,689
software I think there's probably

00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,820
something for everybody here I've also

00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:34,810
been on this stage before I spoke at

00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:37,549
Jango Khan in 2016 and 2018 both on

00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,719
technical topics on side projects I was

00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:41,240
doing with natural language processing

00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,820
and my first one was a very first one

00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,649
was about users in Django so it's pretty

00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:50,270
exciting to be talking about my day job

00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:52,159
for a change so who is this talk for so

00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,450
the genesis of this talk was actually

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,920
when you don't have a product manager

00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,479
and the reason I say that is I have

00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,399
engineers come up to me every so often

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,920
and say I don't have a product manager

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,200
for this internal tool or for this this

00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,179
very like super back-end technical

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,069
project that has to do with you know

00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:09,229
read platforming the whole application

00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:11,240
or something like that but I want to I

00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,610
want to understand what it is you do so

00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,440
I can kind of get in the important parts

00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,910
so that's what I was trying to do with

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,700
this but I would recommend having a

00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:21,110
product manager because fun story I

00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,280
became a product manager because a bunch

00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,770
of engineers built something that we

00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,840
couldn't sell so I want to fix it

00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,910
so I recommend having a product manager

00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,650
where you can if you need to support a

00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,540
product manager so oftentimes you've

00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,069
seen how we are we're frazzled we're

00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,900
Haggard we're in a thousand meetings if

00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:37,489
you need to help somebody and definitely

00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,470
I've fall into this category before you

00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:42,140
need to help someone hopefully you'll

00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:44,480
find some good fodder for that too or if

00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:47,690
you want to be a product manager I mean

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,250
I'm not sure why but you gotta if you're

00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:51,620
in engineering it's a pretty good gig

00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,569
but if you do want to transition to

00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,860
product management some of what I'm

00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:57,019
going to show you is actually probably

00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,569
pretty useful for interviews and sort of

00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:01,790
getting yourself in that mindset and

00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:03,680
then finally if you have an interest in

00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,269
developing product management skills in

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,860
your current role sort of how it's

00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:08,569
useful for me to have written code

00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,010
before and done a little bit of design

00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:10,730
because I kind of had to even though I

00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,220
was terrible at it

00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:15,799
it is helpful for you I think to as an

00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,900
engineer to understand what's what's

00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:19,640
going on in our world and what I've

00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,230
tried to do here is focus on things that

00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,660
go on in our world that you don't

00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:25,489
necessarily see or see all the time

00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,170
so this isn't a talk about how we write

00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:28,400
a spec because you've probably seen us

00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,959
write a spec and you've worked with us

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,200
in writing a spec it's all that other

00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:35,359
stuff that takes place sort of away from

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,230
from design and engineering that I'm

00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:41,450
going to really focus on today so here's

00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:43,040
what product management is to me and the

00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,870
way I'm going to focus this talk again

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,609
isn't to talk about writing good specs

00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,920
or you know how to fill in for your

00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:50,269
product manager doing that to me product

00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,160
management is really about building a

00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:54,319
vision around what customers need what

00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,480
the market needs whether they know it or

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,760
not figure out what that vision is

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,480
rallying the organization behind that

00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,670
vision and then finding a path to value

00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,590
so basically you have to build stuff

00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:09,530
that makes sense that people will buy

00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:12,799
and that's that's a lot harder than it

00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:15,709
than it might look sometimes so what

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,570
we'll cover today originally I was going

00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:19,280
to shape this talk around parts of the

00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,690
lifecycle but as I was writing it I

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,510
realized that that isn't necessarily

00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,370
that helpful and actually the most

00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:27,950
useful frameworks are useful at all of

00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,720
these different points so and these I

00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,490
mentioned these not because this is the

00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,560
whole lifecycle but could but because

00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:35,599
this is where I've seen us really screw

00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,390
things up so I think these are the

00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:39,490
places where you should pay it

00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,540
developing new products cutting scope

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,370
that's the big one

00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,320
launching and then evaluating what you

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,420
just did so as we go through the talk

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,000
keep in mind like those parts of the

00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,710
cycle as useful moments to to come

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,190
either do these things or come back to

00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:55,870
them so I'm gonna cover three things and

00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:58,420
I'm gonna give you framix for each which

00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,730
is I'll be honest like sort of like a

00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:03,220
table that you can fill in so keeping it

00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:05,590
product manager in a box keeping it

00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,970
really straightforward so this is

00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,260
something you can take and use pretty

00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,710
easily but there are three things

00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:14,470
customer value containing complexity and

00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:16,270
balancing time and opportunity so let's

00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,250
talk about customer value because I

00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:22,510
think that this is this is somewhat

00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:24,880
misunderstood from a p.m. perspective by

00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:27,760
engineers and designers so from a

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,840
designer perspective usually it's I'm

00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,120
definitely not paying enough attention

00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,130
to it I'm not spending enough time on

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,070
research and generally I'm making them

00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,870
go too fast but for engineers you

00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,670
probably see little bits and pieces of

00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,950
this come through so I want to show you

00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:44,020
a couple of things that you can use in

00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:46,360
this part of the process to to refer to

00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:49,360
especially if you don't know p.m. so I

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,220
use this quote because I think that this

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,210
really captures what you just think

00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,910
about if you're trying to replicate

00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:56,470
product management work somewhere and

00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,300
I've highlighted these these parts

00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:00,880
myself but the desire to make someone's

00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:03,730
life easier or simpler and give them

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,960
what they need so just keep thinking of

00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,150
that easier or simpler and give them

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,860
what they need so that means not it

00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:11,350
would be cool if we had this thing right

00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,510
so - I always have to grab myself in

00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:15,040
that because I'm one of those PMC knows

00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:18,400
enough to be a little bit dangerous with

00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,570
this stuff so the way that we often talk

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,580
about this is through something called

00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:23,860
an empathy map and I've got three

00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,720
examples here so I think I'm gonna

00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,250
preface all of this with I think empathy

00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,440
maps are a little bit misunderstood

00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,240
because I I want to empathize with

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,400
customers and a lot of the time my role

00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,470
is to understand what customers need and

00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,080
to convey that to the organization I

00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:40,030
don't need to know everything about them

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,680
though to do that I think for design

00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:44,020
having that context is much more

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,810
important than it actually is for me so

00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:49,450
I'm going to show you three examples of

00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:50,439
empathy Maps and talk about each one a

00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,209
little bit so

00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:53,979
the first one is I'd say a pretty

00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:56,289
traditional one and the whole idea with

00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:57,999
these things is you work with a user and

00:06:56,289 --> 00:07:00,129
you talk to them hopefully you watch

00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:02,169
them use your product and then when

00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:03,909
they've done that you as you're as

00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:06,219
they're doing it as you talk to them

00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:08,259
later you record their feedback in these

00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:09,580
boxes so what they say is they're using

00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:12,069
it what they think what they do what

00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,360
they feel makes sense right and then you

00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:17,139
take this away and then figure out what

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,209
product to build the middle one is pure

00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:21,039
bugs update of this and as you can see

00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:22,899
some of it maps pretty clearly right

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,689
like you've got fields and feelings

00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:27,639
that's you know simple does and tasks

00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:29,709
those match up but then it gets a little

00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:33,639
bit different so influences I think is a

00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:35,860
really interesting one so influences is

00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:38,499
about other factors that are affecting

00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,969
your user so I think that's really

00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:41,589
interesting because it makes you think

00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:43,300
beyond your own product right so I think

00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:45,069
that's a great addition and then you've

00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,749
got at the very bottom which these are

00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:49,839
the parts that I really like personally

00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:51,849
is the product manager overall goal did

00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,909
you see there on the right which is what

00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:57,159
are they trying to do which I think the

00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:58,929
first one is missing right like what are

00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:00,339
they overall trying to do not the tasks

00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:02,740
but what's are they trying to accomplish

00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:04,509
and then the last one which is

00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,699
absolutely my favorite spoiler for the

00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:09,189
section of the talk is pain points so

00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:10,959
why is this hard for them why why is

00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:12,759
this not necessarily physically painful

00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,679
although I suppose it could be right but

00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,019
why is this emotionally painful why is

00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:19,119
this frustrating why why is this

00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:21,369
unpleasant for the person doing it and

00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:22,509
it could be something about your product

00:08:21,369 --> 00:08:24,999
that's unpleasant or it could be

00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:27,069
something about the role the job that

00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:29,169
they're working on and the final one all

00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:30,999
the way there on the right is my

00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:32,860
personal favorite so this one is a

00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:34,569
little bit different it's you can find

00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,699
on a website called strategize or calm

00:08:34,569 --> 00:08:38,740
which is actually great if you're doing

00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:40,240
you know business plans and stuff like

00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,159
that if you're starting your own company

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,779
we had a presentation about that earlier

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,100
if you're doing that kind of work

00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:46,720
they've got a lot of great templates I

00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,730
really like this one though because it

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,920
highlights to me as a p.m. the three

00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:53,139
most important things and that's on the

00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,389
far end what are the jobs what are their

00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:56,829
trying to do on the top where do the

00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:59,410
gains what makes them feel good about

00:08:56,829 --> 00:09:02,040
this what are the benefits of doing this

00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:04,240
thing and then on the bottom the pains

00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,760
so why do I like this so much well

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,890
first of all it appeals to my p.m. soul

00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,690
because it's pretty straightforward it's

00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:13,570
short it has lots of bullet points I

00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:15,940
like all of those things but I think

00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,290
that it really captures the three most

00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,330
important things to me

00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,800
when I'm trying to evaluate what to do

00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:22,600
cuz remember a lot of what PM's do is

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,950
about setting priority and saying no

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,790
we're not working on this thing now

00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,980
we're going to work on this other

00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,630
project and everyone yells at you and

00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,050
hates your decisions that's what's the

00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,560
job

00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:35,620
but the reason I like it is this it

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,529
speaks a lot to what you can sell what

00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,820
people are really gonna care about and

00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:42,100
way back when I first started working in

00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,959
tech in Boston I had this boss he was a

00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,730
general manager of our business unit he

00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:47,620
was really good in sales like he could

00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:50,770
sell anything I swear to god this guy

00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:53,140
was amazing and I asked him how are you

00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:55,380
so good at like what do you do to sell

00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,380
this

00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:19,160
[Music]

00:10:54,770 --> 00:11:00,180
like a stakeholder for me thank you that

00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:06,900
was amazing

00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:08,190
I just want to say so that's a really

00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,529
important stakeholder group if you want

00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,330
to sell stuff so always think about pain

00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:14,910
if you take nothing else from this talk

00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:18,390
think about customer pain and how you

00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:20,970
can solve it so containing complexity so

00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:24,120
this is a really tough one I think

00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,500
actually and I struggled a little bit

00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,000
because I think it's a really important

00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,860
aspect of product management that I

00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,550
don't think a lot of engineers and

00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:34,290
designers see that much of frankly but

00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:36,920
it's really hard to kind of contain it

00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:39,450
all in one single framework but I tried

00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,030
so I love this quote from Deepa char I'm

00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:44,670
not sure if the speech of a diplomat

00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:46,470
part was was how deep intended this but

00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,670
I'm going to run with that because it

00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:51,209
really did speak to me for this section

00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:52,980
so much of this role is making sure the

00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:55,170
rest of the organization is on board

00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,700
with what you're going to do because you

00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,140
cannot launch a product just as a

00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,670
product team unless you're in a tiny

00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,680
company and that like 10 person company

00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:03,450
we could totally do it but in the bigger

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,920
company you need all kinds of people you

00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:08,220
need sales who have already talked about

00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:10,110
we need we need the advocacy team the

00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,850
support team they need to be on board we

00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,800
have to get marketing on board we have

00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:16,110
to get all of these supporting

00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,060
organization that will fix the bugs sre

00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:21,600
like all of these people need to be in

00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:23,639
agreement and that's really challenging

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,470
so I was thinking about how did I do

00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:26,879
this at first because when I first

00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:29,129
became a PM as I mentioned it was

00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,600
because I was sort of fixing something

00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:31,860
that had already been built and it was

00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,360
basically because I complained about it

00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,540
a lot so they were like you can be a PM

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,540
now

00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:41,160
protip that's how you got the job and

00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:42,809
yeah so I thought a lot about how I did

00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,629
it and I realized I went back to my

00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:48,809
business school time quite a bit and I

00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:50,220
used the balanced scorecard so the

00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:52,410
balanced scorecard has been kind of

00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,819
maligned in the last while but I think

00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,309
there's some good stuff we can pull out

00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:57,749
of it the idea of it was that the big

00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:59,009
fancy expensive consulting firms

00:12:57,749 --> 00:13:00,749
basically would go into these companies

00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:02,459
and tell them what they were doing wrong

00:13:00,749 --> 00:13:04,980
and how to fix it and how to measure it

00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:07,319
and they'd use this this framework to do

00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,999
that I think it was malign not so much

00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:10,439
because it isn't useful but because the

00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:13,470
consulting companies sometimes didn't

00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:16,170
come back and explain you know what the

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,279
results meant or decide what to do so

00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,019
it's kind of gotten a bad rap but I

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,449
actually think it's pretty useful so

00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:22,740
it's got these four sections customer

00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:23,850
perspective innovation learning

00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,410
perspective internal business

00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,269
perspective and financial perspective

00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:28,920
and the idea is you sit down it's a

00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:31,829
management team and you're dealing with

00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,839
some like big like existential question

00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:35,459
for your gigantic company with this

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,379
consulting firm and you would go through

00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:40,079
each one of these and pick out goals and

00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:42,540
measures so my favorite one from

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,850
financial perspective is survive is the

00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,230
goal and the measure is cashflow so

00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,749
we're not going to quite do that for

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:50,189
product so let me start with customer

00:13:48,749 --> 00:13:51,689
perspective because that's where we kind

00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:54,149
of came from right we were talking about

00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:55,649
customer pain for me what this really

00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:57,300
means for product is how does this

00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:59,490
address customer pain so it all kind of

00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,920
comes together there and then for

00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,449
innovation and learning perspective to

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,040
me this is really about how can this

00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:06,990
product move the whole business forward

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,970
I think this is something even PMS don't

00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,829
think about enough but yet so like kind

00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:12,240
of intensely if we love our products we

00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:14,189
really want to deliver stuff for users

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,290
but what does this mean for the company

00:14:14,189 --> 00:14:19,589
I think that that's a really important

00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:22,259
question and then internal business

00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:23,999
perspective why does the rest of the

00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:25,800
organization need to care about this why

00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:27,209
should they care about this and you

00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,949
might say well that's answered by the

00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:30,540
how that moves the business for it and

00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:32,879
that's actually that's not really true

00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,860
some cases it does but in other cases

00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,110
it's like they've got more immediate

00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,880
concerns like what is this great product

00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:41,070
is going to revolutionize the business

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,080
what does this mean for my team I

00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:45,900
actually shipped something where it had

00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,400
a product ton to do with billing and one

00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,410
of my biggest mistakes in my career it

00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:52,140
was I did not talk to the billing team I

00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:54,000
didn't sell it to them we launched it it

00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,740
was awesome but then they came to me and

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,840
said you've really act as over because

00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,780
we're working like a TR weeks now

00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,520
because if your your product so don't

00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,980
don't skip the billing team I guess is

00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:07,020
my my big advice there and then

00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,300
financial perspective what does growth

00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,790
look like and how does this product help

00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,320
so I think this is another thing

00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,670
sometimes we skip over a little bit and

00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,380
we're like oh you know we can use this

00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:18,360
resources build this thing but how does

00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,950
this contribute to the bottom line is a

00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,650
really important question for PM's that

00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:24,420
we're definitely asked to answer

00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:27,750
frequently we have to worry about things

00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:30,180
like costs and an actual revenue that

00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,470
comes out of these projects or you know

00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,690
does it prevent something like churn we

00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,830
need to be able to answer that question

00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,060
so you might be asking how does this

00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:38,070
have to what does this have to do with

00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,480
containing complexity basically if you

00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:42,030
don't figure this stuff out and you

00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,940
start a project it can die just because

00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:47,040
people don't get it and not because they

00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,990
don't care or they're not as smart as

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,510
you or whatever it's because you haven't

00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:53,160
clearly articulated it and if you start

00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:55,440
with this stuff it makes it a whole lot

00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,180
easier but we can actually like narrow

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,040
this down even a little bit more because

00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,530
remember I wanted to keep it simple p.m.

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,600
in a box there are a couple of areas

00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:05,640
that overlap so one here is really

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,160
communicating to people so we've got

00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,660
customer pain and why should the rest of

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,430
the organization engage on that one

00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,220
diagonal and then this other diagonal

00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:16,710
we've got things about the business

00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,420
financial health kind of grow through

00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:21,990
the company's tragic direction what have

00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:24,090
you so if we take those out and group

00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:26,390
them together once again we have

00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:28,920
communicating stakeholder value and

00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:30,780
delivering business results so these are

00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,310
the two things that we need to focus on

00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,930
when we're trying to contain complexity

00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:35,730
internally we need to make sure we've

00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:37,830
got a really good message that we can

00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:40,590
clearly clearly communicate to everybody

00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:42,300
it might evolve a bit and frankly it

00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,470
almost always does but the important

00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,290
thing is that you have it

00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:47,880
from the start so that you can you can

00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,780
move forward with it and you can tell a

00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,970
good story

00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:54,030
because so much of these especially big

00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:56,070
projects is actually having a good story

00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,990
internally that you can tell to the rest

00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,850
of the company about why you're doing

00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:06,540
this and why it's worth their time to

00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:09,180
care so tada this is this is my little

00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:11,550
framework for this so as I said it's

00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:13,380
like a lot of tables but here's the idea

00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:15,810
and I'm actually using this now so it

00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,660
has been road-tested I've got a really

00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:22,530
big initiative going on where I work

00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:24,780
right now and for each customer I have

00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:26,760
and each group within the company I'm

00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:29,180
going through this exercise with myself

00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,260
and my team of how do we explain

00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,760
stakeholder value to these different

00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,290
stakeholders so we've actually got

00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,150
multiple lines in this so there's

00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:38,760
multiple groups of customers that we're

00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:40,260
talking about and then multiple groups

00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,450
within the company and so we go through

00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:45,600
each one and we say okay how does this

00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:46,890
have value to these customer groups does

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,690
it have value because it could be that

00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,460
in some cases someone won't care and

00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:52,620
then it's probably better that we don't

00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,990
like shove it in their face you know

00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,180
something that you don't care about and

00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,770
we can we can concentrate our time and

00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,570
attention on customer groups that do

00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,400
care our groups within the company that

00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:04,470
do you care for whom it's relevant so

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,360
that's really useful the other part is

00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,680
delivering business results so again I

00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,740
think this is one of these things that

00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:13,320
in in engineering design you may not see

00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:15,480
quite as much as we actually are exposed

00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,120
to it because what we should be doing

00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,250
here is saying to customers if we build

00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,720
this thing this is how you'll know it's

00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,190
successful and it worked and it's great

00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,140
and you could spend you should spend

00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:28,260
money on it so we need to find a metric

00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:30,000
that's important to them to change so

00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,350
that could be something about the

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,480
efficiency of their business or their

00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:35,130
cost or their time to deploy I mean

00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,410
whatever it is we need to be very

00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:39,720
cognizant of that and really understand

00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:41,940
what you know what the benchmark is like

00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,500
if we improve something by 10 percent is

00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,630
that actually significant is that

00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,150
actually a problem for people we need to

00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:50,340
make sure that's very very clear and the

00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:52,980
business results should of course be a

00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:55,080
manifestation of the stakeholder value

00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,850
so if we're saying this product is going

00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,110
to make your team more efficient we'd

00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,510
better have a metric to back that up

00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:02,700
right so just thinking through all of

00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,990
those things is really useful and

00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,490
and going through it for every single

00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,770
customer group that you think is

00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:09,750
important just kind of existentially to

00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:12,420
the business and within the company and

00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,710
being able to either either say that yes

00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:15,570
this is an important group or no this

00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:17,670
isn't is incredibly valuable as an

00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:20,130
exercise and whenever I skipped it I

00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:24,960
mess up so strongly recommend going

00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:26,520
through that that process so I kind of

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,990
filled those in a little bit all right

00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,620
so making the most of time and

00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:33,990
opportunity so this is probably one area

00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:37,380
that most of you if you're an engineer

00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:39,630
at you're very familiar with this is

00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,310
where we have our biggest disagreements

00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:43,740
you and I product and engineering

00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:46,740
because this is all about figuring out

00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,600
what we should ship and when so this is

00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,430
how I think about it and maybe this will

00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,680
give you some some insight to what's

00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:54,390
going on in our collective heads so the

00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,940
way I decided to look at this was from

00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:58,410
the perspective of this other framework

00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,890
like the balanced scorecards been around

00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:01,230
forever

00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:03,660
it's called the GE McKenzie 9 box matrix

00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:04,950
the idea of this this is again where big

00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,200
consulting firms would sit with

00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:09,390
executives and gigantic companies like

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,070
GE and they would go through all of

00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,330
their business units and say ok well

00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:15,390
which business units should be

00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:16,800
continuing to to do their thing where

00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:20,040
should we put our money where should we

00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:22,770
expect returns and so what they do is

00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,570
they use these two axes the Y roughly is

00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:26,880
industry attractiveness so how much

00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:28,740
money can we make really usually all

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,390
boils down to that and then on the

00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:33,210
x-axis competitive strength of the

00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:35,040
business unit so right for some

00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,360
inexplicable reason this is like the

00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,400
canonical this is from the canonical

00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,530
article about this and for some reason

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,750
they started on the bottom with high on

00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:45,540
the left-hand side instead of the right

00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:48,020
so I don't I don't encourage that but

00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:50,670
you know just just you know I noticed

00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:53,190
but the idea is if you're if you've got

00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:55,260
really if you've got an opportunity

00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:57,750
that's really good in the industry in

00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:59,550
the marketplace and your business units

00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,740
really strong like you've got high

00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:03,210
performers you crank workout fast do you

00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,100
think they're up for the task

00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:07,110
then you invest in it and if you're in

00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:09,810
the opposite section you will

00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:11,250
it says harvest or divest basically get

00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,810
out of there it's a bad place for you

00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,520
then you've got the section in the

00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,710
middle which is where well maybe you'll

00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,659
do it it's kind of depend

00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:21,830
zhan can you make any money from it

00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:24,080
essentially so here's how I interpret

00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:28,669
that for product so we've got our two

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,690
axes market opportunity which is pretty

00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:32,179
much the same which is all about money

00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:34,460
and team capabilities which is to me

00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:37,240
about time so this is why when I'm

00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:39,380
asking well why can't it be faster to

00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,570
market you know this is sort of where

00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:43,940
I'm coming from here because I want to

00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:46,730
take advantage of market opportunities

00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,890
and I I do think of team capabilities as

00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:50,929
really our time our resources what are

00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:54,190
we going to spend our precious dev time

00:21:50,929 --> 00:21:56,539
on so I use the nine box matrix for this

00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:58,309
so if it's in the top and to the right

00:21:56,539 --> 00:21:59,960
and I am gonna do the up and to the

00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:03,320
right is good thing on my version of

00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:05,330
this yes if it's up up into the right

00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:08,840
build it now like stop talking to me

00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:10,640
let's just build it if it's kind of in

00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:13,130
the middle for either market opportunity

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,490
to taint or team capability I'd say yes

00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:18,919
let's do it so this one's tricky market

00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:20,960
opportunity is amazing but our team does

00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:22,909
not have kind of the right strengths to

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,399
deliver it this is something to explore

00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:27,860
right we want to see like well maybe if

00:22:25,399 --> 00:22:29,690
we we gave the team some training maybe

00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,549
if we added some people maybe we hire a

00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:33,559
consultant you know there might be some

00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:36,440
things we can do to make that possible

00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:38,360
if it's in the middle I'd say find the

00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,640
fastest path to revenue how do we make

00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,860
this work for us as quickly as humanly

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,090
possible because it's kind of in the

00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,679
middle for everybody so it's probably

00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:49,600
not high priority but like let's look

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:51,679
into it and then this is a solid maybe

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,049
middling market opportunity our team's

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,820
not really in a place to deliver on it's

00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:56,480
like yeah there's probably better

00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:59,630
options

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:04,130
so let's it's a maybe everything on the

00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:06,710
bottom is no just no no no no no no this

00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:08,870
is where I I have a lot of disagreements

00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,100
with engineering because where there's a

00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,990
case where you know you're really good

00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,640
at something you know I could like crank

00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:16,340
that out and like two sprints and it'd

00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,659
be easy and I'm like no I know that's

00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,090
really frustrating but this is why

00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:22,279
because I really want us to to build

00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:23,510
stuff that people will buy so and I

00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:25,669
don't think we're necessarily doing that

00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:26,960
so this is how I think about it and this

00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:28,850
is how I work through it sometimes

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,780
appengine earring managers I don't think

00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,980
they love it but

00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:33,590
it gives them some insight into my

00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:35,540
thought process so we're running out of

00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:37,370
time let's recap the three frameworks

00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:40,160
we've got identifying customer value

00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:42,050
gains pains and jobs with pains being

00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,060
the most important critical thing you

00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:45,740
always always always forever have to

00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,350
think about if you're interested in

00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:50,150
being a PM or you work with one

00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:52,730
containing complexity thinking about

00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:55,460
messaging for all of your stakeholder

00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:57,200
groups really getting to the heart of

00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,690
what they care about to their pain and

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,460
then figuring out how you quantify those

00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,690
results for them how they will see the

00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,660
evidence that what you're doing is

00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:07,700
awesome for them and finally balancing

00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:10,010
time and opportunity so this is looking

00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:13,550
at market opportunity vs. team

00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:15,620
capability and having an honest probably

00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:17,960
very painful discussion with one another

00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,340
about what can you do in a reasonable

00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:23,900
amount of time that will yield the

00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:26,510
greatest benefit for the business so I'm

00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,980
going to go back to to this I think

00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:30,170
we've covered actually in this

00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:32,240
definition a framework for each right

00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:34,550
customer needs is about the pain that

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,440
big old circle rallying the organization

00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:38,360
behind your work is really the

00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,800
complexity part really getting the

00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,500
message down well and then finally

00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:44,270
finding a path to value is really like

00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,790
how are we actually going to execute on

00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:48,170
this so we can actually deliver it once

00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:50,090
we've got once we know what the pain is

00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:52,070
once we know what our messaging is and

00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:54,320
then you know how do we get it ready for

00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:57,230
someone to actually use and buy so we

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,850
can all still have jobs so that's the

00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:01,040
talk I think we're a little bit out of

00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:02,690
time I'll stick around feel free to

00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,640
reach out to me on LinkedIn or Twitter

00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:06,820
if you have any questions I'll be

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,470
posting these slides on Twitter as well

00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:11,970
after this talk probably tomorrow

00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:15,690
sometime so thank you so much

00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:28,999
[Applause]

00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:28,999
