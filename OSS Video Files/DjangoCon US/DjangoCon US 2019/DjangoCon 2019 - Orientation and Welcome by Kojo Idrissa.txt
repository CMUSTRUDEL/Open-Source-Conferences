you saw it in the schedule of fun hey

00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,030
this is the thing for me that I should

00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,170
come to you so again I'm glad you're

00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,920
here

00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:53,930
I am coach oh I am I do a number of

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,489
things here Django Khan I am the

00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,930
orientation chair which is why you're

00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:58,670
here now I'm also the lightening talk

00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,150
chair I'll talk about that new talks in

00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,190
a little bit

00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:04,250
I'm also the sprints chair and so

00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:07,100
sprints are Thursday and Friday so you

00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,650
kind of see me all week so that's a good

00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,270
thing or a bad thing depending I'm also

00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,100
the definite North American ambassador

00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,810
definitely is the Django events

00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,840
foundation North America so that's the

00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:19,009
nonprofit that puts on Django con us and

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,210
so in that role as a North American

00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:22,789
ambassador I do a certain amount of

00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:24,320
traveling around so even if this is your

00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:27,500
first django con you might have seen me

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,539
at a conference in your your locale the

00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,329
twitter handle for a Defen is there def

00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:33,920
nato in addition to putting on django

00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:36,200
con definite also has small amounts of

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,630
funding for django related events around

00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,119
North America and so you can either go

00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,979
to the you know to contact the DEF NATO

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:47,749
Twitter account or go to the definite

00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:51,049
org site for more information on that so

00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:53,319
orientation is an orientation for you we

00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:55,549
are focusing primarily on two groups and

00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:57,079
just a slightly we're focusing primarily

00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:59,630
on two groups here at the orientation

00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:01,219
when is new attendees so people who are

00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:03,560
either at their first tech conference or

00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:05,509
at the first django con by show of hands

00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,909
how many of you are here at your first

00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:11,890
django con ever okay all right well

00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:14,000
that's good so he I'm glad you're here

00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,460
how many of you are at your first check

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,329
conference ever

00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:19,920
okay

00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:21,989
all right so smaller number of people so

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,790
again we want to focus on you know new

00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:24,870
attendees people who might sort of feel

00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,639
overwhelmed we want to make sure that

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,439
you get the most out of your Jenga con

00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,870
experience but we're also focusing on

00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,980
anybody who might feel like there who

00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,540
might feel that they would be

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,450
uncomfortable in a setting like this

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:39,299
so as many of us know tech conferences

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:42,900
tend to skew fairly heavily towards say

00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:44,579
white men in their 20s through 40s so

00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,349
imagine for a moment if you're a white

00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:48,989
men somewhere between your 20s and 40s

00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:50,730
if you can be Django Khan and most of

00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:56,060
the people at Django con were black

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:59,159
women from in their 40s through 60s so

00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,810
one person is excited about that but if

00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:03,180
you're a white man and you're someone

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,889
your 20s and 40s and 80% of the people

00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,930
around you who are black women and

00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:09,239
there's 40s through 60s you might start

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:12,719
to think like am I am I in the right

00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:15,269
place is this because I'm looking around

00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:18,419
and it just I don't know it seems like I

00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:22,379
do Django but maybe I'm in the wrong

00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:25,229
place and so if you can be Django as a

00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:26,759
white man in your 23 40s and most of the

00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:27,720
people here were black women in their

00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:29,370
40s to 60s

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,590
I'd still be here probably doing the

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,329
orientation and I would tell you yes you

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,180
are in the right place because that's

00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:37,259
how Django con us works and so that so

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,470
this is what we do here this is where we

00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:41,939
do it Django con us and so we focus on

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,220
people who might feel uncomfortable but

00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:45,540
also partially because of

00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,129
under-representation but also just

00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,319
because you might be uncomfortable in a

00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:51,060
large group of strangers because unless

00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:52,769
you brought your entire company with you

00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,680
now you might be the only person here

00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:57,750
and so we want to make sure that you

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,009
feel comfortable and that you get off to

00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,590
the right start you'll get a proper

00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:02,790
footing as you get started you might be

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,680
trying to figure out well what do I even

00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,329
do what gang found how do i Django con

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,430
so that one of the first things we're

00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:10,530
going to talk about is the code of

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,549
conduct and I'm not going to spend a

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,259
whole lot of time going through the

00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:14,819
details of the code of conduct the link

00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:18,539
is here it is on the website you can

00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:20,159
look at it in more detail but one of the

00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:22,169
most important parts about this is that

00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:25,529
we want you to be safe and have a

00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:26,639
pleasant time at django con and if you

00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:27,870
feel that you need some sort of

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,060
assistance as relates to the

00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,040
conduct we don't want you to feel afraid

00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,639
or ashamed or embarrassed to ask for

00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,889
assistance

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,000
that's literally what it's there for and

00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:37,410
that's why we have a code of conduct

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,639
committee if you go to the Code of

00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,080
Conduct page there are people that you

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,229
can contact their numbers that you can

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,540
contact we've done all of that because

00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:46,889
we want you to be safe and to be

00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,290
comfortable and have a great time here

00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:50,970
there are two things that we just that

00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,070
you know two important things I want to

00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,930
point out one here Jango kind us we do

00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,760
not tolerate any sort of harassment of

00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,970
any any type that's just not a thing

00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:02,100
that we have here but then to more

00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,570
importantly because sometimes there's

00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,520
been some confusion or contention or

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,440
codes of conduct we don't have a code of

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,120
conduct because we want to try to catch

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,320
people and doing bad things that's

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,389
that's not what we have my code of

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,190
conduct for we have a code of conduct to

00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:15,539
help you become a better software

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,490
developer we have to help you become a

00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:21,750
better Jango not and what do I mean by

00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:23,880
that this is the reality software

00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,080
development is a difficult thing whether

00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,539
it's you know actually writing code

00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,490
testing code deploying that code

00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:31,410
Django's a web framework so all the web

00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,570
related things the HTML the CSS the

00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,760
JavaScript making it performant keeping

00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:37,500
things updated learning those concepts

00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,560
and then implementing those concepts are

00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,110
all difficult in and of itself on their

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,960
own and so why would you want to then

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:49,229
add social difficulties to that so

00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,970
you're here at Jango con us to learn

00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:53,220
more about Django or about software

00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:55,139
development or about web development we

00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,000
don't want you to have to worry about

00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:59,010
other things and this is what the code

00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,750
of conduct is for to help allow you to

00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,370
focus on becoming a better software

00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,440
developer and not to worry about these

00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,520
other things

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,370
there is often a narrative and

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,990
technology that says well when I was

00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,910
learning to code or when I was learning

00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,710
technology I had to deal with harsh

00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,780
people in harsh environments and that's

00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,220
just how learning the code is and so new

00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,449
people were learning to code also have

00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,610
to go through that because that's just

00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:23,039
how learning the code is here at Jango

00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:25,199
con us we don't agree with that we sort

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,050
of actively actively reject our

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,520
narrative and the fundamentals of

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:33,360
learning the code are difficult enough

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:37,020
in and of themselves so we want you to

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,550
be in an environment that is as relaxing

00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,770
as friendly as possible so that you can

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,240
focus on learning the actual

00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,610
technical details of whatever it is

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,080
you're trying to learn here Django Khan

00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:48,449
and so the code of conduct six that sets

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,400
the set of expectations so that you can

00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:52,770
focus your mind on those things on the

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,229
actual software development and not on

00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:57,090
other issues or worrying about how

00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:58,500
people might respond to you if you're a

00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,849
woman or if you're transgender or if you

00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,530
have a mobility issue or if you're

00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:06,960
unfamiliar to them in some way one

00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:08,129
simple tip that is useful in interacting

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,500
with folks while you here at Django con

00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:12,090
is try to avoid certain sort of what I

00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,250
call nerd humor anti-patterns

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,690
for instance one person will say oh well

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,590
hey here's this topic and it makes me

00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,599
very uncomfortable

00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,159
and the person too says oh I'm he

00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:22,680
comment about topic X haha just kidding

00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:25,949
because I was brewing ironically no

00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,360
don't do that it's not funny just don't

00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:28,789
did literally an anti-pattern you're

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,699
you're making things worse don't do that

00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:34,110
and so with that being said I'm gonna

00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:36,150
move on to focus as I said the code of

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:39,150
conduct is here to solicit to set

00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:40,469
expectations to allow you to focus on

00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,139
becoming a better Django night or a

00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:44,610
better software developer so how do you

00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:50,310
do that how do you get the most out of

00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:52,710
Django con you have to decide what it is

00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:53,969
that you want from Django con us why did

00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,830
you come what do you hope to get from

00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:58,169
this and so this of course is the part

00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,580
where it's like it's 9:30 in the morning

00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:04,159
I'm giving out homework assignments like

00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:06,479
my coche on why but it's necessary so as

00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:08,430
you're here at Django con us you have to

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,590
decide for yourself why did I come

00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,550
specifically what am I actually really

00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,240
hoping to get out of it

00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:16,650
are you looking to this learn more about

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,090
Django are you looking to learn more

00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:20,310
about back-end development more about

00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:23,490
front-end development more about the

00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:25,550
HTML CSS part are you just trying to

00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:29,159
learn as much technology as you can or

00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:31,229
are you maybe looking for a job or are

00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:32,579
you looking to hire someone or are you

00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:34,140
just looking to expand your professional

00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:35,820
network maybe you already have a job

00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,130
that you like and you should want to

00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,440
expand your professional network or are

00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,579
there other reasons you're here so these

00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,260
are questions that I can't answer for

00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:45,600
you but these are questions that you

00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:47,700
need to ask yourself why am I here what

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,390
am I really looking to get out of Django

00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,709
con us and the reason this is so

00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:55,199
important is because this will determine

00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:57,060
this this answer or this set of

00:08:55,199 --> 00:09:01,769
we'll determine what you do for the rest

00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:03,420
of the week while you're here so there's

00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:05,519
the issue of managing your schedule so

00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,660
again you look you look through the

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,040
schedule of the conference there lots of

00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,509
talks it's a two-track conference

00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,939
they're gonna be situations where you've

00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:12,720
got two talks that are lined up against

00:09:11,939 --> 00:09:14,850
each other and they both seem

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,339
interesting the question of how do you

00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,499
go to which talk your which talk to you

00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,939
goes to and and when and why that's

00:09:19,499 --> 00:09:22,920
going to be based on what's your

00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:27,180
motivation what your motivating reason

00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:29,370
for being here is and so talk selection

00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:32,009
is important but also recognizing that

00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:34,800
you don't have to go to every talk all

00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:36,029
the talks are recorded there's a certain

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,930
amount of energy management that I'll

00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:41,519
talk about as well and so you can

00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,600
determine how you go to manage your

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,850
energy and how you're going to manage

00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,499
your schedule based around what it is

00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,529
you can be do what what's your primary

00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:51,509
goal here at Jango con us is I'd also

00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:53,069
point out that the schedules on the

00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:55,079
website but then there's also the

00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:57,389
guidebook application that is available

00:09:55,079 --> 00:10:00,180
on iOS device well on most mobile

00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:01,529
devices and you can that's helpful for

00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,610
just helping you pick out what you want

00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:05,309
to do and where you want to go and that

00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:08,250
sort of thing one thing I will point out

00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:09,720
for Jengo Khan this year and so many of

00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,129
you must have your new Jango kind of 10d

00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,170
so you might not know what pattern got

00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:15,269
console-like but this year we have a

00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:17,759
slight format change normally we have

00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:20,519
talks Monday Tuesday Tuesday and

00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,170
Wednesday this year we're having talks

00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,579
all three days but the format is going

00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,069
to be different on day three on day

00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:28,019
three we're going to have a set of what

00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:30,930
are called more deep dive talks more

00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:33,629
advanced talks there was an event called

00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,709
Jango under-the-hood that happened can

00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:38,449
apply many years ago I shouldn't know

00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:41,220
that but Jango under the hood they went

00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:44,370
the toxin into much more detail about

00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:47,639
sort of the the underlying guts and

00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,720
machinery of Jango and so day three is

00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:50,939
going to be a set of talks like that a

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,610
set of more advanced talks and so that

00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:54,959
may be something to to be aware of so on

00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,850
day three the talk format will be

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,959
slightly different than it is day three

00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,339
being Wednesday will be slightly

00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:02,220
different than it is on Monday and

00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:04,410
Tuesday also I'm going to point out the

00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:07,500
idea of a hallway track and so for those

00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,279
of you who are either at your first

00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,660
janggo town or

00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:11,009
at your first tech conference the

00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,410
hallway fact is something that isn't

00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:15,449
always familiar with people the hallway

00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,670
track is basically what's happening out

00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:20,819
in the hallways when people aren't in

00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:23,160
actual talks and so the hallway crack is

00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:24,420
useful for meeting people having

00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,850
conversations that you wouldn't have in

00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,379
other places one of the one of the

00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:30,629
reasons people will sometimes optimized

00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:32,220
for the hallway track is that the

00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:34,559
conversations that you have with people

00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,759
here other janggo kind attendees those

00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:37,529
aren't recorded you can't replicate

00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,329
those in any other way the talks are all

00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:41,879
recorded you can watch those again at

00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:42,899
your leisure but the people that you

00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:44,699
meet and the connections that you make

00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:46,470
during the hallway track can't be

00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:50,910
replicated so that is something to keep

00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:53,129
in mind but it is a real thing again I

00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,360
talked to my managing your energy the

00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,220
idea that you need to sort of pace

00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,809
yourself make sure that you you are

00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:01,050
taking care of yourself you know

00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:02,790
yourself best again as software

00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,170
developers many of us tend to be

00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:06,420
slightly more introverted

00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:08,249
and so being in being on a large crowd

00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,439
of strangers can't be sort of draining

00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:12,410
on one's energy and so you know your

00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:15,500
self best you have to try to manage that

00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:17,309
but please take care of yourself I've

00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,959
one of the things I started mentioning

00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:21,029
to people last year as this prints chair

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,769
is this idea of a self-care sprint so

00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:24,480
developments software development

00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:25,949
Sprint's are important but a self-care

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,410
sprint where you take some time to take

00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:30,709
care of yourself is the only sprint that

00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:32,579
makes every other sprint sustainable

00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:35,189
I'll say that again because I think it

00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:37,800
bears repeating the self-care Sprint is

00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:40,379
the only sprint that makes every other

00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,059
sprint sustainable so if you feel like

00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:43,439
you're being overwhelmed or you know

00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:45,360
your brain is sort of taking it as much

00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:47,699
as you think you can take or you've been

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,410
around so many strangers as long as you

00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:52,740
can this take some time to take care of

00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:55,769
yourself so we have a quiet room that is

00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,300
in that it's called the PDR it'll say

00:12:55,769 --> 00:13:00,179
PDR it's the private dining room so if

00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:02,370
you go out this doorway on the on my

00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:04,679
right your left just outside of this

00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:06,720
main hall the PDR is there as the quiet

00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:09,179
rooms available if you need that or if

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,889
you're staying here in the hotel use

00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:13,019
your room use your hotel rooms a quiet

00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:14,699
room I would say if you are staying here

00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:17,819
in the hotel maybe try to prioritize

00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:19,050
using your hotel room as a quiet room so

00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:20,310
that people who weren't actually staying

00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,730
at the hotel can make you

00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:25,800
of the quiet room that's on premises

00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:27,420
also with this venue there's there's a

00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,740
lovely pool area there's an outdoor area

00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,930
so if you just sort of want to get away

00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,180
from the crowd if you feel like their

00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:35,760
crowd is a little bit too much

00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,380
San Diego is lovely and you can in San

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,820
Diego you can be outside and it's still

00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,589
very comfortable so you can go and enjoy

00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:44,820
the pool area or the outdoor area and

00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:45,240
just sit quietly and just breathe and

00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,390
relax

00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,310
and so but again you know yourself

00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:52,200
better than then the rest of us know you

00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:54,960
so please make sure you take care of

00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:58,140
yourself we also have a lactation room

00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:00,150
which is in Santa Fe 3 which is to my

00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,860
left it's probably - that's the same

00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:04,890
hallway that you use going to get

00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,600
breakfast and lunch so Santa Fe 3 is in

00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:09,600
that hallway on the right side if you're

00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,740
walking in that direction behind me also

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,660
if you start to feel like you're getting

00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,790
overwhelmed

00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,020
most people's badges have different

00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,029
stickers on them the bright green

00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:21,300
stickers are for organizers like myself

00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:23,190
and then the red stickers are for the

00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,380
ask me stickers so people who ask

00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:26,460
questions if you need help at almost

00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,200
every conference your badge is gonna

00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,000
flip around and that's just how that

00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,800
works but the colors are still visible

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,770
so if you start to feel like you're in

00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,700
over your head or out of your depth

00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:37,410
just grab someone with your appropriate

00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:41,610
colored ribbon and we will be happy to

00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:43,170
help you you can also help run django

00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,910
con if you feel like ok I'm comfortable

00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:48,180
with this I'm getting involved there

00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:49,440
volunteer opportunities this link is to

00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,810
the blog post it talks about that I

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,980
think during the introduction that's

00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:54,480
gonna be spoken about a little bit more

00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,580
but if you feel like you want to get

00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,480
more hands-on and involved that is the

00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:02,520
thing and you want to make new friends

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,930
and so there's something that's known as

00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,430
the pac-man rule like it's often just

00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:08,220
described at conferences that Eric

00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:10,310
culture of read the docs frame I think

00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,780
is the the person who popularized this

00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:14,280
the idea is that if you're standing in a

00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:17,010
set of people or with a group of people

00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,330
try to configure yourself in a pacman

00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:21,270
formation such that there's an open

00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:22,200
space so that people are able to come

00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:24,060
and join the group during the

00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,750
conversation this is how we sort of I'm

00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:30,000
more welcoming to folks here at GenCon

00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:32,630
also during lunch if you if one of your

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,009
goal is is to try to meet more people

00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,470
just try to sit with people that you

00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:37,670
don't know instead of sitting with like

00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,720
maybe you've met one or two people

00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,529
instead of just sitting with the people

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,759
that you already know

00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:42,139
try to sit with some people that you

00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:43,880
don't know that's how you can meet new

00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:48,949
people make make new connections make

00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:51,500
your friends so among other things I am

00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:54,889
also the Lightning talk share and so the

00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:57,170
Lightning talks are going to be Monday

00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:59,899
Tuesday and Wednesday during the first

00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:02,029
half of the lunch period and this length

00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:06,250
is bitly link notice the format of the

00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:09,019
link bit ly D see us for Jengo con u.s.

00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:11,149
2019 the year and then LT for lightning

00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:13,880
talks you'll see that sort of format

00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:15,920
used a few times again so with the

00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:19,490
lightning talks we have nine slots

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,350
available each day and the the sign-up

00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:24,620
sheet for Monday is unlocked and

00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:26,569
available now so you can go to that link

00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,819
and sign up for lightning talk if we

00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:31,670
have more than nine submissions in a day

00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:33,649
then I'll choose I'll curate and go

00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:35,839
through and decide which talks are going

00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:37,639
to be given you need to provide contact

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,259
information so that I can reach out to

00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:43,100
you and let you know I will point out

00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:46,130
that lightning talk slots are going to

00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:48,019
be prioritized for attendees so if you

00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,850
are someone who's speaking at django con

00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:51,500
or given a tutorial or if you're one of

00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,149
the conference organizers you'll be on

00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,889
the lower end of the priority list as

00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:56,600
far as lightning talks because we want

00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,860
to try to encourage as many attendees as

00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,420
possible to give lightning talks

00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,220
especially if you have me give me a talk

00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,630
before one of the reasons on the

00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,100
lightning talk chair is because I feel

00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:06,470
that giving lightning talks is an

00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:09,289
excellent way for people to start giving

00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:12,890
talks in general it's a it's a sort of a

00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:14,990
a lower pressure way to do that so if

00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,939
you go to that link there's a Google a

00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:18,260
Google spreadsheet we can sign up the

00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:20,059
Monday sheet is there's an instruction

00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,189
sheet the Monday sheet is open now so

00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:25,280
you can start submitting your ideas for

00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:29,600
Monday lightning talks that sheet will

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,799
close at at 11:30 today and I'll be

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,210
sending out notifications by noon

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,190
because the actual lightning talk

00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:36,559
started at 4:50 today so today it's a

00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:39,140
compressed time window but then for

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,280
Tuesday and Wednesday talks the

00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,260
spreadsheets for Tuesday and Wednesday

00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:45,470
what for instance for Tuesday we'll go

00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:46,220
live at 2:20 s or just after lunch today

00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,470
and

00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,940
then that'll be closed on 9 a.m.

00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:51,650
tomorrow morning with notifications

00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:55,870
being sent out by 11 o'clock tomorrow

00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:58,970
morning so that is that lightning talks

00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:01,760
we also have situations where we often

00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:03,080
have people from other conferences as a

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,270
North American ambassador I've been to

00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,789
many conferences in North America and in

00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:10,370
other countries and other continents so

00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:12,830
this spreadsheet is for the Friends of

00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:15,080
Django Khan and so instead of trying to

00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:17,000
have a rush of lots of different company

00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,250
organizers trying to tell you about the

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,559
conference's in in 30 seconds or 15

00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,789
seconds we've created the sheet here so

00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:25,400
that if you are someone who is

00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:26,659
organizing original or National

00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,280
Conference somewhere else and you want

00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:30,590
to share that information with Django

00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,360
kind attendees as an accomplice

00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,860
organizer you can go here and list your

00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,990
conference and information about it as

00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:39,470
someone who might want to go to another

00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:41,510
conference in wherever the conference's

00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:43,220
are again a conference is all around

00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:44,450
North America all around the world you

00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,590
can go and take a look at this link and

00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,570
see a list of some of these different

00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,919
conferences see if there's CFP just fill

00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:50,809
up in so you can submit a talk if you'd

00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:56,059
like to so that's what this is here for

00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:58,669
the friend of Django Khan now Monday

00:18:56,059 --> 00:19:00,500
Tuesday Wednesday we have talks Thursday

00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:01,760
and Friday we have development sprints

00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,799
and if you are not familiar with

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,690
development sprints then you're in for a

00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:08,030
treat but the development Sprint's are

00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:10,039
situations where people work on open

00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,940
source projects like Django and instead

00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:12,559
of having to work on them in a

00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,600
distributed manner because people are

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,400
scattered all over the world now you

00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,900
have lots of django folks in one room

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,730
and lots of other people who are working

00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,090
on other projects in one space and

00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:24,740
that's what the development sprints are

00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:26,900
an opportunity for people to work

00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,549
together in the same space on open

00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,039
source projects so the development

00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:33,200
Sprint's are Thursday and Friday you

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,850
need to register for the Sprint's but

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,990
it's there's no cost and I would imagine

00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:38,960
if you were planning to stay you've

00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:40,400
already registered I would also point

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,720
out that if you're here and if you are

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,520
someone who is planning to organize a

00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,990
sprint please try to make sure that you

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,690
are ready for new contributors do you

00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:50,059
have issues that are marked for for new

00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,620
beginners things of that nature at the

00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:53,450
sprint so this year we're going to have

00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,490
two different events to help people get

00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:58,080
started we're going to have a

00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:00,420
github camp to help people get started

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,130
using git and github and learning how to

00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,390
to do the things that you need to do to

00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,070
make contributions to open-source

00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:06,690
projects in general but then we will

00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,640
also have something being run by

00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:10,500
Carleton one of our very own Django

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,360
fellows to help people get started

00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,240
making contributions specifically to

00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,560
Django so that will be Thursday and

00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,750
Friday and those are gonna be in

00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,580
Cabrillo 1 and 2 which is the set of

00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:24,800
rooms it's closer to the front of the

00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:24,800
hotel on the left from where I am

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,150
there's more information about that get

00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:34,620
help desk that I just described here at

00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:36,090
this link on our news site there's also

00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,530
gonna be a set of social events and

00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,520
again I won't go into these in a

00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,690
tremendous amount of detail because

00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:44,250
those are going to give you discussed

00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:46,170
later but you can go to the site the

00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,700
Django find us blog and there'll be

00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,480
detail of some of the different social

00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,980
events that are happening

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,100
tonight there's going to be a welcoming

00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:54,750
party here just outside of this area so

00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:59,610
please come to that so we can welcome

00:20:54,750 --> 00:21:01,320
you appropriately and actually going

00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:03,000
through the conference there again there

00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,860
are different ways to get information in

00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,990
different ways to just sort of keep up

00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:10,680
with things keep up the changes so in a

00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:11,940
guidebook is helpful all attending you

00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,190
should have gotten an email with a link

00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,470
to guidebook so that you can get that

00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:18,750
going on your appropriate device also

00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:21,450
there is a slack channel for django con

00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:22,860
u.s. 20 or 19 again check your email

00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,300
there's a link should have been sent to

00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,630
you if you don't have that set up

00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,820
already

00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:29,580
search through emails and that link is

00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:31,470
available and if you want to tweet about

00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,510
django con which is always exciting

00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:36,840
the official hashtag for django con is

00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:42,390
hashtag django fine so hopefully is

00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:44,010
straight forward also as you may have

00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:45,870
noticed out here in the the main hallway

00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:47,700
we have sponsors here so if you have the

00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:49,650
opportunity to feel free to stop by

00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:55,200
visit our sponsors chat with them thank

00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:58,440
them so in the NVE this sort of sort of

00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,630
directed self-interest approach the idea

00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,730
is are you looking for you know maybe

00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,080
you have a job you're happy with now you

00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:06,090
might want another job as i've heard

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,560
someone say all jobs are temporary so

00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,460
maybe you need to look for your second

00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,320
job or look for your

00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,090
your third job or what have you many of

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,010
the sponsors are here and they're hiring

00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:15,570
so talk to them find out what they do

00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,760
find out what the text actually I find

00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:20,700
out if they'd be a good fit for you

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,470
at the same time the sponsor has helped

00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,210
us to keep the sticker prices low and to

00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,500
make Jango contact us as affordable as

00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:28,440

let them know that we appreciate them

00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:39,750
now this this is something that a new

00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:43,050
conference attendees might not always be

00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:45,840
familiar with I have been at two

00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:47,790
conferences in the last month or so

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,780
where they were the first conference at

00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:54,540
their type and there's this idea of post

00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:55,680
conference depression and so in so I'm

00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,780
going to share this with you on now so

00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,040
you can be prepared for it the idea is

00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,810
you're here you're at django con is

00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,130
exciting I'm going to assume that you're

00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:03,300
here at Django Kanye West because you

00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:08,520
all are interested in interested in

00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:10,320
Django yes and where you work you might

00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,820
be one of the few people who's really

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,370
interested in or excited about Django

00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,920
yeah I mean like you've maybe got some

00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:18,150
other co-workers but like you how many

00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,480
of you work at a company this like all

00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:23,490
Django all the time okay we'll see you

00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,010
guys again so for these people when you

00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:28,290
go back to work you would be like the

00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:29,430
hero when people are call you tell us

00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:31,200
about the Django kind it was so awesome

00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:33,960
share share with us your wisdoms from

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,180
Django Khan but for many other people

00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,100
you go back to work you go back to your

00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:40,140
home life and you won't be surrounded by

00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,400
Django people anymore you have like a

00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,800
week of being surrounded by Django

00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,880
people who were all like oh and you get

00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,300
back to you get home early

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,550
oh so post-conference depression is a

00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,630
real thing it happens for some of us who

00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,070
have been coming to conferences for a

00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,080
while it's a chance to see our friends

00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:57,120
and that kind of thing so I wrote a blog

00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,490
post after coming back from Python

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,260
Africa in August because that was also

00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:03,600
had many first-time conference attendees

00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,280
so post conference depression is Israel

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,710
thing you know there would be some SADS

00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,940
when you return home that's okay I have

00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:10,590
some ideas here on how you can up deal

00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,760
with it but don't be freaked out or

00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:15,810
worried about that especially for a

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:18,900
first time conference attendees so that

00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:21,410
is all I have I am I am awesome the slot

00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,940
channel my slack handle of transition

00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:25,039
you can find me on Twitter also as

00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,750
transition where you can tweet at Django

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,720
Khan or at definite if you have any

00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:31,640
questions for them so that is all I have

00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,340
once again thank you very much for

00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,870
coming to generic on us we we literally

00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,150
can't have a comments that people don't

00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:40,160
come like we s we could but it would be

00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:44,299
a terrible terrible idea they'd be like

00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:46,160
20 of us just in a big room and not

00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:50,600

00:30:32,369 --> 00:30:35,069
yep Cup they're amazing if you haven't

00:30:34,139 --> 00:30:36,839
picked them up they're at the

00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:41,519
registration desk feel free to use them

00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:43,379
but they are optional food one of my

00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:45,629
favourite topics so we provide breakfast

00:30:43,379 --> 00:30:48,359
and lunch the menus are available on the

00:30:45,629 --> 00:30:49,920
schedule and guidebook early lunch is

00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:52,890
going to start at 12:50 but that's

00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:54,660
the same time as lightning talks so if

00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:56,870
you aren't attending lightning talks you

00:30:54,660 --> 00:31:01,470
can attend lunch at 12:50 otherwise

00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:06,270
regular lunch is at 1:40 we should have

00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:08,130
a line for food two lines for most of

00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:10,560
the food and then a special designated

00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:12,450
section for vegetarian vegan and

00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:14,550
gluten-free options in the back of the

00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:16,470
pavilion there will still be other

00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:19,320
options that are vegan and gluten-free

00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:21,390
on the main lines like fruit and things

00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,160
like that but usually they'll be some

00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:26,730
kind of reserved protein or something in

00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:28,980
the back for the special diets and if

00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:30,660
nothing at the given lunch or breakfast

00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,610
