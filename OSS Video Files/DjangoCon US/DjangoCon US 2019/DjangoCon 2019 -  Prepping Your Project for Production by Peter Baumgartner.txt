	DjangoCon 2019 -  Prepping Your Project for Production by Peter Baumgartner

Django does a great job following the Python aphorism:

There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

...until it comes to production deployment. This talk will lead users through the myriad of options to a production environment that is secure, stable, and easy to maintain.
