Description: 
	DjangoCon 2019 - Nothingness and identity in Python and Django by Daniele Procida

There’s something rich, beautiful and mysterious in the several kinds of nothingness and identity that we encounter as Django programmers. Understanding the connections they make with ontology, epistemology and metaphysics adds another dimension to the joy of programming.

00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:20,650
thank you everyone and thank you to the

00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:22,550
organizers for inviting me and for

00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:25,840
organizing the conference since they're

00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:28,520
all volunteers and have been working I

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:33,020
think for the last 51 weeks since the

00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:35,000
end of the last gen gokon us very

00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,590
grateful to them because i know just how

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,699
much works involved with that so when

00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:41,530
you see a volunteer give them a

00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:43,760
thank-you or a hug if they permit that

00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:48,199
that's me that's what I look like on

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,190
television you can contact me any way

00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:51,830
you like

00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,299
I mean you can contact me on Twitter

00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:58,400
it's not something I tend to use but so

00:00:53,299 --> 00:01:01,519
that it's there I have been involved in

00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,049
Django for more than 10 years now or not

00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:06,229
involved in Django but using Django or

00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:10,310
trying to use Django I'm a member of the

00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:12,350
core development team and I'm I put that

00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,840
at embolden X vice president or the

00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,250
Django Software Foundation because

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,350
people still keep writing to me thinking

00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:22,609
that I have power which sadly I no

00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:28,509
longer have so it's nice to be thought

00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:31,219
of as past powerful I work at devio

00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:34,070
we're a company we offer cloud hosting

00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:39,710
for web projects so it just explains

00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:41,210
anybody know what DVO does well we're

00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,490
programmers so I'm sure you've all had

00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,409
the experience of banging your own head

00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:47,149
with frustration well programming well

00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:48,380
and unfortunately programmer so that's

00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:50,250
your problem we can't help you with that

00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,770
part but

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,230
even though it's frustrating I actually

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,810
really enjoy programming and writing my

00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:00,270
modest little web applications but what

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,070
I don't enjoy is the tar the other tasks

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,350
involved in getting them into project

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:07,440
into production you know deployment and

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,540
DevOps and system administration as

00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,330
anyone else had the experience of

00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:16,970
actually being made to cry while trying

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:19,920
to configure a system or a web so yeah

00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,870
it's and I was hoping I wouldn't be in a

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,070
room full of people more manly than me

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,320
who wouldn't admit to cry about that

00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,790
coming so programming in Django is one

00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,970
thing and trying to configure say

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,220
Amazon's web services is infrastructure

00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,140
for media storages is it's quite another

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,360
and that's what we do we take care of

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,620
that so you know your programming

00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,930
problems that your problems reading will

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,730
not help you with that but the other

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,450
stuff you can leave to us so that you

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,770
don't have to cry about it so it's it's

00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,560
for people who don't want to DevOps or

00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,760
crying basically that's er I think I'm

00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,290
going to talk to about our marketing

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,680
team and trying to explain why this is

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,840
what we should have on our website and

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,080
working with DVO has brought me many

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,670
many privileges and for me the most

00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,000
important one is my involvement in the

00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:08,280
african python movement and did you know

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,790
that we held the first pike on Africa

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:16,880
this summer in Accra in Ghana yeah well

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:18,989
thank you and sadly they're one of my

00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,810
co-organizers I was the only non African

00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:24,030
on the team but Noah was supposed to be

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,430
here from Ghana but I'm afraid your

00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:31,310
embassy messed up his visa and wouldn't

00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:34,290
put it right so he couldn't come but

00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:37,320
I've I think I've been to seven

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:40,530
different African pythons and now we had

00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:42,480
the first Pan African Pike on 323 people

00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,430
from many countries I'd love to talk to

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,720
anybody about this so please come and

00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:50,160
talk to me about that and maybe you know

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,650
if you're thinking that you might like

00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,350
to visit in meb or Tanzania or Ghana for

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,959
as a Python Easter then that's certainly

00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:00,090
a possibility so

00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,180
to come and talk to me about DVO about

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:05,599
deployment or any of these things right

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:09,750
let's get started maybe you know this

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:12,629
picture this is a 16th century fresco by

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:17,070
Raphael in the hissarlik palace in the

00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:20,100
Vatican and it's it's called this it's

00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:22,139
kind of subtitled that this or it's

00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,360
known as the School of Athens and it

00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:27,389
depicts thinkers and scholars mainly

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,970
from antiquity and if you don't write in

00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:34,590
in the center what you see there are

00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:38,759
Plato the old one and Aristotle who was

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:41,460
his most famous pupil and like all good

00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,880
pupils he fulfilled his duty not just of

00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,770
learning from his teacher but also of

00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,660
responding to him too and Plato's

00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,030
pointing towards the heavens

00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,070
he's referring to a world that's outside

00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:56,280
space and time outside the senses a

00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:57,960
world that belongs to pure the pure

00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,169
forms that the things in our material

00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:03,930
world are just a kind of shadowy

00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:07,860
imperfect copy of and Aristotle is

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:10,130
pointing down into the material world

00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,880
because he argues against Plato that

00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:16,440
form only exists as the form of

00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,360
substance and that knowledge and truth

00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,000
require us to generalize from the

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,199
concrete and the particular to the

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,680
universal and not the other way around

00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:28,289
as Plato argues and these two directions

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,479
to the heavens and to the earth they

00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:35,460
represent probably the most single most

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:37,440
important axis of thinking in Western

00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:41,220
philosophy and the question is you know

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,830
in which direction do we turn to or

00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,139
reach for first to these universal

00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,780
truths and ideals that might be on the

00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:51,120
census or to the material actual world

00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:54,000
that lies at our feet that presents

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,320
itself now that's not the history of

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,360
Western philosophy and don't start

00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,949
please I met thinking that I've told you

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,729
that everything in Western philosophy

00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:05,419
can be reduced to that but what I hope

00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:08,219
you can see is that this difference

00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:09,900
represents two distinct directions of

00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:11,670
thinking and you don't need to be a

00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:15,030
student of philosophy to

00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:18,110
you recognize them an interesting thing

00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:21,990
is that people generally recognize

00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:22,770
themselves in those in one of those two

00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,980
directions

00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:27,750
you know you right now will have

00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:30,800
intellectual sympathies that resonate

00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:34,700
maybe more with Plato or maybe more with

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,230
Aristotle and most people seem to know

00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,970
once it's described then which direction

00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,140
is kind of naturally theirs which one

00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,450
they weren't they were born within a way

00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,220
that and not saying that everybody knows

00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:46,140
that thinks that they are place lists or

00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,480
Aristotelian Zoar that some believe in a

00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:51,200
world of universal pure forms but that

00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:54,540
people do generally find themselves

00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:58,470
preferring and tending to think in a

00:06:54,540 --> 00:07:01,740
certain direction over the other and as

00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:03,540
I said you can see this the axis

00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,060
represented by these two different

00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:08,280
directions is a heat on a key to

00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:12,210
understanding Western philosophy over

00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:15,090
the past twenty five centuries now I

00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:18,120
started learning Python just ten years

00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:21,930
ago and I had a very memorable

00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,910
experience and last time I told this

00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:25,530
story several more than one person

00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,980
accused me of making it up and I promise

00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:30,720
you what I'm going to tell you is is

00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:32,370
exactly how it happened I swear it it

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,650
was a five day introduction to Python

00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:39,240
and Django and we were given a really

00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:41,190
nice handbook and I I practically lived

00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,510
in that handbook it was always open on

00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:45,150
my desk and you see all the marks of my

00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:47,490
espresso coffee cup so that's where I

00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:52,830
put it put it down and doing that first

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:54,630
week of our little training session I

00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,340
brought it home and I showed it to my

00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,400
girlfriend Carol and she picked up and

00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:01,590
she looked through it and she said

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,690
functions classes this is Aristotle and

00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:07,530
in a way she you know she was right so

00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:09,180
Aristotle is concerned with in his

00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:11,850
ethics he's concerned with virtue and he

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,590
argues that the defining human function

00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,940
is a rational activity and he's very

00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:17,370
interested in the relationship with

00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,990
between what a being is and what a being

00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,060
does he talks a lot about the function

00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,260
of things and I mentioned this the next

00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,349
day to the person who was giving our

00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:26,999
training who turned out not just heaven

00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:28,619
doctorate in artificial intelligence but

00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:35,399
to have studied philosophy and theology

00:08:28,619 --> 00:08:37,050
as as well and he was familiar with

00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,610
these ideas and so he and I got quite

00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,750
excited we weren't talking about this

00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,339
and they were through of my colleagues

00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:44,759
in the room with us while we were

00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:47,569
discussing you know the function of the

00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:49,620
human and the human soul and so on and

00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:52,230
my three colleagues put up with this

00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:56,490
very patiently for a while and then one

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:58,529
of them announced I'm a creationist and

00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:01,050
this talk about function and reason is

00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:05,639
making me feel really uncomfortable and

00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:07,470
I wasn't expecting that and I wasn't

00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:09,480
sure whether he was teasing me or or

00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,060
making a joke or even if I'd miss her

00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,600
and I asked him you know could he

00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,860
explain and my colleague Ben said you

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,529
needn't look so surprised

00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:23,040
I'm a creationist too and by this point

00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:27,360
my mouth was open and I wasn't feeling

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,589
or looking very intelligent and I wasn't

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,589
saying anything but my third colleague

00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:35,490
said you're outnumbered I'm also a

00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:37,230
creationist now you have to understand

00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,970
this was literally my subject I've been

00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,649
teaching philosophy at university foot

00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,810
for many years if there's one thing I

00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:44,370
knew how to do it was to help people

00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,750
pick their way through these questions

00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,120
and ideas and intelligent and thoughtful

00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,040
ways so all kinds of questions

00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,800
naturally immediately occurred to me

00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,829
like should we accept Aristotle's

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,660
account of virtue as a disposition or

00:09:54,829 --> 00:10:00,240
what should we make of his conception of

00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:04,769
function as defining activity rather

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:07,050
than his purpose and so on and I had so

00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:08,459
many of thoughts on questions like this

00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,350
spinning around in my head in quick

00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:12,420
succession but the truth is that I was

00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:14,250
so stunned that the only thing that

00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,589
formulated itself into anything

00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:20,570
resembling a coherent actual sentence

00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:23,440
was what about the dinosaurs

00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:27,710
[Laughter]

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,630
and fortunately you know I had enough of

00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:31,610
my wits left that I didn't say anything

00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,110
and also if there's one thing I've

00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,600
learnt in life is to recognize when I'm

00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:37,250
outnumbered so I was intrigued and

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,540
stunned and surprised but I didn't

00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,250
pursue the question but I've never

00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:43,690
forgotten that experience of how quickly

00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:46,610
we got from basic concepts in

00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:48,770
programming to ideas in metaphysics and

00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:51,650
ontology that weren't just important to

00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:52,910
academic philosophers but could resonate

00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,640
with people who hadn't studied this

00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:57,950
stuff and you know do things like shake

00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,120
and upset people who hadn't studied it

00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,590
and we're just listening to

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,110
conversations about it because they

00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:07,130
realized there or something profound in

00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:09,020
these ideas and shaking people is

00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:12,800
exactly what the loss of important

00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:14,660
philosophical concepts tend to do the

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,000
interesting thing is that philosophical

00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:20,150
concepts are at work in programming

00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,280
itself and we find them literally

00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:28,100
expressed in our code and when

00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:32,150
programmers are working with their code

00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:34,640
they're also working with philosophical

00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:36,350
ideas and the more I've learnt about

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,630
programming the more obvious it has

00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:41,270
become to me how deeply embedded in

00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:42,710
programming these ideas are and of

00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:45,500
course you can expect some of that

00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:47,450
because you know them logic is a branch

00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,100
of philosophy and what is programming if

00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,920
it's if it's not putting together

00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,710
sequences of logical operations but as

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,200
the case of Aristotle and functions

00:11:54,710 --> 00:12:01,010
suggests it's it goes deeper and further

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:04,670
and I think it's more interesting so as

00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:07,940
a programming beginner I was on familiar

00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:09,530
territory these this connection gave me

00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:12,860
something to hold onto as I was

00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:14,390
struggling with programming away into

00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,860
understanding programming concepts

00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:18,740
through things I was already familiar

00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:22,850
with I already knew my way around things

00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:24,830
like attributes and ontology x' and

00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:27,290
identity and truth and nothingness and

00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:29,630
so on even things like types and

00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:31,880
instances and abstract classes belong to

00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:33,880
philosophy I'm not saying I know new

00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:38,949
what those things exactly meant

00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:40,660
I could at least sing the songs using

00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:43,839
those words because you know I knew that

00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:46,470
language in philosophy that all

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,310
troublesome and contested ideas whereas

00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,449
programmers very lucky somebody's gone

00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,100
to the trouble of defining them

00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:53,800
precisely before you even get started

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:58,300
but I was used to tangling with these

00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:00,790
ideas and there was another thing that

00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:03,459
seemed very familiar and that I really

00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:05,769
enjoyed in my learning programming and

00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:07,690
still do were these kind of declarations

00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:10,990
about programming which seemed a kind of

00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:13,540
profound poetic mystery about them so my

00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:18,399
handbook said functions are first-class

00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:21,190
values and it said values have type

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,139
variables don't and this remind me of me

00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:26,790
for example of vegan Stein truth

00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:30,220
functions can be arranged in series or

00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:33,370
Immanuel Kant existence is not a

00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:35,829
predicate and I couldn't really judge

00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:38,500
whether these declarations were true or

00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:40,360
what their implications were when I

00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,100
encountered them either in philosophy or

00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,589
programming you know with a axioms

00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:48,310
discoveries necessary truths I didn't

00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:49,930
know but even if I didn't completely

00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,120
understand what they meant I could still

00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:57,839
sense there was something important and

00:13:52,120 --> 00:14:00,399
significant about them and reading

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,970
statements like these about Python for

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,500
example reminded me of how it was to be

00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:07,779
studying philosophy and the feelings

00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,370
that I had when I read them I couldn't

00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:12,279
judge whether these declarations were

00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:15,730
necessary true or false but they seemed

00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:18,459
to me to live very strongly upon a line

00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:20,980
of truth it seemed to matter whether

00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:22,810
they were going to turn out to be true

00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,519
or false or right or wrong and there

00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:26,290
were things that I didn't understand the

00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:28,839
first time or the fifteenth time I I

00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:30,579
read them but I seemed to feel a kind of

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,769
demand I come back to them again and

00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:35,380
again until I did and the things that I

00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:38,680
read about Python affected me in a

00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:40,540
similar way and when you do find

00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,819
yourself confronted with a question that

00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:46,329
seems to lie upon a line of truth you

00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:47,320
feel obliged to follow it and to explore

00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:50,500
it to work

00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:54,520
for yourself and to work out which

00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:56,860
direction to take along it and when you

00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,330
find the line of truth it seems to light

00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,910
up something in the inquiring mind

00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:02,710
something really restless and beautiful

00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,710
something that refuses to be satisfied

00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:08,200
by shallow or cheap answers and

00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:10,030
something that seems to have seems to

00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,760
recognize a kind of duty to its own

00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:14,440
intrinsic value and that was what drew

00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:17,260
me to philosophy in the first place and

00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,120
later when I was a teacher to see this

00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,620
light up in my own students and that was

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,180
one of the deepest pleasures that I had

00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:27,610
from from teaching and sometimes these

00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:29,650
kind of gloom ik assertions allowed me

00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:30,390
to feel quite superior so this is in my

00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:33,250
handbook

00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:35,820
Python correctly correctly distinguishes

00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:39,640
between an initializer and a constructor

00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:41,710
many languages like Java conflate the

00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,470
two incorrectly calling this a

00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:46,150
constructor and of course I was filled

00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,410
immediately we were kind of painful pity

00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:49,480
for the kind of people who might

00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:52,750
conflate constructor with a neutralizer

00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,700
and I swear I had literally no idea what

00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,950
a constructor might be but I knew that I

00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,750
would never be confused with the

00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:03,550
vulgarians who might confuse it with an

00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:05,260
image an initializer and this was

00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,730
another thing that I also found in

00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,950
philosophy and just the same kind of way

00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:12,010
so here's some Immanuel Kant dispatching

00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:14,770
certain critics of the Scottish skeptic

00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:16,510
David Hume Kant said they should have

00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:19,270
penetrated deeply into the nature of

00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:21,850
reason a task which did not suit them

00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:23,440
instead they found a more convenient way

00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:25,780
of being defiant without name any

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,760
insight namely the appeal to common

00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,380
sense and just by repeating those words

00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,350
to myself I would feel as though I were

00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:34,090
kind of vanquishing grubby regions of

00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:37,120
thinkers who imagined deep problems have

00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:39,370
common-sense solutions now just like I I

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,050
learned early in life to recognize when

00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,300
I'm outnumbered I know how to recognize

00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:45,160
his sentences that represent superior

00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,690
intellectual firepower you know I know

00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,690
which side to be on

00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:58,209
so when I started in programming I kept

00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,920
running into surprises that were not

00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:01,930
unlike the problems that philosophers

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,639
find themselves with when they

00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:06,100
confidently pick up something that looks

00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:09,819
familiar and simple have a close look at

00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:11,500
it so some of you are familiar with

00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:14,500
children or may even have some of your

00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:18,179
own but even a child learns to use with

00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:22,809
confidence simple words like nothing

00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:25,809
what's going on I think and we use these

00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:27,880
concepts and words dozens of times a day

00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:29,679
not just in speech but in the thinking

00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,390
that represents and orders the world

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,760
around us and we do without hesitation

00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:36,130
and we do it without doubt nothing is

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,950
just the absence of something but just

00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:40,210
as in philosophy nothing starts to look

00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:42,520
more troublesome when you look at it

00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:44,770
more closely the programmer has to deal

00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,679
with nothing runs into similar

00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:48,820
complications so one of the most common

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,789
things that I would had to do as a

00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:53,890
programmer would be to check for the

00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:55,780
absence of something and all of a sudden

00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:58,210
it was a complete marvel to me how many

00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:00,700
different kinds of nothing could exist

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:03,820
in programming and I had to deal with so

00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:06,280
many of them there was none and there

00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,659
was zero and there were empty lists and

00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,990
sets and other collections there was the

00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:12,730
empty string then in Django there was I

00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,710
discovered a new kind of nothing null

00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:16,539
for the database and then blank for the

00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:18,010
forms and there were all different kinds

00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:19,650
of nothing and they were all different

00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:22,480
from each other

00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:26,140
so in the Django applications I was

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,210
building I needed to represent the world

00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:30,549
to construct a picture not just of its

00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:32,980
material and of the stuff in it but of

00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:37,270
the worlds logical form its logical

00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:38,740
structure and here nothingness was

00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,510
everywhere everywhere I looked it turned

00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,250
out to be key to the logical structure

00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,530
of the representation of the world I

00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:47,440
always started thinking about what was

00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:50,020
in the world the stuff in it and always

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,480
found myself running up about problems

00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:54,730
not about stuff but about the absence of

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,860
stuff how critical nothing turned out to

00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:58,570
be to the logical representation and I

00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,220
found myself being obliged to spend a

00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,220
lot of time making decisions about

00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,710
nothing and

00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,990
how to handle nothing and I was working

00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:08,419
at Cardiff University School of Medicine

00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:10,340
then and one of the things my web

00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:12,740
application needed to do was to be able

00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,340
to represent the members of staff who

00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,200
worked there

00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,299
record them and information about them

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,220
and display them in detail and then

00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:21,470
lists and so on so I needed to be able

00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:25,220
to represent actual people from the

00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:29,840
world and I needed a person model do

00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:39,559
this in Django so I had actual persons

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:43,070
and I need to have an adequate account

00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:44,659
of persons in my own Lodge my own mind

00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:46,460
in my own logical representation of the

00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:48,980
world I needed to have it in my Django

00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:51,470
models in the database where I'd store

00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:54,020
them in the forms and in the output

00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:56,000
where I'd display them and all these

00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,700
different kinds of nothingness that I

00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,890
encountered made not just one different

00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:03,740
but different kinds of difference in all

00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:08,090
these different representations so just

00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:09,890
think about a name for a person in the

00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:12,020
parts of names that people have which

00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:14,000
parts of a name can be non-existent and

00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:16,280
how do you code or or allowed for that

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,020
what what nothingness will you allow in

00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,360
the name on what combinations of

00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,820
nothingness how will that nothingness

00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:25,010
affect how you display them or list them

00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,390
or order them or filter for them say

00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:28,909
you've got to display the list of people

00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,870
in a certain department and after a

00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:31,429
while you realize that it's not just

00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:34,400
representing the world you're you're

00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:35,990
building a world out of logic and it's

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,549
quite a responsibility and after a while

00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:40,730
I started to feel very sympathetic

00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:42,020
towards God I'm British I was really

00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,700
quite sure that I understood the

00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,980
difficulties that God faced when he was

00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,480
making the world and I'm the kind of

00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:51,049
person who appreciates how hard other

00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,429
people's jobs can be so I felt that he

00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:55,760
and I must have been in the same kind of

00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:59,030
business at some level and names provide

00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,100
us with some excellent examples of the

00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:02,539
problems that nothing causes us because

00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,840
they start out looking pretty simple but

00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:04,840
you know

00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:12,210
I I confess I already found sting a bit

00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:15,360
irritating people before I became a

00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:17,130
programmer but as I was aggrieved but

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,690
ultimately not really surprised to

00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:22,530
discover that he could be annoying in a

00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:24,030
new way um so as a program under God

00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,260
builder of my world and it could be up

00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,760
to me to say well no sting I think

00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,050
you're on you're having one name is

00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,710
pretentious and I'm not going to allow

00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:33,390
it and you'll have to use your a name

00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:36,750
like like the normal people do

00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:39,660
tough luck sorry but on the other hand

00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:41,640
this is president Sukarno of the first

00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:44,790
president of indonesia and like many

00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:48,810
Javanese he only had one name he didn't

00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:50,700
have a family name this is very common

00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:54,660
and in fact I discovered the other day

00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:56,550
that Tim he had nine times as many wives

00:21:54,660 --> 00:22:03,600
as he had names and that maybe there is

00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:05,730
a record for a president so all you know

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,890
i felt quite casual about denying sting

00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:10,430
the right to have just one name but it

00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:12,660
didn't seem fair on on all the Javanese

00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:16,230
and so what could I do about that well

00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:19,200
you know you can take a count of it in

00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:21,150
your Janko model by allowing null equals

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,410
true but that's still not enough you saw

00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:24,330
need to have a different kind of

00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,750
nothingness for the forms and it's still

00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,830
not enough

00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,480
because I still need to deal with this

00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:30,360
nothingness correctly when it comes to

00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:32,580
the work of filtering or in my output so

00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,840
we should Sukarno live in my list of

00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:38,250
persons when I display them

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:40,520
alphabetically and so it goes on nothing

00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:43,620
turns out to be an awful lot of work and

00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:45,900
complex work because nothing this isn't

00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:47,940
just a simple business it touches

00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,390
everything and affects everything it

00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,220
touches

00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:52,220
nothing really does matter

00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:03,400
now in programming I found another

00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:07,780
abiding fascination on the other side of

00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:11,080
nothingness and negation in being and

00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:13,370
you know being is to identity as

00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:16,040
nothingness is to negation just as

00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:19,640
negation has its origins in nothingness

00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:21,830
so identity has its origin in being and

00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,740
both being an identity have they're

00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:27,550
there they lie in the verb to be and

00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:30,380
once again even a child very early on

00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:34,360
learns to use that verb correctly and

00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:37,340
and and in accordance with the norms and

00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:40,220
so does the Python beginner when they

00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:43,310
start doing their Python and they use

00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:45,410
these notions in simple and successful

00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:47,390
ways so the new program will have will

00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:50,620
have rarely been told that is refers to

00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:54,950
identity whereas the Equality operator

00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:57,380
refers to equality but in ordinary

00:23:54,950 --> 00:24:02,030
language we can say things like 7 and

00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:03,140
plus 7 equals 14 or 7 and 7 is 14 and

00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,360
there doesn't seem to be too much

00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:09,170
urgency about distinguishing between

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:11,330
these things and first often it will

00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:13,460
seem to work in ways that you'd expect

00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:17,450
and everybody everybody's very happy

00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:19,400
about that until they do something that

00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:26,750
looks or they thought look the same and

00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:32,450
then it doesn't work and they can

00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:35,030
continue to run into puzzles in which

00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:39,320
their expectations built on apparently

00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:41,480
similar outcomes sorry yeah which

00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:44,390
they've seen apparently similar outcomes

00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:53,740
of apparently similar operations built

00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:53,740
up things like that's okay

00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:04,260
I messed up my own slides we kind of

00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:04,260
messed up my slides of it

00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:22,470
yeah so they will they will run into an

00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:23,610
unexpected result you might say that you

00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:26,130
know maybe those two things are only

00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:28,500
superficially similar I think actually

00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:31,770
that the similarities are quite deep

00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:33,720
only human human would notice them but

00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:36,260
the computer doesn't and and the problem

00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:39,690
what they're running into is pythons

00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:41,160
internal metaphysics of being which will

00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:43,230
catch them out again and again until

00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:46,910
they fully internalize it so here's

00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:50,040
another example where we have some

00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:52,200
operations and some operations that

00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:56,160
maybe look similar and we're still happy

00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,930
about that and still looking all right

00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,820
and then all of a sudden they run into

00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:05,960
something that is like a car crash in

00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:08,070
their in their logic because does it

00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,530
maybe I should explain this a little bit

00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:13,560
so in the first example in the top left

00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:15,390
if you do assign a hundred to two

00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:19,260
different variables a and B and then

00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:20,460
asking is a B so yes it is and here

00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,710
we've done exactly the same thing with

00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:25,530
two other numbers and although they're

00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:27,210
equal they're not identical and that's

00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:29,520
because internally Python represents

00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:32,550
numbers bigger than 256 differently from

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,800
the way it represents numbers smaller so

00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:36,510
there's this stuff going on at this deep

00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,790
level and if you don't internalize it

00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:40,380
you will run into this what you thought

00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:42,990
or what they thought they were asking

00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:44,610
wasn't what they were really asking and

00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:47,190
in ordinary language you might get away

00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:49,340
with it but in the terminal you don't

00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:51,300
and there's just more of it then this is

00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:53,010
there's some really fun stuff yeah I

00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,300
think this I think this is fun I think

00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:56,940
there's a certain kind of fun to be had

00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,650
in exploring this stuff at least for a

00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,910
certain kind of person you know when

00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,830
you're by the time you get to this

00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:04,200
little second last line you think what

00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:06,930
on earth is happening there but it all

00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:10,500
hangs together and it's pythons internal

00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:14,880
metaphysics so we use this all without

00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:17,550
hesitation in ordinary life but in

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,400
philosophy we spilt vast amounts of ink

00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:24,060
trying to understand those concepts

00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,660
anything unnecessary fuss around such

00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,840
small

00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:29,160
as is and not and people lose patience

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,980
with philosophers when they seem to be

00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:34,200
making a big deal out of simple easily

00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:37,170
understood things and they people don't

00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,970
like it and you can understand how the

00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:42,990
appeal to common sense can seem

00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:47,670
attractive especially when you know

00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:50,600
you've got people making big complicated

00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:54,690
foreign sounding words about ordinary

00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:58,650
ordinary ones and even worse when you

00:27:54,690 --> 00:28:01,320
have a president also indulging in

00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:03,120
quibbling about the meaning of the the

00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,950
word is it depends on what the meaning

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,410
of the word is is so even if you're

00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:09,300
actually sincerely interested in the

00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:10,830
meaning of the word is this was not

00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:13,050
really a very good look and the fact

00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:15,510
that he was visibly squirming and sweaty

00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:20,250
didn't make it much make much better him

00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:21,870
so unfortunately for us the Python

00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:24,480
interpreters were more patience than

00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:26,640
grand jury and no powers of

00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:30,090
understanding either so we had better be

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,520
sure that we in the interpreter agree on

00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:36,030
the meaning of the word is whenever we

00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:39,510
use it and we better understand pythons

00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:41,310
internal metaphysics of being so I want

00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:44,370
to return again to the question of Plato

00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:45,780
and Aristotle Carroll was really happy

00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:47,790
to read about functions and errant

00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:50,910
attributes in Python because it reminded

00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:52,530
her Aristotle and Aristotle has a lot to

00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:54,480
say about them but since we've been

00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:57,960
contrasting Plato and Aristotle let's

00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,600
have a little look for Plato our

00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:03,000
attention should be turned towards the

00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:05,250
ideal forms of things because the actual

00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,590
things now world here in our world of

00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:11,000
senses they're just mere shadows or

00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:13,380
imperfect copies of those forms a

00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,600
triangle is only a triangle because the

00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,580
ideal form of a triangle exists

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,510
somewhere in a realm of forms the form

00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:23,760
came first and that's what makes the

00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:25,500
instances possible but for Aristotle on

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,410
the other hand we have to start with the

00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:31,550
concrete particulars and form only in

00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:33,740
here's in those particular objects and

00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:36,080
it's only

00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:39,970
through those objects that we are able

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,970
to discern the generals the universals

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,110
so for Aristotle triangles and triangle

00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:47,090
nurse both exist but the form can only

00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:50,120
be found in actual examples of triangles

00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:59,350
and for me this I discovered this align

00:29:50,120 --> 00:30:01,580
nicely with another distinction the

00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:07,210
object-oriented programming that we do

00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:09,620
in Python is class-based but class-based

00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:11,480
programming is not the only kind of

00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:16,299
object-oriented programming

00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:19,070
so JavaScript uses prototype based

00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:21,230
programming so in class-based

00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:23,390
programming we define abstract classes

00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:25,580
that we instantiate as objects so we go

00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:27,380
from the abstract the concrete but in

00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:30,620
prototype based programming we create

00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:33,890
concrete objects that we then clone in

00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:36,649
class-based programming we make new

00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:39,890
things from other things that then

00:30:36,649 --> 00:30:43,669
inherit from existing ones but in

00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:46,130
prototype based programming new things

00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:50,390
are objects that inherit inherit from

00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:52,789
existing objects so in class-based

00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,470
programming as in Plato the ideal form

00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:57,200
of an object that blueprint the class

00:30:54,470 --> 00:31:00,020
that defines it exists in and of itself

00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,110
whereas for Aristotle or prototype based

00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:08,330
programming the general form only exists

00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:10,940
through the concrete objects which means

00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:15,260
that Plato is to pythoness Aristotle is

00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:16,940
to JavaScript and so Carol is wrong when

00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:19,070
she said it was Aristotle it was Plato

00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:20,899
really but she wasn't a programmer so

00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:24,470
she didn't know and I didn't know this

00:31:20,899 --> 00:31:28,340
until quite recently again with Plato

00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:29,929
and Aristotle and Plato's pointing

00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:32,149
upwards for the source of truth the

00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:33,860
realm of ideas and the abstract and

00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:36,080
Aristotle's referring to the concrete

00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:38,419
world at his feet and to say that one is

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,580
right and one is wrong is not the point

00:31:38,419 --> 00:31:42,679
but I think it's a difference that kind

00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:47,649
of demands that we take sides in some

00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:47,649
way and most of Western

00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:59,380
yeah most of Western philosophy seems to

00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:02,620
have been the history of taking sides on

00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:04,360
this and any debate right now for

00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,310
example between a pragmatist and an

00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,830
idealist can also be overlaid on this

00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:14,050
I'm not saying that a modern idealist or

00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:18,100
pragmatist is a blatant playfulness

00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:20,530
store an Aristotelian just that you can

00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,060
see how these things line up that you

00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,250
can see in the two different approaches

00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:26,050
the two different ways of thinking

00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:28,030
directions of thought they're clearly

00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:30,670
aligned and fit with those of them right

00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:32,350
on one side or Aristotle on the other so

00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:34,090
they live 25 years ago but there are

00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,890
ideas are still alive and kicking and at

00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:37,740
work and we can engage with them and I

00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:40,690
love that and for people who are a bit

00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,950
argumentative like like me it means you

00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:44,140
can have an argument with someone who

00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,790
dies two-and-a-half thousand years ago

00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:49,660
and what's more they're still answering

00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:52,270
back so let's go back to this question

00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:53,980
for their final time of Plato and or

00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:56,830
Aristotle which is the one for us which

00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:58,900
is the one that speaks most directly or

00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:02,560
deeply to us and that in a way up to us

00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:09,340
answers for this one is I don't have to

00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:11,130
choose it depends a bit on my mood

00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:15,400
because sometimes the answer is Plato

00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:18,160
obviously so here for the very last time

00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,970
his Plato and Aristotle on the walls

00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,820
they're kostelec

00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:22,900
palace all eyes on them Center attention

00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:25,870
around which everything else is

00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:28,630
revolving pointing up and pointing down

00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:31,450
and his John Travolta in Saturday Night

00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:33,040
Fever and all eyes are on him he's a

00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:34,810
center around which everything revolves

00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:38,870
and he's also pointing up and pointing

00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:42,920
down at the same time

00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:47,120
and the two directions that John

00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:48,740
Travolta gives us is give us a line and

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,990
it's a line of truth he's giving us

00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:52,850
dimension we can choose a direction on

00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:54,590
that line but we don't have to the

00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:57,020
important thing is not that you have to

00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:59,570
choose and declare this direction to be

00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:01,430
yours but to be aware of that dimension

00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:03,380
and like John Travolta that dimension

00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:06,170
contains both directions at once

00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:08,060
and we must live on this dimension we

00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:10,370
must find our way up on this line of

00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:12,560
truth and as I said before when you find

00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:14,780
yourself confronted with something that

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,240
seems to be a line of truth you feel

00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:21,260
obliged to follow it and explore it to

00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:25,400
work out for yourself which direction to

00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:28,520
take along it and that was the the force

00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:31,250
of the demand that I felt in philosophy

00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:34,250
to respond and demand so to respond and

00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:37,100
engage with the kinds of demands and

00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:38,930
questions that they raised and the

00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:41,090
interesting thing for me is that of all

00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:43,340
the people I've met in the world the

00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:46,700
ones who respond most strongly to those

00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:48,620
questions are programmers and I don't

00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:51,650
know why maybe it's because people who

00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:53,420
become programmers are already disposed

00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:55,640
to being alive to those questions or

00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:57,830
maybe programmers does something to

00:34:55,640 --> 00:35:00,110
people and changes the way they think

00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:01,480
and it's not just that they're alive for

00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:04,550
these questions they also seem to be

00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:06,500
well equipped to tackle them I've never

00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:11,450
met any other population of people who

00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:14,540
can including academic philosophers who

00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:17,230
can think and talk about philosophical

00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:19,790
questions as intelligently and wisely as

00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:21,410
programmers can and annex it's an

00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:23,420
experience I've had again and again

00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:25,910
there's something in programming that

00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:28,010
gives people insights into certain kinds

00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:31,180
of philosopher philosophical questions

00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:35,920
and a clear grasp of certain concepts

00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:35,920
and the conversations

00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:39,440
the conversations that I've had with

00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:42,259
programmers about these things have been

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,089
consistently more enjoyable and

00:35:42,259 --> 00:35:45,499
rewarding the ones than the ones I've

00:35:44,089 --> 00:35:47,930
had for example with students or

00:35:45,499 --> 00:35:51,319
colleagues even or as enemies as I like

00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:53,210
to refer to them in academia and I'm

00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:54,769
sure that if programmers became

00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:58,099
philosophers they'd have something

00:35:54,769 --> 00:35:59,150
really worth something to say that would

00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:02,239
would be worth hearing

00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:03,829
so here's Immanuel Kant treatment of

00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:06,170
nothingness in the critique of Pure

00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:08,150
Reason and honesty of you should maybe

00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:10,789
read it one day it's equal in technical

00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:13,519
rigor and depth to anything that a

00:36:10,789 --> 00:36:15,559
programmer could think of and I would

00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:18,109
love to see a programmer rather than

00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:21,470
some lazy philosopher get their teeth

00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:24,109
into a philosopher programmer get their

00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:27,289
teeth and into something like that or

00:36:24,109 --> 00:36:30,829
this is his analysis of judgment which

00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:32,930
he describes as logical a judgment is a

00:36:30,829 --> 00:36:34,579
logical function of unity for campuses

00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:37,369
that work functions again and I'm sure

00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:38,829
that a programmer philosopher would have

00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:41,299
something more valuable to save them the

00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:43,309
mountains of rubbish I've had to read

00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:44,450
including you know and I'm not talking

00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:46,069
about students essays I'm talking about

00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:50,380
books I went out and bought with my own

00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:57,609
money from people have fortunately never

00:36:50,380 --> 00:37:00,109
met for them and there are so many

00:36:57,609 --> 00:37:02,529
places to go and things to think about

00:37:00,109 --> 00:37:05,539
that are connected directly to these

00:37:02,529 --> 00:37:10,210
concepts in programming so we have been

00:37:05,539 --> 00:37:12,829
in nothingness and substance

00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:15,249
consciousness or identity and negation

00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:17,450
or equivalence and difference or

00:37:15,249 --> 00:37:20,450
positivity that is you know what

00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:24,529
actually is a normativity which is what

00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:27,880
should be or object hood versus becoming

00:37:24,529 --> 00:37:30,529
and these all lie there on that

00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,119
distinction between Being and

00:37:30,529 --> 00:37:36,589
Nothingness

00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:41,499
and this goes wider and further and

00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:41,499
deeper maybe then you imagine

00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:47,950
Plato argued that until philosophers

00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:50,220
become rulers or kings or four kings

00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:53,170
become philosophers are truly just

00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:54,700
society would be impossible well I've

00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:56,380
seen how philosophers manage to run a

00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:59,260
philosophy department so I don't have my

00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:00,640
hopes up for the philosopher King and I

00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:03,070
have to admit that when you know 30

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:06,090
years ago when I was a young academic I

00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:09,790
found it quite an attractive notion but

00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:11,350
with a bit of distance the ideas come to

00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:14,260
seem a little bit more little less

00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:15,520
implausible on the other hand we could

00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,960
have programmer kings and I think No

00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,000
thank you very much I wouldn't wouldn't

00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,480
mind that very much either

00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,070
a program has already have more power

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,290
than I think is safe to have in their

00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:27,760
hands because their ways of thinking

00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:31,420
programmers ways of thinking are

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:33,250
responsible for they find expression in

00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:35,910
the construction of our world they are

00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:38,350
responsible and in becoming increasingly

00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:41,740
responsible for the way we live in the

00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:43,000
way we communicate and so on and we can

00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,620
talk about that another time but I don't

00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
think there's any evidence to suggest

00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:49,600
that they'd be better Kings than

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,160
philosophers would be but on the other

00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,770
hand the idea of program of philosophers

00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,640
I think that is something else

00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:56,620
programmers are made for this I think

00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,330
they're genuinely good at it and I find

00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:01,330
it nothing less than fascinating that

00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:03,310
they are and I continued every time I

00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:06,090
meet them to have these fascinating

00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:08,290
encounters with programmers that

00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:11,380
illuminate and that had new dimensions

00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:13,630
to the philosophy that I studied for so

00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:16,630
many years and that has been one of the

00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:20,710
most important things in my life for

00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:22,840
most of my life so to the programmers I

00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:25,360
just say um thank you for all the

00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:28,620
conversations and I hope that we will

00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,620
have many more

00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:40,040
thank you very much Daniele I'm always

00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:41,030
entertained when I say your talk you

00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,890
mentioned you so you talk about

00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:44,660
philosophers and programmers as if they

00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:46,430
are two distinct groups would you think

00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,870
there is benefit in hope people who are

00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:49,760
programmers I know that I didn't mean

00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:51,730
some kind of philosophy until a PhD

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,320
program and even then reluctantly

00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:56,090
learning is there it would be benefit in

00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,420
programmers spending more time reading

00:39:56,090 --> 00:40:00,890
philosophy either to inform the decision

00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:03,020
making process around the ways we're

00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:04,010
ruining the world or to understand the

00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:06,380
programming they're actually doing

00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:08,090
better actually that's a really

00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:14,180
interesting question and I was thinking

00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:17,750
about this the programmers tend to be

00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:18,980
smart clever fast thinking people but

00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:21,110
they don't always have the opportunity

00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:25,160
to become very deep thinkers about

00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:27,560
things and this is why so many of the

00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:30,110
things that programmers come up with

00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:33,290
when they for example have a social

00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:35,120
implication looks so horrendous you know

00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:38,900
what looks like a really smart idea to a

00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:43,370
clever 23 23 year old isn't necessarily

00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:45,650
very wise or or or profound and I think

00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:49,030
perhaps that might be a dimension that

00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:50,870
the study of philosophy has to offer for

00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:52,730
programmers whether it would make their

00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:55,490
programming any better you know I don't

00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:57,680
think it's I don't think it's made me a

00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:58,640
great programmer or you know maybe

00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,740
there's another reason why I'm not a

00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,870
great program but I think it would

00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:04,060
certainly be valuable to their thinking

00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:06,380
yes

00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:08,630
so there's a difference between being a

00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:13,540
fast smart to have a person being

00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:13,540
somebody who is a profound thinker

00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:21,790
any more question all right let's give

00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:25,060
another round of applause to mr. Daniele

00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:38,369
[Applause]

00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:38,369
