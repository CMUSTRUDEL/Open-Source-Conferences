	DjangoCon 2019 - Understanding Django authentication by Renato Oliveira

Django gives us a built-in authentication system. It's an awesome asset for doing web development strictly with Django, but when you try to do something else, you’ll need to integrate with other options. Understanding it at a base level makes more advanced authentication systems easier to implement.

[Music]

00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:20,360
so hi everybody how are you today it's a

00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:23,110
recurrent incredible honor to be here

00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,670
and to give my first talk at Django calm

00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:27,740
and like my coworker and it's got Nicole

00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:32,510
used to say I'm I look nervous but don't

00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:34,280
worry it's just because I am okay so

00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:37,820
let's say you want to buy a piece of art

00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,280
I never bought famous art but I suppose

00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,110
you should go to an art dealer okay so

00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,970
you talk to your person and they show

00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:47,269
you a painting from a famous artist and

00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:49,699
it's real expensive and you don't want

00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:54,830
to put so much money in something that

00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:57,409
you not sure it's true or not so you

00:00:54,830 --> 00:01:00,559
start making questions who owns it who

00:00:57,409 --> 00:01:03,260
made it and how can you prove and then

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,540
you're a dealer start showing documents

00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:09,830
that prove it proves the painting

00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:13,280
provenance so it was bought from

00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:17,359
somebody couple years ago before that it

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,299
was exposed in this famous museum it was

00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:23,899
found at some point because it was

00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:25,729
declared lost many years ago because the

00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:29,000
painters sewed to somebody that didn't

00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:31,399
care that much about art and then voila

00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,289
here's the actual Instagram post by

00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:39,289
Salvador Dali bragging about the

00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:42,409
persistence of memory so what we just

00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:44,539
did or kind of was to get the provenance

00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:47,060
of a piece of art this is the chronology

00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:50,270
of the ownership of a historic object

00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:52,700
and it takes into account many different

00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:55,069
attributes to prove the provenance they

00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:58,159
are sensitive of a piece of art things

00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:59,950
like who has the work the artist when

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,270
and where it was the painting was made

00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:06,350
how it was made and where it was

00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:08,539
exhibited and so event occasions not

00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:10,340
something only related to digital in

00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:13,220
fact there are different types of

00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:16,490
authentication in Windgate sorry we can

00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,050
take a look on their next so in this

00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:21,379
talk we'll cover

00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:23,599
authentication types and factors the

00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:24,500
authenticated function authentication

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,610
backhands

00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:30,860
logout in sessions but first my name is

00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,870
Janet Oliveira and I'm from the city

00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:36,560
here hissy-fit probably did not the

00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:39,290
first one that you saw here it's an

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,450
oasis city in Brasilia northeast and you

00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:44,570
should go there if you wanna like take

00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:46,520
vacations and I'm a co-founder at lab

00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:48,290
codes and my day job is basically to

00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:52,640
complain that I'm not coding as much as

00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:54,860
out like in the organizer the few

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,290
conference in Brazil from local meetups

00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,730
to even Brazilian PyCon and I know how

00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,440
hard it is to put together a conference

00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:05,390
like this or like to thanks the

00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:07,310
organizing team for that and I'm a proud

00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:09,650
member of the Python user group from my

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:12,280
state and I've been working with jungle

00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:15,050
for almost a decade

00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,090
little but lab codes were softer studio

00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:19,190
based in Brazil and we specialize in

00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,150
creating custom web products fitted for

00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,490
specific needs

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,260
we believe that software should be built

00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:26,630
by fulfilling clients and users expect

00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,370
Asians and our software is always aim it

00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,760
at solving problems in optimizing

00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:33,530
process it's an order owner for me and

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,870
for the team to be here speaking in

00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,269
sponsoring and I'll be here to all the

00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:43,910
screens and more ting happy to talk

00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:45,950
about what we do and like I said before

00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,720
I work with jungle for almost a decade

00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,940
and I've created my share of

00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,160
authentication system single sign ons

00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,830
custom authentication I've integrated

00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,290
with many third-party apps through off

00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:59,030
of queue and others and every time and

00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,010
every time I need to do something

00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:05,660
different I need to research all over

00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:07,430
again so ok sorry authentication is not

00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:10,040
something like storing a record in the

00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:13,190
database using a template tag or

00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:18,470
creating an API endpoint if you really

00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:20,780
do that once per project and if you work

00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,640
for the same company in the same project

00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,050
since you've learned how to jungle the

00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,680
change that you've implemented it once

00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,290
or Never

00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:31,400
are high so hopefully this talk will

00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:34,160
help us to remember it in the future and

00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:37,039
a little disclaimer here I'll show some

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,980
code because it's a deep dive talk but

00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:40,830
I've got something

00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:46,230
from some things off to try to be more

00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:48,690
direct to the point so authentication is

00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,670
the process or actions action or probe

00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:53,910
of providing or showing something to be

00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:55,980
true genuine or valid and like we just

00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,050
saw it's not something only related to

00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:01,260
computers in fact there are three types

00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:03,390
of authentication the first type is

00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:06,060
accepting the proof of identity by a

00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:08,460
credible entity it can be a witness a

00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,010
reliable friend or our certificate

00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:15,300
authority here the authentication is

00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:18,090
implied so for example a product being

00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,160
sold by a known vendor implies offense t

00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:24,510
but even though they are not aware of

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:27,210
all steps of the supply chain the second

00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:30,330
one is comparing the object attributes

00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:32,700
with no attribute from their origin kind

00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,610
of the depth typing of authentication

00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:37,890
and like an art expert might look at

00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:41,370
painting style location in a form of the

00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:44,670
signature also bills authentication is

00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:47,450
done by comparing attributes the tell

00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:49,980
type relies on external formations or

00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:54,060
documentation like a password store in

00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:55,770
the database or even my passport some

00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,540
products like medicines they need to

00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:01,830
take all three types of authentication

00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:03,870
to prevent counterfeit so when talking

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,690
about electronic authentication we can

00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,520
use different factors to establish

00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,290
digital identity and there are there are

00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,720
three categories of authentication

00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:15,540
factors in their January book broken

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,280
down as so knowledge factors is

00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:20,400
something that the user knows like a

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,140
username or password possession factors

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,480
is something that the user owns like a

00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:27,360
smart card or security token or a mobile

00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,280
device and inherence or biometric

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,280
factors it's something that the user is

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,940
like a fingerprint a voice or RF iris

00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:38,310
pattern single factor authentication is

00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,990
based in only one category

00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,850
the most common single factor

00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,710
authentication method we have is the

00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:45,720
combination of username and password

00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:49,680
it's something that the user there is a

00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,660
nose but for more critical systems with

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,060
containing sensitive data

00:06:51,660 --> 00:07:00,240
important to add additional factors to

00:06:54,060 --> 00:07:02,460
establish the security so whoop affects

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,470
our mood sorry mood pop factor

00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,960
authentication involves two or more

00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:09,660
independent credentials for more secure

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,510
transactions okay single factor

00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,010
authentication username password is the

00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:16,050
most common type of authentication we

00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,460
have out there and we are a jungle

00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:22,110
conference so let's see how jungle does

00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:23,850
that gem jungle comes by the fall with

00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:26,310
an authentication system the

00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:29,130
configuration required right there we on

00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:33,350
our settings dot py generated by the

00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:36,210
stat project we need three apps of

00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:38,430
content types and sessions in two meters

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,710
session leader and authentication leader

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,500
the content type is used to allow

00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:46,410
permissions to be binded to be

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,330
associated with any model you create in

00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:51,200
there often sessions contain the core of

00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:53,820
the authentication and session framework

00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,100
the main functionality of any

00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:59,970
authentication system is to let the user

00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,230
ring is to verify the user identity so

00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:04,710
that's our entry point the

00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:07,140
authentication function what this

00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:09,570
function does is to iterate over a list

00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,680
of authentication backends tries to

00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:14,190
authenticate the user with the

00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,050
credentials provided and if if any of

00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:19,680
the backends is that this user is denied

00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:22,490
it stops a tempting but if this user is

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,080
authenticated it will return the user

00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,880
this function this function is the core

00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,580
of the authentication system in Django

00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:34,050
but we ended up adding another concept

00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:36,270
here the authentication backends this is

00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:37,800
the API provided by jungle to enable mud

00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:40,740
post source of authentication

00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,419
maybe our company is trying to create a

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,640
single sign-on or you're trying to

00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:49,440
authenticate into another system with

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,840
off to the API is the same you have to

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,040
create an authentication back-end

00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:56,970
defining our front gate and get user

00:08:53,040 --> 00:09:00,140
methods few other stuff register on your

00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:02,310
settings and let Django do the rest by

00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,170
default Django comes with an

00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,689
authentication backing it actually - but

00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:11,220
it just uses

00:09:05,689 --> 00:09:13,769
by default it's the model back in which

00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:17,999
is the implementation of the default

00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:21,870
single factor authentication jungle so

00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:24,059
it gets the username and password gets

00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:26,180
the user and check their password and

00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:29,459
also if the user can authenticate

00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:31,559
there's a hack here a nice one so the

00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:34,379
time of the response of trying to

00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:36,180
authenticate into a existent user was

00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:38,970
different than a non-existent one

00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,740
because the check password hashes the

00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,290
password and takes some times to do that

00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:46,829
so it was easier to attackers to

00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:51,449
discover which users are actually in the

00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:53,370
database so this set password on the

00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:57,120
user model was added to add some

00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:59,309
response time so we just verified our

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,990
user identity using a single factor

00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:03,149
authentication but we need to remember

00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:05,490
that we're over HTTP which is a

00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:08,370
stateless so it doesn't carry

00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,959
information between requests so we need

00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,629
a way to know that the user already

00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:15,689
proved their identity and we don't need

00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:25,559
to ask again on every request this is

00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:27,899
where logging in sessions enter so

00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:29,309
logging is the process to gain access to

00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,559
a system by identifying and

00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:34,500
authenticating where I did that with the

00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:36,930
user so we need a way it is to to know

00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:40,410
that the user already stuff is already

00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:43,139
authenticated and we don't need to twist

00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:45,269
over and over again so the login

00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:49,350
function it takes the authenticated user

00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:51,779
and persists it into the request it also

00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:55,290
uses the session framework to store the

00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:58,769
user primary key and can be accessed on

00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:01,829
every request using the session key so

00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:03,540
after the login is executed the user can

00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:05,519
access the login required resource

00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:10,050
without needing provided to provide

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:13,139
their credentials again log out

00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:15,240
basically induced logging job it flushes

00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:17,250
the user session and change back the

00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,279
user and the request to an anonymous

00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,279
user

00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:28,500
like we can see on the school and like I

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,269
said before HTTP is a stateless which

00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,830
means that the message between client

00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:34,290
and server are completely independent

00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:37,350
from each other and there is no sequence

00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:39,510
or behavior between requests so if you

00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:42,110
want to keep track of your user actions

00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:47,279
you need another way another way to

00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:49,320
manage that session is a temporary in

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,899
the directive information that change

00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:55,500
between two two or more communicating

00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:57,510
devices or a computer in the user it's a

00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,760
mechanism that lets you store a betrayal

00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:01,980
data per browser and have that data

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,649
available whenever the browser connected

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,170
again so we could start out that data in

00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:10,620
cookies or URL parameters in fact they

00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:13,980
are very handy in some cases let's

00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,810
imagine a hotel aggregator service to

00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,519
find a place you need to put the CD you

00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:20,790
want to go check in and check out dates

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:23,910
number of rooms people traveling with

00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:26,490
you and in the future traveling for work

00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:28,140
and then you found the right room and

00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:30,300
you need to share the information with

00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:34,050
someone else or maybe you want to save

00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:35,910
to look at it later a good way to do

00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:38,490
that to have all that information you

00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:42,690
need a URL it's insanely ugly as I know

00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:45,060
but it's very useful that prevents us to

00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:47,940
create an account or log into the system

00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:50,399
just to save the search and also allows

00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:53,040
us to share the URL with someone else

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:59,220
and whoever whoever gets it will see the

00:12:53,040 --> 00:13:01,170
same information but for sensitive data

00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:05,730
the best ways to store on the server

00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:08,070
side so there are many ways to store

00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:11,310
browser data in Django

00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:13,380
it can be a database a file a cache and

00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:16,350
you can even use Django to store in your

00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:18,269
cookies but encrypted but jungles

00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:20,459
default implementation uses database

00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:22,500
actually we have all the implementations

00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:26,550
in jungle but it comes by default

00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:29,220
installed with database so the session

00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:31,920
model has three attributes the session

00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:34,290
key session data and the expired date

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,700
and it lives inside the session lab when

00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:38,760
you'll be great migrate for the first

00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:41,880
time it the table is created but if for

00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:44,220
each time our session was updated hit

00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:49,500
the database it wouldn't be very

00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:53,490
performant perform attic for that jungle

00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:55,769
has a session store object there is an

00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:58,620
interface to access or session data

00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:01,529
without all the model databases overhead

00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:05,699
and it only saves once per request

00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:08,250
request the session store is a subclass

00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:10,560
of the session base and there is a

00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,110
implementation for each session basic

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,029
option Django provides to us and it

00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:18,990
exposed some methods to handle the

00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:21,300
session data create delete load and save

00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:24,630
which actually saves the data in the

00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:27,149
database it's also a dicta like object

00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:32,070
so you can deal with all the data using

00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:34,800
dictionary operations you can use the

00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:37,560
session biased instantiating the session

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,990
store object directly using the session

00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,750
key you already have it if you already

00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:46,230
have it or not passing anything if you

00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:50,220
creating a new one but when you create

00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:53,100
when you cooperate it will create the

00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,440
session key it will create a new session

00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,240
key sorry and story o session data in

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,980
the database so you can access it later

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:04,589
and thanks to the session leader we can

00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:07,290
also use it on on our views already

00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:11,370
instantiated as a request attribute like

00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:13,290
we saw earlier in this talk but and when

00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:16,680
the session mid where is instantiated it

00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:19,380
gets the session store based on what we

00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:22,410
defined on our settings in our case the

00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:25,800
database back-end and its save is it and

00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:28,319
save it as an attribute when the process

00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,120
request is called it tries to get the

00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:32,970
session ID cookie to recover their

00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:35,310
session from the database but if you are

00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:37,110
accessing the site for the first time it

00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:41,310
will be none and the new session store

00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:42,209
will be created it's also thanks to the

00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,180
session widower

00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:45,810
that after we change the session store

00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,990
object

00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:54,090
it gets save it into the database let's

00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:58,500
look at the simplified code so we get if

00:15:54,090 --> 00:16:03,630
our session was modified access or if

00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:06,240
it's empty if it was modified we get the

00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:10,020
session expire date if we set that to

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:13,520
none the session will expire every time

00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:16,740
the browser closes if not we're going to

00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:19,470
it will going to be expired with the

00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:24,900
default value we have on our settings if

00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:27,900
the default is two weeks so but let's

00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:30,480
skim you might that if they did the

00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:33,990
modified flag we want to be true if we

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:37,890
modify the session itself so if we

00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:40,740
modify the session fool here to a bar or

00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:45,120
delete it it will be modified but we if

00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:47,640
we modify a an idle of the session foo

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,570
it won't be modified so the session

00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:54,060
won't be save again save it again

00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:56,070
so after saving the sessions session

00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:58,680
jungle will set the cook and send it to

00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:03,780
the users so we can use again on the

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:06,050
next request so we now understand how

00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:09,360
login works how authentic eight calls

00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:11,459
authentication backends how our phantom

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,500
backends are implemented and we

00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:15,720
understand sessions and how they work

00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:18,510
now we are going to see how those pieces

00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,130
are glued together and to provide the

00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:23,180
authentication feature in Django and

00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:27,449
I'll talk about four different scenarios

00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:29,700
so authenticated user often know an

00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:32,730
authenticated user an authenticated user

00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:36,720
with a session session change user

00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:40,290
authentication and logout so an

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:44,360
authenticated user when or an

00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:47,550
authenticated request arrives in jungles

00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:50,850
project the first mid wire to be used is

00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:53,430
the session leader it tries to get the

00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:55,710
session and since it's your first time

00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:57,690
in the site for a while you don't have

00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,220
the session itself so it creates a new

00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:03,360
session store object

00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:06,570
with a session kid none after that we go

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,220
to authentication widower it checks if

00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:10,320
you already have the session mirror

00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,840
installed because it's required and

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,120
tries to assign a user to the request

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,480
since you're not authenticated it will

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:21,000
be an instance of the anonymous user

00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,910
this get functions function here calls

00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,280
actually calls the authentic e

00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:29,040
authentication back in get user sorry

00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:31,040
this get user function actually call the

00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,690
authentication back in get user function

00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:37,980
that we defined on the beginning of the

00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:40,890
talk so after that we get to our view it

00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:44,930
does its job renders what needs to be

00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:44,930
render and we go back to the mid where

00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:54,840
so the session we do our verifies that

00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:57,300
this if the session store is modified if

00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:00,330
what if it was access it and if it's

00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:03,150
empty since we didn't change anything on

00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:05,340
our session nothing will happen here the

00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:10,560
cookie won't be set and we don't have a

00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:14,750
session actually ok so next case is an

00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:17,640
authenticated user with a session change

00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:21,390
so until we get to the view it's

00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:23,820
basically the same the session mid word

00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,890
tries to get the session it can't so it

00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,600
creates a new one

00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:30,450
the off mid where binds the anonymous

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,580
user with the request and then we get to

00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:35,490
the view and in the view here I'll

00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:36,330
change like a bit of the session just to

00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:40,290
see what happens

00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:42,780
Oh add my name here Ranade and the view

00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:45,090
wrap things up returns what need to be

00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:50,580
rendered and we get back to the session

00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:53,160
middle so since we added something on

00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:56,640
our session it is modified it is access

00:19:53,160 --> 00:20:00,540
it and is not empty so we will calculate

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,880
the session expiry date we'll save the

00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:04,920
session and we will set the cookie in

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,420
the response to be attach it to the

00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:11,129
browser as we can see here on our

00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:15,999
developer tools of choice

00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:18,789
and now we have a session attach it to

00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:22,110
an anonymous user let's see what happens

00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:25,809
when that user logs into the system so

00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:28,870
again we go over the session leader but

00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:30,970
now we have a session ID cookie we get

00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:36,279
that and create a new instance of the

00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:38,350
session store with that key we follow to

00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:41,309
the authentication widower and it will

00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:47,409
bind a non Mose user with the request

00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:49,210
and we get our login view login view is

00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:53,200
a form view and like we saw on

00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:56,259
Philippe's talk it will call the is

00:20:53,200 --> 00:21:00,879
valid function on the authentication

00:20:56,259 --> 00:21:03,519
form that is valid function actually

00:21:00,879 --> 00:21:05,830
calls the errors property which calls

00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:08,440
the full clean method which will call

00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:11,139
the clean method and that's where the

00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,450
magic happens we get the username and

00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:16,470
password and we call the authenticate

00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:18,700
function like we saw earlier the

00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:21,039
authenticate function we will terr it

00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,200
over the authentication back ends we

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,749
only have one so it will check the

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,700
password and with it we'll return the

00:21:25,749 --> 00:21:31,570
user the authenticated user to the

00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:34,659
authenticated function which we returned

00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:37,840
the user to the authentication form with

00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:39,999
the backend as an attribute and the

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,860
authentication for will be valid because

00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:47,710
we don't raise any errors errors here

00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:50,409
the post receives true from the form is

00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:52,809
valid so it will call the form valid

00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:59,049
function which you perform the login

00:21:52,809 --> 00:22:02,590
itself so we it will verify that the

00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:05,519
user the authenticated sorry it will

00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:09,009
verify if the user has the authenticated

00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:11,440
authenticated session key it's hard it

00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:13,450
doesn't so it wasn't as encoded before

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,139
us so it will cycle the click the key

00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:20,289
this process actually gets the previous

00:22:17,139 --> 00:22:23,139
data we had on our session creates a new

00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:24,630
key and keep that data again

00:22:23,139 --> 00:22:26,520
so when

00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:30,480
logging and we have something on our

00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:32,880
sessions it will be maintained we start

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,010
the session P and the back end in the

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,200
session and we attach the user to the

00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:42,950
request and now we can go back to the

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:45,710
session middle so in the session middle

00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:49,380
our request was accessed

00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:51,990
modified and is not empty so we'll set

00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:54,390
the expire date and your saver session

00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:57,710
so the user can access through every

00:22:54,390 --> 00:23:04,280
request and we set the session ID cookie

00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:07,560
and then we are logging in now to logout

00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:10,110
so again the request arrives in the

00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:15,530
session leader it gets the user session

00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:17,850
key and its initiate a new session store

00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:21,480
the request then follows to the

00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:24,300
authentication mirror and so it gets the

00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:27,060
user and this function calls this get

00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:31,250
user function here it will get the user

00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:34,350
ID from the session so we start the user

00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:37,710
private primary key in the session key

00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:43,170
value of our session it will retrieve

00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:48,870
that it will get the backend from the

00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:52,890
session actually also and for each of

00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:56,220
the authentication backends it will load

00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:59,760
the backend and try to get the user if

00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:02,400
we sorry not for each for the backend we

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:05,520
had define it it will load the back end

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:10,410
and get the user and it will return the

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:13,350
user to our previous out mid or get user

00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:16,770
function so we get to our logout view

00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:20,310
with our user in the request it will

00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:23,790
call the logout function which will

00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:26,790
flush the session and replace the user

00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:30,900
back to in the request with the

00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:34,590
anonymous user and then we follow again

00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:36,120
to the session mid where the session is

00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:38,250
now empty because we flush it it

00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:41,100
actually flushes

00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:43,020
a clean and the delete so it raised the

00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,630
data from the session and deletes the

00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:47,880
key so the session is now empty

00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:50,850
and since you is still have the session

00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:53,700
ID cookie on our cookies it can be

00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:56,480
deleted and we are final lock it out

00:24:53,700 --> 00:25:01,110
thank you Thanks

00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:14,420
[Applause]
