[Music]

00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:20,029
uh let's put our hands together one more

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:25,670
time for Foucault Joe for Jessica for

00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:29,570
Django con for waking up early sorry for

00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:32,330
anyone's names I forgot I'm going to

00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:35,600
talk about building but not not building

00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:38,809
code like we normally do right and not

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,050
building our skills but building

00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:44,300
community and in that effort supporting

00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,800
each other the people to your left and

00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,080
right and behind you and if you're the

00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,320
front row I'm gonna win in front of you

00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,680
all right

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,210
I'm Matt Mitchell I have like a BIOS

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,680
live I had such a really nice bio I

00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,739
don't need this bio slide it's just like

00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,210
throw that out all right

00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:01,549
I'm a hacker and a security researcher

00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,979
and when I interface with Python and

00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:05,869
Django it's from application security it

00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:06,890
lends normally but I'm not talking about

00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:09,470
that today which I'm really excited

00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,600
about and also today I'd like to

00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:14,330
announce my retirement from giving talks

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,700
so this is probably gonna be the last

00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:19,009
normal Matt Mitchell talk that I ever

00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,259
give we'll see what happens if I'll like

00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:23,119
fake retirement to come back but do a

00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:27,109
Michael Jordan but I think this might be

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:29,780
the last one when I was reached by the

00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:31,520
Django con organizers to speak and they

00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,380
talked about how they saw another one of

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,969
my talks I started looking into this

00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,799
conference and I was like who are these

00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:40,579
people in San Diego why do they want me

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,619
to talk you know I work with a group

00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:45,109
called tactical tech or the tactical

00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:46,700
technology collective it's an NGO or

00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:49,130
non-governmental organization based in

00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,439
Berlin Germany and we teach people about

00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,789
the dark side of technology but also how

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,319
to protect themselves from it and

00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:56,689
educate themselves and are really not

00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:59,289
doom and gloom so it's like black mirror

00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:02,240
with a smiley face at the end you know

00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:05,539
cool that landed all right thank you

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,929
caffeine all right so when I looked into

00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:11,750
Jango Khan I was amazed because I found

00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:14,060
out that this conference has everything

00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:17,090
that all the major conferences tell you

00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:19,489
it's too hard to do and this conference

00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:21,530
is community run this conference is

00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:22,819
volunteer run and every year when you

00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,530
think they did everything that you could

00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:27,290
possibly think of to be welcoming

00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:29,000
and inclusive and exciting then they

00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,160
just like dunk on you and you start one

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,040
other thing on there and if you go to a

00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,840
larger conference one that's like got

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,730
thousands if not tens of thousands of

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,610
nerds and developers and geeks attending

00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:42,920
please point them to this conference of

00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,360
a conference that's doing it right the

00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,890
hater and me was like they gotta be

00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,880
doing something wrong but I just found

00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:53,180
more and more gold okay okay

00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:56,090
yeah only an untitled goose or duck

00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,910
actually it can like ruin this mice

00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,560
which people out there okay so um I just

00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:03,680
want you to put your hands together one

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,050
more time for these people who are the

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,280
recipients of the diversity sponsors the

00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,320
are people who got the opportunity

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,170
grants the people who are parents and

00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,060
and took advantage of the child care

00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,590
grants people who you know are reading

00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,380
this caption right here because they

00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:20,600
make us stronger and if a conference is

00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,700
a civilization it's weird when we don't

00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,980
see it elders and it's very strange we

00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,810
don't see children and we should see

00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,360
representations of the entire world and

00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:38,840
I see that here at Jango Khan so thank

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:40,250
you for being here okay it's early so I

00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,570
promise that's like the last of the

00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:46,850
clapping Jango Khan advertises itself as

00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:48,470
a conference with heart and you know

00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:50,510
they have a code of conduct but I'm the

00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:52,040
person to read the code of conduct and I

00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,709
really loved the first thing which was

00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,709
like be kind to others and that really

00:03:54,709 --> 00:04:04,400
has a lot to do with building community

00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:07,459
right what is community and how do we

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,799
build it you know we might know how we

00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:11,720
might tackle that next project that a

00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:14,150
project manager gives us or that a

00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,620
client gives us or if we're working on

00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,239
open source project with people around

00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,359
the world with some problem that they're

00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:22,250
tackling but community you know there's

00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:24,740
no like hello world model for for

00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:28,190
community you know I like to think of

00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,780
community as this for whatever reason

00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:33,110
you love

00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,190
Jenko right and normally when you're in

00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,720
the outside world

00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,270
maybe you're ostracized for that love

00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,710
and you know maybe maybe people who I am

00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,480
I'm into Python but I never really got

00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:44,800
into Django or whatever the case is but

00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:47,750
here it's Django all the time 24/7 right

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,970
but the community here is larger than

00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:54,470
that we're not just here as individuals

00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:56,930
who love a language or a framework so

00:04:54,470 --> 00:05:00,190
I'm gonna not ask you to clap but you

00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:02,510
know raise your hand if you're a parent

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,250
all right if you look to your left and

00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,620
right keep your hands up keep them up

00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,960
keep up you'll see other parents

00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,460
that's your community as well nobody

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,620
knows why you've got that baby food

00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,120
stain on you or why that teenager is

00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,200
like texting you all the time like those

00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,070
people who have their hands up you can

00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,900
um I promise okay

00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:23,390
raise your hand if you love video games

00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,850
I love video games I'm a switch maniac

00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:28,460
that's my community nerds out there

00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:30,230
right who are traveling and wrestling

00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,030
with our hotel TVs to get the HDMI to

00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:35,060
display their favorite console right you

00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:37,400
can lower your hands and a lot of time

00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,650
the community that brings us together is

00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,810
invisible it's an invisible community

00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,670
and it's hard to see that outside

00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:45,380
community when we attend conferences

00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,900
that's what I liked what Kojo said about

00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:50,900
the pac-man shape I want you to explore

00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,940
these days and find not only your your

00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,410
django community or maybe the community

00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,690
people who work with you and the same

00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:59,180
thing but try to find that invisible

00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:02,180
community right and try to and try to

00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:04,190
build on that right and it's really

00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,660
difficult to build a community I have

00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,920
this blueprint here of like an engine

00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,700
which is like a mystery to me have no

00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:12,290
idea what's going on and one thing that

00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,330
helps us when it comes to building

00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:17,060
community is realizing that we are not

00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,470
alone not to sound like Michael Jackson

00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:24,530
although I have the Janet Jackson

00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:26,030
earpiece so and when it comes to

00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:28,430
building community I like to point

00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,570
towards some folks in tech who are doing

00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,700
amazing things when it comes to build

00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:35,630
the community and what are they getting

00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:39,260
right right but let me talk about

00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:42,650
something else okay talk about how we

00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:44,300
can support people around us supporting

00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,500
people around us means understanding

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,170
that everyone has something to

00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:51,290
contribute and everyone has a strengths

00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:52,250
right and when you're finding you're

00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:55,280
hitting community

00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:57,410
also look for your hidden weakness and

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,640
others hidden strengths no matter who

00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,470
you are in this room you've got

00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,870
something to contribute not just to

00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,940
Django as an open-source community but

00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:09,710
also to the this community here in San

00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:11,360
Diego and throughout the world I travel

00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,490
around the world because of my work in

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,290
security I specialize in working with

00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,900
marginalized groups everywhere in the

00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:20,600
world and just two weeks ago I was in

00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,250
Agra India I had like two days vacation

00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,890
after like an assignment and I was like

00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:27,650
hey let me check out the Taj Mahal and I

00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:29,390
was blown away by its beauty and I was

00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,340
thinking like how do you build something

00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,810
like this even like if you could go to

00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:36,130
Home Depot tomorrow and try to build it

00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:41,210
let alone when this thing was built and

00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:44,900
what it took work several fingers and

00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:47,360
hands working in unison I heard a story

00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,610
that the beauty of the Taj Mahal was

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,460
meant to be never replicated so the

00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:55,220
artisans who carved into all these rocks

00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:58,330
and stones and gems had their thumbs cut

00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,440
off so they can never do that again and

00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:04,700
thankfully we're not gonna do that to

00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:07,880
you today right but also while I was in

00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:10,220
Agra after leaving the Taj Mahal there's

00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,330
a community around it obviously because

00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:16,520
a lot of tourists come from around the

00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:18,740
world there much like github and there

00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,140
is this place called she rose she rose

00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:23,120
hangout it was called and I was like oh

00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,530
she rose hangout that sounds cool all

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,419
right and the comic book nerd in me was

00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:29,120
excited for a minute and then I read

00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:34,450
more about she rose and she rose has a

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:36,830
tragic past there are women in India

00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:40,490
especially in rural areas or in areas

00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:44,240
where there's a lot of misogyny sexism

00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:47,210
and they are attacked by their community

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,280
but with acid right and there's now like

00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:51,470
a ban on acid so you shouldn't be able

00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:54,140
to buy acid that you could use to clear

00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:57,470
a drain or something but a lot of women

00:08:54,140 --> 00:09:02,290
were victims of acid attacks and she

00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:05,840
Rose is a community of survivors and

00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:10,300
when you go to Shiro's there's

00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:12,710
graphs everywhere of women's faces and

00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,000
one thing that you're struck by because

00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,440
everyone who works there is a survivor

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,570
whether they work in the kitchen or they

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,560
you're the waiter or there are the

00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:22,190
people who like running the video

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,570
projector is how much resilience they

00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,540
have and how much strength they have

00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:28,820
because they have community and they

00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,370
look at each other and they see inner

00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:35,480
beauty and that's why these photos on

00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:38,450
the wall are photos of strength and they

00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:41,210
see faces like theirs and they are like

00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:43,070
these are the proudest strongest faces

00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:47,930
and they raise their chins in their

00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:51,770
faces hi and there's signs all around

00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:56,360
the cafe that say things like you can do

00:09:51,770 --> 00:10:00,200
it don't give up every day a miracle is

00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:02,540
possible and it's not just words it's

00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,450
something that you see like in the

00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:08,360
energy of the room around you from the

00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:11,690
strength of these women they have built

00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,160
a community and in these four walls they

00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,670
are the most beautiful people on the

00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,400
planet

00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:18,530
and they resonate that when they step

00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,990
out of it and it's something that really

00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:23,150
shook me to my core and I thought wow I

00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:28,970
have to talk about this when I go to

00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:31,130
Jango Khan right so I took this slide

00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:35,150
from a Jango book because some people

00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:38,300
are like what's up dude Jango right and

00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:40,520
I thought how can I figure out what is

00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,740
this power where does it come from right

00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,730
where does the strength and how do you

00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,280
build community

00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:48,170
where do you tap into that you know the

00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,420
nerd in me I want to see the source code

00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:53,270
the nerd in me wants to learn this

00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:55,640
framework how do I do that and I thought

00:10:53,270 --> 00:11:00,350
maybe it's like MTV all right maybe it's

00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:02,740
like that model template view speak a

00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:05,510
language you understand here okay

00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,160
all right so I was thinking please

00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:11,920
excuse the ugliness on my slide I am NOT

00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:15,980
an artist the model in this seems to be

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:19,399
some kind of data all right who you are

00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:21,980
and where you are maybe you're someone

00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:24,829
who self identifies as a woman and maybe

00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:28,070
you're in India in Agra or maybe you're

00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:29,870
in a village in the outskirts right but

00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,550
then there's something about you that's

00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,110
different from other people there's a

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,850
drive inside of you

00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:37,070
there's these norms it's code of conduct

00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:42,100
that you've built within yourself and

00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:45,050
that's like your template right and then

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,399
there's this outlook on this world where

00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,769
we all experience everything together

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,310
but in this world you bring it all

00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:51,920
together

00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:59,570
and that's how you have real community

00:11:51,920 --> 00:12:02,060
right I'm gonna talk about examples of

00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:04,610
other people in tech who shine with that

00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,260
same energy who puzzle me by how they

00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,449
can dig so deep and find this inner

00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:10,399
strength and I hope that you know on

00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:12,050
these next few days as you challenge

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,480
yourself in these conference rooms and

00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,589
you did you know deliberate with

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,029
yourself whether you're gonna sign up

00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:20,149
for a lightning talk the answer is yes

00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:23,180
you will right you dig deep and you find

00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:25,850
that inner strength in yourself okay the

00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,860
knowledge house is in the Bronx New York

00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:29,389
which is not from Manhattan and it's

00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,329
even further up than Harlem where I do

00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:33,920
my crypto Harlem Project right and the

00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:36,980
knowledge house is completely committed

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,920
to sharing the excitement of technology

00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:42,019
with people who cannot maybe even afford

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,389
their laptop or maybe are dealing with a

00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:47,000
lot of issues in their community it's a

00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:49,310
an area that is bright and strong and

00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,889
powerful but also one that's dealing

00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:54,380
with economic disadvantages issues with

00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:55,910
crime etc but it's also got a vibrant

00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,829
community that so far has been like

00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:00,260
resilient and strong fighting against

00:12:57,829 --> 00:13:02,480
gentrification and in the center of the

00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:04,730
Bronx there's a warehouse that it's just

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,910
a brick wall unlike almost a dead-end

00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:10,339
street not far from a major highway but

00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:12,860
when you go inside it's like every nerds

00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:15,649
favorite place it's got consoles and the

00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,180
sofa it's got giant screens and there

00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:19,459
people they're learning Python and

00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,529
learning Django who have come from

00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:24,920
completely untraditional backgrounds I

00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:27,499
met someone who worked at as a chef at

00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,449
Trader Joe's or whole and Whole Foods

00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:31,459
and things like that and he was like you

00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:34,129
know what I'm picking up a check right

00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:36,769
now but uh and I'm a big fan of the NBA

00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:38,779
but I just want more I'm really into my

00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:40,999
mobile phone I got a Samsung phone and I

00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:42,740
want to learn not just how to consume

00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:45,499
apps on this thing but how to make some

00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,029
I want to learn what goes on when it

00:13:45,499 --> 00:13:49,100
comes to data and he went to the

00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:50,689
knowledge house and he became a data

00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,059
scientist and he was like building app

00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:54,679
said like would predict who would win

00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:57,319
what game based on all this data and it

00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:59,389
was amazing to watch this happen it was

00:13:57,319 --> 00:14:01,129
just a normal person from our community

00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:03,230
not someone who maybe has gone through

00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:06,199
the paths that you might hear about but

00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:08,059
who you know a kind of bootcamp type

00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:11,720
program came out of someone who loves

00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:13,160
data science there was someone at the

00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,220
knowledge house okay hold on me and make

00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:19,429
sure I get this right well named Asher

00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:22,160
and they built this thing called Pi

00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:24,980
ghosts and they had never coded anything

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,019
before knowledge house is focused on

00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,179
people who when they see the hello world

00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:30,230
shining back at them that sense of

00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:31,490
accomplishment I don't if you could ever

00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:34,220
remember that day if you go that far

00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:35,540
back in your memory right they share

00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,769
that with the people around them and

00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,569
then we they find the things that they

00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:42,259
love and inspire them to push forward

00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:45,139
with it and Asher loved hip-hop Asher

00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:46,639
was like I love hip-hop and I love

00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:48,499
trying to find out what my favorite

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,089
rapper is saying but I'm concerned

00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:52,459
sometimes with the amount of profanity

00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:54,889
so they built a tool to help them and it

00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:57,019
will read the apps so I read the lyrics

00:14:54,889 --> 00:15:00,499
of their favorite song and it'll make a

00:14:57,019 --> 00:15:02,629
clean version of it so Asher knows what

00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:04,040
slangs mean and knows which ones are a

00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:05,809
little bit too much on this side verse

00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,629
that and just like you know this is an

00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:10,129
appropriate recoding of that and you

00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:12,769
know had something that did the basic

00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:14,209
not natural language processing and made

00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:15,939
a clean version of the entire hip-hop

00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:19,100
universe it was pretty amazing

00:15:15,939 --> 00:15:22,309
all with like really early and

00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:25,100
rudimentary Python skills but just had a

00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:28,540
mission and made it happen and it really

00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,540
was exciting to me

00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:32,610
the people who take classes at the

00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,410
knowledge house are able to take those

00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:37,370
classes because this boot camp is

00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:39,839
heavily subsidized by volunteers donors

00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:41,940
and the city of New York itself if

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,899
you're on unemployment insurance you can

00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,670
say you know what

00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:47,040
instead of getting trained on how to

00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:50,100
type or use Microsoft Office can I learn

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,199
tango or a Python and a lot of times

00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,060
your municipality will be like you know

00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:55,470
II think so should be fine you know and

00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:59,010
that's how knowledge house was able to

00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:00,720
do this they have diverse trainers

00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:03,630
people who come from all walks of life

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,639
some people are in Manhattan working on

00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,680
their kind of Silicon Alley jobs and

00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:09,389
then they took a train uptown and they

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,320
help out at the knowledge house other

00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:12,089
people with people who live in the

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,260
community but the cool thing is that the

00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:15,630
knowledge house is based in the

00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:18,089
community so people who are parents or

00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:19,860
people who have like you know our job

00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:22,260
schedules are able to still take their

00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,240
classes and while some students aren't

00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,920
able to attend every class that's

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,870
quickly forgiven because people

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,660
understand the needs of the community

00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:36,089
and one thing I really loved about it is

00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:39,420
the attendees are given training on how

00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:40,800
to pass a job interview one of my

00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,779
favorite things when I'm sitting there

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,640
at the knowledge house I get to watch

00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:46,589
they're kind of like final project

00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,690
presentations which each one of those I

00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:51,870
tell you if you get a chance to watch it

00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:54,449
just like really inspire you is I asked

00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:57,209
them who here has ever stood up in a

00:16:54,449 --> 00:17:00,120
stand up before and they're like oh no

00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:01,920
hands go up right uh who here's worked

00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,310
on a sprinter knows about agile really

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,100
well

00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:07,230
oh no don't really know that right and

00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,299
then I'm like well okay well like how

00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:11,100
would you approach this particular thing

00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:11,970
and they're like well I've used to

00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,280
working on these problems with myself

00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:15,839
and just like just I just like dig deep

00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,400
but I just keep trying by myself in a

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,059
corner and these are all things that

00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,870
will ruin you in a job interview but are

00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:24,480
normal for someone who's going through a

00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:26,610
bootcamp experience and until you give

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,940
them a really simulation of that

00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:32,460
interview interrogation you can't expect

00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,590
them to get that job right and knowledge

00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,630
I've spent a lot of time on that there's

00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,400
been a lot of time saying look this is

00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,320
what a resume looks like when you're

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,540
trying to get a job at Trader Joe's or

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,160
at Home Depot or something and that

00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:46,650
well your resume looks like but this is

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,390
a tech resume and it looks different and

00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:51,000
yours will stand out in a way that'll

00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:53,070
Destin it for the shredder right and we

00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,570
have to make sure that you get in front

00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,700
of that person because once they score

00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:58,770
the interview and people get to see them

00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,380
and see their projects and look at their

00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:03,090
code then everything is understood but

00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,980
it's so hard to just get in that place

00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:07,200
and knowledge house spends just as much

00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,360
time teaching code is teaching how to

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,520
get that first job you know and that's

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:18,990
what I really was a really happy with an

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:21,690
inspired by go through ok so one of the

00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:22,890
many things I do is I'm on the Advisory

00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:26,970
Council for a group called the open

00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:30,060
Technology Fund or OTF and the open

00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:31,740
Technology fund is an amazing entity in

00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:34,920
tech that most people have never heard

00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:38,250
of they will fund any open source

00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:40,620
project to you know three hundred

00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:44,070
thousand dollars a year a year over year

00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:46,470
etc right if you have an idea they even

00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:49,740
have a new project that'll fund just an

00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:52,200
idea they'll give you twelve weeks and

00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:55,560
six thousand dollars just make your idea

00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:58,110
real and if you're a UX designer or

00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,430
you're a product person you don't even

00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:02,340
need to make that idea they have their

00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:06,660
own implementers who can make the idea

00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:08,430
for you right a lot of open source tools

00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,980
and projects that people use especially

00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:13,260
in security like mail Volokh or tor

00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,270
browser or even signal the encrypted

00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,040
messaging app receive their first

00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:20,340
funding and continue to receive funding

00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:22,560
from OTF and as an advisory council

00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,510
member I'm tasked with looking at these

00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,660
amazing proposals from all around the

00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:29,970
world all open source and deciding who's

00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:32,040
allowed to get a small amount of seed

00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:35,690
funding to maybe turn this into a full

00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,690
time gig for them and their contributors

00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:42,510
but one thing that I never really looked

00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:46,440
at twice was the OTF website so smooth

00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:48,960
so slick right who built it and how did

00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,550
they build it and one day I was at one

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,740
of the International OTF meetings the

00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,210
summit's and there they were taking

00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,320
feedback from people just please write

00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,100
down how we can make this thing better

00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:02,670
on a card

00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:07,620
and it was torch box okay boom

00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:11,700
so I talked to Tom of torch box coal so

00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:13,260
works on wagtail which is a CMS that's

00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,930
even better than WordPress no offense

00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,740
automatic right running on Django strong

00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:20,760
okay

00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:23,160
right and I was like you know this is

00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,050
amazing how did you build this thing we

00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,540
is on the back end there's so many

00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:30,900
complicated parts to it it's so slippery

00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:34,260
buttery smooth and what is torch box

00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:37,800
what is your magic what is that MTV that

00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:39,930
makes you work and when dissecting this

00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,370
whole thing and Tom's here so if you

00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:43,440
didn't go to tutorial yesterday no shame

00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,520
you could find him maybe you could do a

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:50,670
lightning talk on what you learned about

00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:53,700
wagtail and I was looking at the torch

00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:57,360
box or more and I found that this crazy

00:20:53,700 --> 00:21:00,360
headline torch box transfers not 1% not

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:03,000
2% 100% of their business to employee

00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:05,100
ownership trust and that was just this

00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,410
summer that means that the people who

00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,880
work at torch box who are seventy lucky

00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:13,260
individuals right now which is crazy

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:16,890
it's an insane amount right are the

00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,940
owners of the company themselves now I

00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:20,250
don't know if you've looked at your

00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,390
employee agreement that you signed but

00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,980
you don't even own the source code you

00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:25,770
dream up when you're not in the building

00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,520
let alone own that company right but a

00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:28,920
torch box

00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,870
it's all yours because the thing you

00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:34,110
have in common with people who work in

00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:36,450
companies out there is with the people

00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:38,220
who you work with it's just you all

00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:39,810
passed the same job interview and you go

00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,640
to the same office and you work on this

00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:43,380
code and that's all you really started

00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,030
in common with right you all got the

00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,620
same job you enter the same call in it

00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:48,480
you're at the same building together and

00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,100
you're gonna see these people like it or

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,470
not more than you'll see your friends

00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:55,500
your families your enemies your video

00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:57,900
game console any of that stuff right but

00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,220
a torch box you're doing it not just for

00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,750
the paycheck and not just for the love

00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,250
of a challenge and not just for the

00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,810
feeling of accomplishment when you

00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:06,420
finish a project but you're doing it

00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:09,750
because this is your company too and the

00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:12,419
decisions made a torch box are not

00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:14,220
you know like those I come from an

00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:15,929
activist background and I remember those

00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,549
flat organizations I was in where

00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:18,990
everything was decided by committee like

00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:21,029
who washes the dishes at this anarchist

00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:22,980
punk squad and it's like oh no you know

00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:24,539
and like nothing got done we spent one

00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,460
percent of the time like making change

00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:27,720
happen and 99% of the time kind of

00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,950
figure out like you know who was

00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,159
throwing cigarette butts outside of the

00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:34,500
house you know so but torch box still is

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,419
run like a real legit company and

00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,389
they're a model of how you can do it and

00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:41,789
it's not easy but I wish them the the

00:22:39,389 --> 00:22:43,500
biggest of success we live in a time

00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:46,710
when things like tech worker collective

00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:49,139
is real and companies that inspired me

00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:53,450
for their dedication to one thing or

00:22:49,139 --> 00:22:57,299
another have later disappointed me right

00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:59,570
like I look at be corpse right whichever

00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:02,639
like we have a public benefit we have a

00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:06,659
outside agenda that's to support people

00:23:02,639 --> 00:23:08,519
companies like Kickstarter right who are

00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:11,850
now challenged with the issues of

00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:13,200
employees trying to organize right which

00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,509
is like a new thing we see like google

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,950
walk out every day but in torch box

00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:20,210
you're walking out of your own home

00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:22,830
that's that to you it's employee-owned

00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:24,779
so I asked him about this some more and

00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:26,690
here's some points that he'd brought up

00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:29,220
all right

00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:30,600
he said that we set out to do digital

00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,350
work for people making the world a

00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,019
better place

00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:36,509
and I thought wow that's a really

00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:39,750
inspirational goal what's the user story

00:23:36,509 --> 00:23:40,919
for that one right so as a user I can

00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:46,379
make this world better

00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:48,330
right and that 90% of their work is for

00:23:46,379 --> 00:23:51,389
nonprofits and that's a model that

00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:52,950
they've not like purposely stuck to you

00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:55,259
but that's the work that really inspires

00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:57,059
the people who work there they're like

00:23:55,259 --> 00:23:59,070
look I'm working on a project for a

00:23:57,059 --> 00:24:02,039
company that you know is a non-profit

00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:05,659
and it has an agenda and a reason for

00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:08,730
existing that's greater than itself and

00:24:05,659 --> 00:24:11,250
he talked about releasing wagtail in

00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:13,940
2014 and their commitment to wagtail

00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:15,870
which is not necessarily a profitable

00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,580
commitment but it's a commitment to

00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:20,929
proving that this thing can happen there

00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:23,850
can be a CMS like it and because of that

00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:26,309
it's attracted a lot of new developer

00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:30,270
we were so excited by it it's attracted

00:24:26,309 --> 00:24:32,460
groups like the open tech fund and p.m.

00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:34,679
PR stations which also use wagtail to

00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:37,260
support their stuff and even the

00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:39,120
National Health Services of the UK or

00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:42,410
Wow we're looking at the wagtail and

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:45,620
it's cool that you can kind of have this

00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:47,880
maybe if you are working on a

00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:50,520
traditional project in a larger company

00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:53,429
maybe you can open source a kind of

00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,500
skunk work project and use that as a way

00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:58,260
to for retention and keep people excited

00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,120
and use that as a way to attract new

00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,860
talent and have like people who are

00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:07,950
writing job post and hiring managers

00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:13,799
promoting that project I can't let's go

00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:16,679
back to cool I reached out to another

00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:18,299
person who seems to be able to build

00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:20,309
community who seems to be able to

00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:22,650
support people around them and I was

00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:23,220
like what is like your magic how do you

00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:29,730
do this

00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:34,490
what's your mtv rant and this is Laura

00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:39,330
teach and Laura's from Nairobi Kenya and

00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:41,940
love security lives in Africa and I just

00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:45,210
talked to Laura - I'll talk to Tom quite

00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:47,400
recently and Laura has a project called

00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,500
she hacks which is a conference that

00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:52,039
growing and a project that's like huge

00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:55,530
and bigger than than just Nairobi and

00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:57,929
she hacks is focused on getting anyone

00:25:55,530 --> 00:26:01,020
into security especially women into

00:25:57,929 --> 00:26:03,140
security just like anywhere

00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,940
cybersecurity is a huge field and

00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:07,679
cybersecurity has more jobs than people

00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,179
I know that my partner Rose tells me

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,919
like stop with the cybersecurity

00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:15,179
evangelism but I can't stop it

00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:17,610
and with cybersecurity being a huge

00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:20,190
thing there are more and more women in

00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:22,679
Africa who are excited about it and go

00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:25,049
from learning JavaScript and Python and

00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:27,230
Django into the security but what they

00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:33,150
found is not a lot of support for them

00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:34,000
and Laura decided to change that she

00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:37,230
hacks

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,420
is focused on community focused on

00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:42,340
getting people excited about not just

00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:44,170
this journey they're on and not just

00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,270
these challenges but doing it together

00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:49,360
with a person to the left and right and

00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:51,580
something that really inspires me and I

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,620
asked her I was like hey tell me some

00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:56,110
more about like the magic behind she

00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:59,500
hacks which hopefully is right here and

00:26:56,110 --> 00:27:01,540
she said yes they use Python for

00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:04,150
security scripting and they're really

00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:05,380
excited about Django right now as a way

00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:07,570
to kind of create a lens on these

00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:10,330
scripts and create like web accessible

00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:12,010
tools right and when I asked her like

00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:13,720
what are something that you can if you

00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:15,670
could speak to these amazing people in

00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,350
San Diego if I could fly you here and

00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:20,680
teleport you if I bring you into this

00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:22,150
room she said I would tell them to find

00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,160
something that you're passionate about

00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:25,720
find something that's missing from your

00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:29,410
community whatever community you

00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:31,840
self-identify in because when you focus

00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:34,000
on that it'll inspire you it'll inspire

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,410
you to get up on a rainy day it'll

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,470
inspire you to get up when you have a

00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:42,250
cold and we all have those other

00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:43,990
communities were part of she wanted me

00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:46,180
to tell you to stay focused no matter

00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,750
what she's like I know it's hard out

00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,400
there

00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,350
you're developers like we're developers

00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,610
and not every day is easy and there's a

00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:55,680
lot of distractions things that come up

00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:55,680
but stay focused on why you started this

00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:00,670
she said when you stay focused on it

00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,620
that passion will become like your

00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:04,030
mission statement and it'll solve the

00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:06,160
problems for you it'll get you through

00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:08,530
it please hang on she told me to tell

00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:11,560
you guys she said whatever dream you

00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:14,830
have whatever it made you do this in the

00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:16,450
first place don't forget that don't

00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:18,760
forget your first excitement when you

00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:20,770
were able to like you know run a build

00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:23,680
and it was it passed all your tests the

00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:25,030
first run right or when you're even be

00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,830
able to just create like a very simple

00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:28,810
interface that worked with an API you

00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,670
were challenged by hold on to those

00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:32,100
small accomplishments because that's who

00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:35,620
you are

00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:38,110
she said the more people I help the more

00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:40,090
people want to help me and that's

00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:42,340
something that she wanted you to do she

00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:43,840
said if you help another person hey you

00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,910
don't understand how this works I was

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,470
challenged by that oh I noticed that you

00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:49,000
have this bug on your

00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:50,230
beep oh you know what I got two hours

00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,080
I'm just gonna tackle that from home

00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:55,080
right it's gonna give back to you

00:28:55,289 --> 00:29:00,490
she says she started her group on

00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:03,669
whatsapp with some women in 2016 on

00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:05,470
August 4th because they were asking

00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:08,140
questions in different security forums

00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:09,159
in Nairobi and people were like boo get

00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,559
out of here newb you don't know what

00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:13,630
you're doing right and that lack of

00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:15,549
support they were like wow we feel

00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:17,289
really ostracized and down but we don't

00:29:15,549 --> 00:29:18,250
want to give up and so whatsapp group

00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:20,980
started with just like two or three

00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:22,270
people right it was just Lauren some

00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,740
friends and then they're like oh I know

00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:25,210
someone who also wants to do this stuff

00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,950
oh I know someone who also didn't feel

00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:28,780
comfortable and that group that's so big

00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:31,809
of just on unwieldly whatsapp group and

00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:33,669
that's how she hack started now it's it

00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:36,640
went from 30 women who are youth doing

00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:38,799
the she hacks thing every day to 270 and

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:43,929
they're in 12 universities throughout

00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:49,480

talking really fast I think I'm gonna

00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:02,710
finish early so what is community gram

00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:04,150
community is someone who loses things

00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,520

together that make us closer than family

00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:20,590
community is trying to solve something

00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,880
for three hours and then reading

00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,289

but I could talk all day about this

00:30:54,700 --> 00:31:02,679
stuff it's important why we build code

00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:03,220
if I said why do you build code what

00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:05,919
would you answer

00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:11,710
can I put you on the spot Kojo why do

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:16,450
you build code to solve problems who

00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:18,479
builds code to solve problems that's a

00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:24,489
huge community code yeah congratulations

00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:26,859

millions of people once you decided hey

00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,909
you know what I'm working on my code

00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:38,619
today and this is one of the rare

00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:40,359
