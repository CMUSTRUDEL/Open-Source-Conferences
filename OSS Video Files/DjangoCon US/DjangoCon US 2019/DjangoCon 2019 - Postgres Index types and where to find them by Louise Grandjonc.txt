Description: 
	DjangoCon 2019 - Postgres Index types and where to find them by Louise Grandjonc

For a long time I only used the default btree to index data. As I was working on an app for crocodiles to find their dentist, I started looking into the other index types postgres offers to improve SQL performance. If you want to know all about btree, gin, gist… how, when and why use them, join me!

00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:21,770
hello oh yes it works okay um so hi

00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,390
I'm really happy to be here at dango con

00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,580
it's really exciting it's my first

00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:29,300
django con I was in Django con Europe a

00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:31,220
couple years ago so I'm going to today

00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,160
talk about Paz breasts index types and

00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:37,040
even if my title contains something

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,320
referring to a very bad movie I'm mostly

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,470
going to be talking about crocodiles and

00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,870
not Harry Potter references so just

00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,670
about me I'm a software engineer at

00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,589
situs data that got acquired by

00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:51,920
Microsoft a few months ago so I'm now

00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:54,400
Microsoft software engineer I before

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:59,059
that I've been a Python developer for

00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:03,619
years and I also really love databases

00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:06,440
as weird as that sounds I kind of tend

00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:08,540
to be more specialized in Postgres I did

00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,570
co-found Postgres women about a year ago

00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:13,369
we you know realized that they were not

00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:16,159
that many women and we kind of wanted to

00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:18,829
prove that we exists and now we're

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:22,070
trying to work a little bit more on you

00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:23,299
know different diversities because you

00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:26,479
know white women are not really

00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:28,880
diversity if you want to follow me on

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,750
twitter i'm louise mehta and i have a

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:36,020
blog and i'm mentioning this blog

00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:38,570
because mostly I did write a very long

00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:41,509
series of article that take the content

00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:43,850
of this talk I wrote the first version

00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:47,210
of this talk about a year and a half ago

00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:49,939
and what I did to prepare for that talk

00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:52,609
was read the entire source code for you

00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:55,640
know indexes in Postgres and that was a

00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:57,979
very painful thing and it was because

00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,069
there was no good content on that

00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:06,079
specific thing so I ended up writing

00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:08,929
what I needed so today we're gonna talk

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,850
about indexes so first I'm gonna give

00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:14,390
you kind of a reminder for those who are

00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:17,750
new to databases and Postgres and Django

00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:19,159
and everything so what are they for and

00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,569
then we'll go through kind of the

00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:23,930
options that you have when you create

00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:24,650
indexes and then we'll go through four

00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,540
different types

00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:31,640
Phoenix's and how they are internally

00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:34,010
implemented in Postgres and I kind of on

00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:37,730
purpose decided to not talk about two

00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:39,409
types which are SPG's and hash because

00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:44,030
I've never met someone who actually

00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:46,220
needs that so yeah so I was talking

00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:49,000
about crocodiles so here is the example

00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:52,430
and when you use to this talk you have

00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,250
crocodiles it's a table that contains

00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,900
you know email first-name lastname

00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:58,909
number of teeth they're important and

00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,790
the last checkup and they can take

00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:06,079
appointment because they need dentist

00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:08,510
appointment and the birds are you know

00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:11,180
the doctors this is like a really

00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:13,609
realistic example because in nature the

00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:16,400
crocodiles you know get their teeth

00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:21,349
clean by birds eating the food so that's

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:25,370
really everything I say is true so what

00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:27,079
are indexes for the first thing I'm

00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,519
going to talk about is constraints I

00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:29,949
know that's not necessarily the first

00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,930
thing you think about when you think

00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:35,150
indexes but constraints are very

00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:38,739
important so when you create a primary

00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:41,359
key or a unique constraint or an exclude

00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:44,269
constraint it will be transformed in the

00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:46,430
database into an index so that you can

00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:48,709
see like if you will connect to your P

00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:51,739
SQL and you look at your table you will

00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:54,049
see indexes appearing that our note as

00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:56,329
primary key or unique constraints here

00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:58,190
here I have a weird exclude that

00:03:56,329 --> 00:04:01,129
prevents the crocodile to take to skip

00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:03,349
two appointments at the same time we

00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:06,079
also use them for optimizing queries

00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:09,889
that's basically often the main reason

00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:12,229
we create index so why are they helping

00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:15,979
yet is that in an index you're going to

00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:18,130
have the value of the road of the column

00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:20,750
that you're indexing and a pointer and

00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:23,330
instead of reading the entire table it's

00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:26,210
going to go to the index and search for

00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:29,000
the value that you're looking for if

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:32,389
that's not clear kind of think about it

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,219
as an encyclopedia if you want to read

00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:36,380
about crocodiles and I'm gonna Rea read

00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:38,029
the entire and completely from A to Z

00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,510
you're just going to go to the index

00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:43,070
look for

00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:47,900
crocodiles and go back to the pages so

00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:49,460
creating indexes to create an index here

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,470
I have this query I've won the

00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,780
crocodiles that have 10 teeth and I want

00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:57,170
to optimize that query it takes about 30

00:04:53,780 --> 00:05:00,080
milliseconds to execute so what I do in

00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:02,480
Django it's really easy in my model I

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,780
just add in the field DB index equal

00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,300
true and it's going to create the index

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:11,620
in the database you can also use raw SQL

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:14,870
I do that a lot so not no judgment here

00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:18,080
you can do create index and then give an

00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:20,330
index name this is optional on the table

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,070
and the column that you're doing and so

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:24,590
here it pretty helps I mean 6

00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:28,630
milliseconds instead of 31 it's pretty

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:32,720
good you can also create unique indexes

00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:34,520
for that again in the field I can here I

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,010
have emails and I want my emails to be

00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,230
unique which kind of makes sense so you

00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:41,930
can just have a unique equal true here

00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:44,540
and rise clearly transforms and to

00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:47,420
create unique index on again you could

00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,430
give a name here so what will happen is

00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:51,800
when you try to insert a row with you

00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:55,370
know twice the value Louise at koco.com

00:05:51,800 --> 00:06:02,060
that's on my real email address it will

00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:04,690
fail with key already exists enough fun

00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:08,180
stuff because that was kind of you know

00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:10,940
basic so you can also create partial

00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:14,150
indexes which is really cool here in my

00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,920
database I have appointments and 95% of

00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:19,070
them have been already done like they've

00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:21,680
you know a bird took care of it so I end

00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:24,200
up with that field on equal true for

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,510
most of my rows and let's say most of my

00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:29,210
queries are going to be on Don equal

00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:31,580
false and I want the emergency level

00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,830
bigger than 8 so basically I would just

00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,440
want what is what appointments are not

00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,540
done and an emergency I could create a

00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,750
simple index like this just on emergency

00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:45,470
level but what I can also do is create

00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:48,380
an index with a condition here and it's

00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:50,360
available from django 2.2 so if you

00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,290
don't use it you'll have to do some rice

00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,780
ql things

00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:58,720
so here I had the condition down equal

00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:02,560
false in my indexes and so it's going to

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:06,430
generate the following thing seeing is

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,870
not the right term but so trade index

00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:11,050
with a we're close

00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:13,450
so why is it great it's great for so

00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:15,790
first the size of my index here is much

00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:18,400
smaller I had 13 megabytes and now it's

00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:20,590
like 350 kilobytes so really smaller and

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,080
also now the time of my career is

00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:26,080
actually 10 times faster than with

00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:28,570
normal index so that really is a good

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,940
trick especially like if you have some

00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:33,310
stop deletes let's say you have a forum

00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,320
you delete the people can delete their

00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,150
messages but you don't you know remove

00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,550
them from a database you mark them as

00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:42,510
deleted this can be the kind of use case

00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:45,400
where partial index is is pretty good

00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:48,760
you can also of course do partial unique

00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,680
indexes again like my email let's say I

00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:54,010
have history and I can't actually have a

00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:58,480
unique in constraint on the entire table

00:07:54,010 --> 00:08:01,210
so I can say for example okay now I had

00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,850
unique constraints on email with a

00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:06,970
condition that is it's been created

00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:11,650
after 2019

00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:16,000
September 1st that is also available

00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:17,830
Django 2.2 and it transforms into create

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,350
unique index again with just a we're

00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,570
close here again it will create a

00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:25,960
various index that will be much much

00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:28,810
smaller so here it's not just saving

00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:31,870
this space that's a very good thing in

00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:34,780
general it's also that you have were

00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:37,300
going to have much faster indexes sorry

00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:40,180
inserts because when you insert and

00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:42,820
there's a unique constraint Postgres

00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:44,380
will go through the the index and check

00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,080
that you're not breaking the constraint

00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:49,390
so having a smaller index will actually

00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,430
help you a lot in terms of performance

00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:53,590
and again if you have self deletes like

00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:56,530
your users they can delete their account

00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:59,530
but they can read join but with a new

00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:01,330
account that's a good thing to do to

00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:04,890
have like a unique index on email where

00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,890
dd-did equal false or something

00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:12,200
GDP or you should just delete the data

00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:16,970
she's just saying so you also have

00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:19,320
multi-column indexes so here I have

00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:23,550
appointment I'm filtering the

00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:25,020
appointment for a specific bird and we

00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:27,780
want to know kind of like just the

00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:31,290
appointment that the the bird did that

00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:33,420
are an emergency and I kind of want to

00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:36,870
optimize that

00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:40,320
so I here I create an index and in

00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:43,320
fields there are two columns so in rice

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,420
QL you do a create index in on table and

00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,450
instead of having just one field you

00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:51,240
have two three four five just don't go

00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:55,410
too crazy about that but you have more

00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:58,310
than one field now to think that you

00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:01,200
have to know about multi-column indexes

00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:04,560
the first thing is that you can actually

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,060
reuse your index the reason is like so I

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,790
decided to do this little thing with

00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,770
colors because it was I wanted to be

00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,530
able to explain that in simple terms so

00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:15,750
if you have your index and so it's

00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,550
indexing the values and here basically

00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,890
have the first column is the profit bird

00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:23,160
ID and the second one is the emergency

00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:25,350
level in the index well you know order

00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:28,050
by plover ID for the first column and

00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:31,380
then for each player birds it will be

00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:34,110
ordered by emergency level so what you

00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:37,350
can see is that here the first column is

00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:40,710
ordered the second is ordered by profit

00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:43,950
bird by emergency level so here it still

00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:46,140
goes six ten ten and then 160 cetera so

00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:49,830
it's actually not ordered overall only

00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:52,170
the first column is so you can reuse

00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:55,500
that index if you're doing a you know

00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:58,710
just a simple filter 12 a bird equals

00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:01,170
value so that would reuse the index it's

00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:05,550
important to note that because you might

00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:07,650
if you need a multi column index then

00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:10,980
you might also want to clean the useless

00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:15,150
indexes that could be just reused by

00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:16,350
this one so that's the first thing the

00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:18,990
second thing that you have to think

00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:23,370
about is that you should put your most

00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:25,470
train column first that means that at

00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:30,420
least try it's not always possible this

00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:33,990
is like very theoretical here I have you

00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:37,410
know seventy five thousand appointments

00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:40,649
that are emergency level bigger or equal

00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:43,200
than nine and I have five appointments

00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:45,779
that are from this bird here when I do

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,959
the index with clever bird and an

00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:50,730
appointment it will look only it will

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:54,959
you know get the five and out of the

00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:57,870
five filter on appointment level emerges

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,580
emergency level sorry if you did the

00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:03,240
opposite it would actually be filtering

00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:05,820
out of 75,000 so you can actually I've

00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,320
had that problem a lot at ciders where

00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,970
people are like how I created that

00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,580
multi-column indexing it actually

00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:14,010
doesn't really help and like let's you

00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:17,490
know try to see actually what order you

00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:23,550
used because that does change a lot and

00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:27,779
so now a little bit of fun with Postgres

00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:30,000
and indexed types the first time the

00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:33,089
first index I'm going to be talking

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,500
about is B trees it's the default index

00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:38,520
so everything that you've seen before

00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:40,380
just B trees nothing crazy about that so

00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:43,700
when you do create index it's just going

00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:47,850
to create a B tree so what is a B tree

00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:50,459
it's a balance tree that's the first

00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:53,610
thing the difference between a balance

00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:56,160
tree and a binary tree is that all the

00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:58,260
so first all the leaves are at equal

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,500
distance from the root this is the root

00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:03,480
these are the leaves and a parent node

00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:06,420
can have multiple children it's not only

00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,579
two so that means that basically the

00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,470
depth of the tree will be smaller which

00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:12,810
is good when you're going to search into

00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:14,670
the tree to kind of limit the amount of

00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:17,970
you know changing the reading head

00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:20,880
between pages so right now I'm talking

00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:23,070
about pages and because I don't want to

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,250
scare anything anyone I'm just gonna say

00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:29,550
a page is basically where everything is

00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:32,610
stored almost in phosphorus it's a 8

00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:38,010
kilobyte data structure it's not nothing

00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:41,070
it's just that the name is page so in an

00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:42,600
index what is a page in what does it

00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,880
contain

00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,040
it contains the block number that is

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,070
going to be used for the pointer it's

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:53,370
going to define a high key and what is a

00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:57,300
high key it's the high basically in that

00:13:53,370 --> 00:14:00,660
page any item will have a value lower or

00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:03,410
equal to the high key and then it has

00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:07,560
items and we'll go through items later

00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:10,050
so I was talking about high key so here

00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:13,140
for example I may be in the back you

00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:17,430
don't see as well I'm sorry I hope you

00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:20,970
do but not sure here I have this page as

00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:23,700
has the high key 16 so it means that I

00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:26,339
will only find crocodiles with 16 or

00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:29,610
less teeth in this one the high key is

00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:31,589
31 so it will be 31 or less and here I

00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,690
don't have a high key because it's the

00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:36,959
last page of the level so you can I

00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:41,959
don't know how many teeth curcuit I will

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:45,000
have it could be like a hundred probably

00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:47,820
and now there are also items and the

00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,470
items basically contains the value and a

00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,079
pointer that was what I was describing

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:54,060
before the value will be basically just

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,250
the value of the of what you indexing of

00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:59,100
the column and the pointer will be in

00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:04,980
the leaves the pointer to the row in the

00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:08,010
parents a pointer to the the children so

00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:10,410
to sum up you have a B trees a balanced

00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:12,480
tree the values that are indexed are the

00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:15,000
values of the rows and I know this

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,459
sounds very trivial and very obvious but

00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,029
it's not the case for every index that's

00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:23,279
why I am saying it the data is torn in

00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:25,110
pages and the pages have a high key and

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:29,640
items that are pointing either church

00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:32,100
hide page or to the row and so war RB

00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:34,320
tree is so good then they're very good

00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,890
for anything where you compare data

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:41,069
attic is it equal bigger lower bigger

00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:43,290
equal and lower than or equal why it's

00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:46,320
basically again like you are indexing

00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:48,840
the value in a structure with height

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,720
he the Heike really matters when it

00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:53,790
comes to the binary search and that's

00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,560
what Postgres is using to search into

00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:58,590
the tree it's going to do binary search

00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,750
so B trees are good for almost

00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:03,420
everything that you want to do like

00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:06,420
really commonly you won't need anything

00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:09,600
else than a bee tree but when you do

00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:16,320
there are other types the second tile is

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:20,090
the one I will talk about is Jin so Jin

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:23,670
is used to index arrays and Jason B

00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:27,360
Tia's vector ts vector for those of you

00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:30,150
who are not necessarily you know don't

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,370
really use that it's full text search in

00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:34,620
Postgres it will basically just

00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:37,830
transform a text into a series of

00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:40,920
vectors of Lex M which is basically just

00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:43,170
the root of the word it sufficient for

00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:46,620
this operators which probably don't mean

00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:48,540
much this is basically anything that

00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:51,300
would be like oh does this array

00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:54,360
contains this value does this array can

00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:58,320
change this array does this element you

00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:00,480
know overlap to that for full-text

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,610
search for examples really good because

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,920
you're going to be wanted really often

00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:08,939
to have like oh does is that word in

00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:11,699
that text or something so here I added a

00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:14,970
new column it's the Hilty since the what

00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:18,900
the crocodiles got hurt and the lava

00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:21,689
bird dentist had to repair so here I

00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:25,530
have I randomly generated this this is

00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:28,640
not my real I think that this would be a

00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:32,040
lot of teeth damaged but yeah

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,820
so I created in index and so how they do

00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,600
that

00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:40,170
Postgres is very good with Django and

00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:43,920
Django is amazing and so you have in

00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:46,800
Django contrib Postgres indexes gene

00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,720
index and basically Django supports all

00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,540
the different types of indexes that

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,540
Postgres provides out of the box so it's

00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:56,490
really easy for you to use that so you

00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,830
can just simply create a gene index with

00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:03,700
the fields if you're using rice trio

00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:08,320
because you love SQL and it's fun i

00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:11,440
guess i mean i do is i yeah

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:15,700
you can do create index using gin that's

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:19,390
how it works so how is it different from

00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:21,700
a b-tree earlier i was telling you oh we

00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:25,000
in the bee tree we just you know index

00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:27,220
the value as it is if we were to use a

00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,040
bee tree on an array it would just index

00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:32,260
the entire array what gin does is that

00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,870
it's going to take the array and split

00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:40,090
it and each value will be an entry in

00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:43,030
the tree each value is unique so here

00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:47,770
what you can see is this is again my

00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:52,660
array of heel teeth and it was actually

00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:54,220
split and so this this you know branch

00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,050
of the tree will contain all the

00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,690
crocodiles that have the chief one

00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:03,700
healed and this one will have the four

00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:06,370
six and whatever it's and the difference

00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,679
is that so in a bee tree each element of

00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:11,530
your table has an item in the leaves

00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:14,650
here instead what there is in the leaf

00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:18,670
is a list of the all the crocodiles that

00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:21,820
have the teeth one healed when you know

00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:23,890
the sometimes the the the the list just

00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:26,320
becomes so big that just doesn't even

00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:29,920
fit in a page anymore and what happens

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,809
in that moment is that what we do is we

00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:36,360
have a passing tree which just contains

00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:40,450
also pointers to crocodiles or rows that

00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:46,900
are just stored in a in a tree instead

00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:50,050
of in the page so here i have the time

00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:52,540
that i if I was this I I showed that

00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:55,150
example because I actually created an

00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:57,670
index a b-tree index too just to show

00:19:55,150 --> 00:20:00,790
that it would actually not even be used

00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:03,460
by PostgreSQL when executing the query

00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:05,620
so here it used to take a hundred sick

00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,929
and 60 millisecond even with an air

00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:11,050
between decks and now it takes forty one

00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:13,040
millisecond and you can see here in the

00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:18,140
bitmap in there's a bit

00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:20,060
index can and on my index for those who

00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,600
of you who don't really know what that

00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,390
come from

00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,640
it's an explained plan that you can

00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:27,560
actually execute on your query with and

00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,930
password scale just to kind of see

00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:35,810
whatever is done when executing a query

00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:38,290
so to sum it up so gin is also a balance

00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:42,430
tree so that's pretty close to be tree

00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:45,260
and each values in the tree is unique we

00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:48,500
instead of just indexing the row we

00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:51,710
split the value and each value is an

00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,500
entry a unique entry in the tree so it's

00:20:51,710 --> 00:21:00,650
very efficient for a full-text search

00:20:53,500 --> 00:21:05,600
and you know overlapping data etc and

00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:07,430
I'm gonna speak about gist so just is an

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,730
index a little is a little bit weird

00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:13,670
because it is a framework so you could

00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:17,870
write your own just index for your own

00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:19,850
data if you have time and patience so it

00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:22,490
provides like if you look into it and

00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:24,320
there are articles on my blog about this

00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,970
but if you look into it there's like a

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,400
list of functions that you could

00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:30,260
implement for any data type that you

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,820
would have and they would do a genetics

00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:36,920
adjust index sorry so what is the

00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:40,430
difference between a gist index and a

00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:44,150
b-tree or a gin the first thing is that

00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:46,540
the data is not ordered in it which

00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:53,330
seems weird but does make sense

00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:57,290
weirdly here I created a weird data type

00:21:53,330 --> 00:22:01,730
for an integer range just to show you

00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:04,610
that in here you can see that here it's

00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:08,150
3 to 5 the range and then here it's 0 to

00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:10,880
2 and here it's 4 th so it overlaps and

00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:13,880
it's not even ordered why is it this way

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,570
if you're using just index it's most

00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:21,080
likely because you're using you know

00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:24,320
cheapest GIS and if you in using

00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:26,470
geometry and everything what happens is

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,510
in a geometry you

00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,340
if you think about it a little bit it

00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:33,250
makes sense that it's almost impossible

00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:36,520
to build a tree on a geometry that just

00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:39,130
never overlaps you know geometry like if

00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,230
you take two big circles it's pretty you

00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:43,540
you will have some overlapping so when

00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:45,640
you build a just index there will be

00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:51,190
overlapping and that's something that

00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:53,470
has to be taken in account so the same

00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:56,799
value can be inserted in several places

00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:58,780
which is why you have if you build your

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,850
own just index you'll have to be very

00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:02,830
careful because you can end up with bad

00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:06,970
performance but you can trust the people

00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:09,160
who build just 4 plus G is when you

00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:12,160
create a just index again very simple

00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:15,669
it's in contrib Postgres indexes you can

00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:21,850
just use just index or again you can use

00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:24,910
create index using just so it's Y usages

00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:26,530
and X for any overlapping you know

00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:30,580
things that you would want to do with

00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:32,830
whether it's geometry array ranges I the

00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:35,500
main test I did with gist for this talk

00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:39,490
was on a TS range and that's a pretty

00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:41,650
good example I think it's well again

00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:44,320
especially used for post GIS and for

00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:47,530
nearest neighbor operations it's also

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:52,299
used very commonly for full-text search

00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:54,760
and there are some very if you you want

00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:57,880
to use you know full-text search and you

00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:00,820
want to use gin or Geist there are

00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,590
several differences between them I don't

00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,990
think I have time to talk about them

00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:07,030
right now so I'm going to pass that if

00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:09,370
you have questions about it I'm happy to

00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:13,419
answer them in the hallway I'll be

00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:17,760
probably hanging out at the booth my not

00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:23,740
Postgres sorry Microsoft where do I work

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:26,280
booth sorry teri it's filmed and the

00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:31,600
last one they will be speaking about

00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:34,059
brain indexes are amazing I love that so

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,960
they are very different because they're

00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:39,740
not even a tree there it's the only

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,080
index that is not a tree so

00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:44,630
it's something that we call block range

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,160
index and what it contains and be

00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:48,500
careful because it's going to be very

00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,620
confusing until and until I show you

00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:53,720
what it is is that it's going to have a

00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:56,540
group of pages that are physically

00:24:53,720 --> 00:25:02,120
adjacent and the range of value that

00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:05,210
this adjacent block range contains so it

00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:07,640
makes brain index is very very small and

00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:11,480
good when you have to fast can like

00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:15,470
really really big tables so what I mean

00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:19,370
with all of that is that here I have a

00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:22,970
brain index on a created at so from for

00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:28,370
the pages from 0 to 128 I have the range

00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:34,070
2008 to 2009 July something then 2028 to

00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:37,640
256 its 2009 2010 something so here you

00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:40,220
can see how a brain index is but be

00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,230
careful because it's not always good in

00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:45,679
this case like if I'm just try looking

00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:48,110
for 2013 but I know it will be here but

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,840
if you want to use it for a birthday

00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:54,440
column that will be terrible because all

00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,510
the ranges will be really big so when

00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,929
you use a brain index you have to be

00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:02,120
careful about having values that or have

00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:05,330
a correlation with the physical location

00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:08,120
of your data so basically any data that

00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:10,490
actually increments would be a good

00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:13,780
thing you also have to be careful about

00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:16,309
deletes because when you delete data

00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:18,230
from you know I don't know two years ago

00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:21,020
whatever and then you vacuumed the

00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:24,350
spaces then reused and then your ranges

00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:26,660
are really bad again so it's something

00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:28,070
to think about when you have you when

00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:31,490
you want to add a brain indexes

00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:35,330
correlation and not delete switch again

00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:38,179
gdpr yeah so when you create a brand X

00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:41,450
again yeah super easy Postgres indexes

00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:46,190
brain index you added to your meta and

00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:49,669
indexes and that's it so conclusion a

00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:53,059
b-tree is great for any comparison

00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:53,700
operators gin are good when it comes to

00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:55,919
array

00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,289
and when it comes full-text search when

00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,049
you have to kind of have oh this array

00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:03,149
contains whatever jstor good for

00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:04,830
overlapping especially for geometry that

00:27:03,149 --> 00:27:08,010
can also be used for full text search

00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:11,450
and Brin are really good when it comes

00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:14,990
to fast scanning large amount of data

00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:14,990
thank you for attention

00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:22,049
all right so we have time for one maybe

00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:23,669
two questions that I was curious about

00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:26,010
Jen you son

00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:27,960
he said JSON be it would be used on JSON

00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:31,230
B specifically I was curious about like

00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:36,029
depth how that's handled can you only

00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:40,440
index on like an array or keys from what

00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:42,510
I remember it's on the keys but you know

00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,630
what I'm not sure because I would guess

00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:49,490
the keys I've only mostly used Jin

00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:51,779
indexes for full-text search actually so

00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:53,789
if you're curious about that they are

00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:56,039
like some pretty good extensions to

00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:57,779
Postgres where you can actually that's

00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:59,940
what I was showing for Brin you can

00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:02,159
actually go and analyze what the pages

00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,389
contain so when it's things like that

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,700
way you don't know exactly what is

00:28:03,389 --> 00:28:08,370
indexed you can use this extensions to

00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:10,139
go and see that all right can you

00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:13,110
elaborate a little bit on how you handle

00:28:10,139 --> 00:28:16,380
the regulatory things like gdpr

00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:18,059
or CCPA like did you hard delete the

00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,919
rows or did you scrub them and if you

00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:24,149
describe them like how did you handle a

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:26,700
certain constraint issues oh okay so

00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:29,279
it's sorry the is the question on

00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:39,419
constraints or on brain and handling a

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:42,330
brain index I'm not sure okay so in my

00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:44,549
company that I worked for before what we

00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:47,250
had was a very complex I think that

00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:51,510
anyone has a complex system where so our

00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:54,000
constraints had conditions for deleted

00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:56,159
accounts and then after six month I

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,690
think of the Nikhil Markus deleted we

00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:01,919
would delete all the data because

00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:03,670
legally we have to I think okay that's

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:07,420
it

00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:20,799
[Applause]
