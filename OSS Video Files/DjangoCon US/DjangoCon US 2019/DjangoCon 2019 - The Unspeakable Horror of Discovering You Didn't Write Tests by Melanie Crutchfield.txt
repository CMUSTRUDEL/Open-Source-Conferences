	DjangoCon 2019 - The Unspeakable Horror of Discovering You Didn't Write Tests by Melanie Crutchfield

PSA: if you don't write tests, you'll instead write code for a time machine to go back & train a band of feisty raccoons to dump grape jelly on the head of your past self because you'll have realized she is a terrible, lazy, awful person.

How do I know?

Because I didn't write tests.
