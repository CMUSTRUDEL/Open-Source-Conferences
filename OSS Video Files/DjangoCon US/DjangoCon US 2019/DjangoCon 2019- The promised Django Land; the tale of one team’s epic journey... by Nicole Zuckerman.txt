	DjangoCon 2019 - The promised Django Land; the tale of one teamâ€™s epic journey from Flask by Nicole Zuckerman

Many orgs change frameworks mid-stream to more or less success; in this talk, you'll get a real-life fairytale of switching from Flask to Django, why each was valuable, how they got team buy-in, what technical decisions made things easier/harder, and how they switched without stopping product work.
