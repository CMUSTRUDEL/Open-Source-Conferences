	DjangoCon 2019 - Generic View? What is that and why would I use it? by Felipe Lee

In this talk I'll discuss Django's generic class-based views (CBVs). I'll go into detail on what they are, how they compare to function-based views, and pros/cons for using them. I plan to go deeper into certain aspects of CBVs, explaining some of the internals of how django defines them.
