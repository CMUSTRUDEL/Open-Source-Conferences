00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:19,730
thanks everyone so hey I'm Dustin quick

00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,380
and true about me so I'm gonna developer

00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,480
advocate at Google that means I

00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,260
represent the Python community

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,930
internally at Google when we build

00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,670
products for Python Easter's I'm also

00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,590
the chair for PI Texas by the way it's

00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:33,320
going to be in Austin this year or next

00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:35,180
year sorry May 16 17 so you should come

00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,290
to Austin come hang out go to PI Texas I

00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,370
also work on the Python package index

00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:43,250
pretty cool Python infrastructure that

00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,330
I'm sure you all use I'm not actually

00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,790
gonna talk about any of those things

00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:48,620
today so we're gonna talk about static

00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:51,949
typing quick pop quiz so everyone in the

00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,839
room is Python dynamically typed or is

00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:57,019
it statically typed so who thinks it's

00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:58,309
dynamically typed and who things that

00:00:57,019 --> 00:01:00,019
like alright this talks about static

00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:02,839
typing a Python it's probably statically

00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:04,330
typed maybe how about who thinks this is

00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:08,510
a trick question

00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:10,490
okay it's kind of a trick question the

00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:13,670
answer is that Python is dynamically

00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:16,579
typed but can optionally be a statically

00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,899
typed as you want it to be so the answer

00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:19,579
to that might not actually make a lot of

00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:22,369
sense if you're not super familiar with

00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:23,539
typing and type systems so that's okay

00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:24,740
that means that you're in the right talk

00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:26,630
if that doesn't make sense to you and

00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,159
we're gonna explain that and the steps

00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,329
to understand answer that question are

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,740
basically this we're gonna talk about

00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:35,359
types in Python type systems in general

00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,219
dynamic typing in Python and then static

00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,539
typing in Python and then once we sort

00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:40,820
of understand what static typing in

00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:42,530
Python means we'll talk about how to use

00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,320
static typing when you should use it and

00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:47,270
when you shouldn't use it so let's talk

00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,119
about types and specifically let's talk

00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:52,009
about type when I say type I mean the

00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:55,880
type built-in in your Python interpreter

00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:57,619
so in your Python repple you could type

00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,929
something like this type 42 and this

00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:02,390
will tell you that 42 is an int it's an

00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:05,450
integer you can also type other things

00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:08,210
so the type of 42.0 is a float type of

00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,860
fluid string type of that is list and

00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:12,200
you might say okay I recognize these

00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:14,330
things that are coming out of the type

00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,280
function these are like the built-ins

00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:19,220
that I can use to change one type to

00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,890
another right so you can take integer

00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,330
like a here and you can sometimes we

00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:26,240
call this casting cast it to a

00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:29,000
float cast it to a string cast it to a

00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,500
really ugly list so who's seen a really

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,850
ugly list like this before where a

00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,140
string is getting turned into a list

00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,420
right okay have you seen that before

00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,980
that's a type error you've had a type

00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,810
error in your code and something that

00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:42,530
was expecting a list got a string

00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:44,330
instead so it would also something like

00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,700
these are the only types available to us

00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,950
but that's not entirely true so these

00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,710
are just basically some mappers to

00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:54,380
classes that exist so interior is just a

00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:57,230
class so I can say the type of 42 is an

00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,000
int I get a class of int from int and is

00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,560
instance 42 int is the same thing as

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,570
doing class matching if something is an

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,060
instance of another class so there are

00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:07,310
more types than just in string float

00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,370
right so there's none type we've all

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:12,320
seen none type before but you can only

00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:15,050
get it by calling type on none there's

00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,540
also a function type so when we define a

00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:20,600
function we don't say like function blah

00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,980
blah we say def function name etc and

00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,770
there's like an ellipses type there's

00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,690
lots of types and in fact if you are in

00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:30,050
your Python wrap one you import types

00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:31,880
you get this whole list of all sorts of

00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:34,130
types of things that you could have in

00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,230
your Python code and so these all live

00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,870
in the types module and they actually

00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:41,269
can be used to instantiate a new thing

00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,590
like whatever this is you can call open

00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:44,510
closed parentheses on it with some

00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,519
arguments and create a new like a new

00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,260
function type but there's a reason we

00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:51,890
don't do this it looks really messy and

00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:53,780
there's like a lot of code to it so when

00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:56,900
we say python is a dynamically typed

00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,940
language what it means is that variables

00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,670
can be any type at all and they can

00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:03,860
change so for example if I imported

00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,330
random and I called random choice on

00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,160
this list of things that are an integer

00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:09,320
or a float in a string and I call type

00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,890
of the result of that what's the result

00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:14,540
like what type is a gonna be it could be

00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,980
any of these right it could be a string

00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,060
and int or float and it depends on the

00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,830
outcome from random

00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,419
so it doesn't matter what I'm putting in

00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:23,630
that variable it can contain any of

00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:25,370
these types dynamic typing also means

00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,740
that the arguments and the return types

00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,870
of functions can also be any type right

00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,870
so the same is true for the arguments

00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,340
and the return values of any function so

00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,220
if I create a function like this frog

00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:40,400
negate takes two three parameters ABC

00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,770
return is a plus B plus C so in Python

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,810
when we write a function like this how

00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,520
do we know that we're getting the type

00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,260
that we're expecting out of it right so

00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,850
if you saw this function and you had no

00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,310
idea what frog Nicki meant because it's

00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,720
a made-up word what would you expect the

00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:56,300
arguments to be here and what would you

00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,400
expect a return type to be so you might

00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,380
say like it might make sense for these

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,090
to be integers right so I define the

00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,740
function I can call from the gate 1 2 3

00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,840
and I get 6 the sum of all these

00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,550
integers but also like a call from

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,050
Nikita with strings I can call from

00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,160
Nikita with 3 strings and it would

00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,290
concatenate those strings

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,020
it's totally valid and it only works the

00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,370
function can return integers or strings

00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,560
however what I can't do is I can't mix

00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,930
these types now because I can't actually

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,400
use the plus operator on a mixture of

00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,440
strings and integers so that blows up

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,360
and that creates a type error so it'd be

00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,770
great if we could say what this function

00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,190
actually is expecting for all these

00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:34,010
arguments on what is expecting to return

00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:36,950
so one thing we could do is write a

00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:38,990
really long and nice doc string doc

00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,610
string that lists all the arguments and

00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:43,550
the return types and what they aren't

00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:45,740
and comments who does this does anyone

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,410
do this does your employer pay you

00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:51,170
enough to do this this takes a lot of

00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,880
work right it's a long comment and you

00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:54,560
know you gotta write it all out

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,940
it also doesn't actually change the

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,950
evaluation of the function area you can

00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,930
still call this with with strings and

00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,640
it's still gonna return the string and

00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:05,210
it's just a little handy guide there for

00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:07,190
the developer we could do this so we

00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:09,770
could write a function we get assert on

00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,180
every single argument that we get do our

00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,220
business logic or whatever we need to do

00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:17,390
and then assert on the return type and

00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:18,620
then actually return it I was I said in

00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,660
a previous talk one time I showed this

00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,620
example I said yeah nobody does this and

00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,440
then someone came up afterwards and

00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:26,360
they're like well actually we do did you

00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,100
do this and so the reason you don't

00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,360
wanna do this is because each assertion

00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,220
well I mean while this works

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,419
each assertion adds just a little bit of

00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,980
overhead to your function call right

00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:36,890
because that happens at runtime each

00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,750
assertion so you know while it's modest

00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,800
there's a small performance problem

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,240
there and also you know it's a little

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,430
bit messy looking to have all those

00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,860
asserts all together so we don't really

00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:48,500
do that what do we do instead in Python

00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,230
we do something called duck typing so

00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,090
instead we

00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,590
duck shaking is if it walks like a duck

00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,690
and it quacks like a duck it's probably

00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:57,400
a duck so we sort of absorb the way that

00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:59,290
we interact with functions and variables

00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,390
and we can sort of infer what the types

00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:04,810
are from that so for example in these

00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:06,760
examples right I'm setting food to list

00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:08,560
comprehension calling f of X on X and

00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,810
bar bar is probably some iterable it's

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,300
something like a list or a string and

00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:15,430
the second line foo is bar greater than

00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,720
zero so bar is probably an inch or

00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,760
something I can compare to an integer

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,040
and foo is going to end up being like a

00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,330
boolean and in the last one bar is

00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,340
something I can call and close

00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,810
parenthesis on but it means it could be

00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,160
a function or it could be a list so I

00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:30,100
could still actually kind of ambiguous

00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,320
what this is and usually if it was if it

00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,490
was a class that was calling or sorry it

00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,540
could be a function over our class if it

00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,430
was a class barb

00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:39,010
we'd probably capitalize it but you know

00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:43,420
not always it's not required so it could

00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:45,460
be anything so static typing means that

00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,840
these variables and the return types and

00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,610
arguments to function are not going to

00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,690
change they're defined what the type is

00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,490
going to be and it's not going to change

00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:54,100
and so there are actually a lot of

00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,870
statically typed languages so I want to

00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,310
show you some examples of that same

00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:59,740
function f R Abenaki function in

00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,470
multiple languages so does anyone know

00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:06,280
which language is this I heard it yeah

00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:07,990
see let's see how about this one Java

00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,770
yeah that's a dead giveaway with like

00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:14,650
public static you know anyone know what

00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:16,000
this one is yeah every time I do this

00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,370
talk and the Russell comes listens like

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,480
yeah that's rust I know rust

00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,340
yeah that's rust because it rust

00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,110
actually has really fine grain that's an

00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:25,420
unsigned 8-bit integer for the argument

00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,890
types there so you can say exactly what

00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:32,110
type of integer it is not just an

00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:33,760
integer how about this one I heard

00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:36,220
JavaScript but it's actually typescript

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,060
it's typed of JavaScript the way the way

00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,130
you would know is that JavaScript

00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,020
actually has only one number type it's

00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:43,330
number like in the floats and integers

00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,830
everything is a number okay so you can

00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:47,290
sort of put languages into columns right

00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:49,540
dynamic languages are like Python Ruby

00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:52,510
closure and JavaScript static are like

00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,620
see rust and typescript and actually you

00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,880
have to put you know like a little

00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,980
asterisk next to python and we're going

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,080
to talk about why because you can do

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,000
some static typing things in python and

00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,509
also technically ruby is going to also

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,609
get the same thing that python

00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:08,789
but not until end of next year so we'll

00:09:05,609 --> 00:09:11,639
ignore that so like I earlier said

00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:13,499
Python is dynamically typed but can

00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:16,939
optionally be a statically typed as you

00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:18,959
wanted to be so the story of that

00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:20,489
becoming true that wasn't always true

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,349
right there was a point in time when

00:09:20,489 --> 00:09:24,899
Python was a purely a dynamically typed

00:09:22,349 --> 00:09:26,729
language and the story of Python

00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,379
becoming a language you could optionally

00:09:26,729 --> 00:09:31,379
stack the typed is also kind of the

00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:33,119
story of the evolution of code at

00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:37,709
Dropbox does anyone work at Dropbox you

00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:39,119
know so so Dropbox is large tech company

00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:41,129
and they're a Python shop also and they

00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:43,079
have millions of lines of Python code

00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:45,689
and basically at a certain point in

00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:47,609
their evolution as a company they

00:09:45,689 --> 00:09:49,919
realize that the fact that their Python

00:09:47,609 --> 00:09:52,109
code was lacking any kind of type system

00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:54,029
and type annotation it was actually

00:09:52,109 --> 00:09:55,679
slowing him down like was causing their

00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:56,609
developers to be less productive when

00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,679
they were looking at code because

00:09:56,609 --> 00:10:00,959
there's so much of it so intertangled

00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:02,759
there's so many different like areas of

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,409
the code base and so they actually wrote

00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:05,879
a blog post you can go and find it on

00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:08,039
their blog it's super good and talks

00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:11,099
about sort of a little bit about the

00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:12,089
history of static typing at Dropbox but

00:10:11,099 --> 00:10:13,349
I'm gonna actually talk about the

00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:15,239
history of snacked editing Python which

00:10:13,349 --> 00:10:17,219
steps back a little bit from the start

00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:21,209
of it at Dropbox and so the start of it

00:10:17,219 --> 00:10:23,759
in Python starts here at pep 3107 this

00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:26,639
is the functions annotations pet we got

00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,929
this in 2006 and only in Python 3 and

00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:29,699
what this allowed us to do is take a

00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:32,059
function like this which is the same one

00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:35,039
I showed before and then we can add

00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:38,279
annotations any metadata that we want to

00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,449
the arguments and to the return type so

00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:41,849
these are types this is just like

00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:43,289
literally any Python code you want you

00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:45,569
could put in the annotation for this

00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:47,249
function and this has zero effect on the

00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:50,849
execution of the function what it does

00:10:47,249 --> 00:10:53,339
instead was it gives you this annotation

00:10:50,849 --> 00:10:55,559
stunned or annotations attribute and

00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,969
what it would do is evaluate the value

00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:58,799
of all those annotations would execute

00:10:56,969 --> 00:11:01,139
the annotations and so here it would say

00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:03,269
like ok a has this annotation a string

00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:07,499
of X B I've added five and six so now

00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:09,989
it's 11 C N and the return annotation so

00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:12,539
this is interesting and in the pet they

00:11:09,989 --> 00:11:14,939
sort of outlined some uses for these

00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:16,420
annotations right so all the uses kind

00:11:14,939 --> 00:11:18,100
of basically boil down to

00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,930
you can do interesting typing things

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,250
with it and then also like maybe or you

00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,470
could use it for documentation but you

00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:25,660
probably use it for types but it didn't

00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:27,370
really specify a way to use it for types

00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:30,490
but we could imagine doing something

00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:32,500
like this with it where in the

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,089
annotation we just write put the type

00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,980
there right we say a is an NP isn't in

00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:38,410
see isn't in returns an int and so when

00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:41,170
I look at the annotations I see what all

00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:42,579
of those are supposed to be however just

00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,079
because like an antique function again

00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:46,089
doesn't mean I can actually evaluate

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,529
whether that function is being used

00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:49,870
correctly elsewhere like Python is not

00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:51,550
gonna look at these annotations and at

00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:53,290
runtime and figure out if they're right

00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,300
or wrong it's being called correctly so

00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:57,010
it only gives us a way to annotate this

00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,720
function and actually only functions - I

00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:02,290
can't annotate the variables with this

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,610
it's only for functions so a little bit

00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,620
around the same time

00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:07,720
eucalyptus Lo is working on his PhD

00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,000
thesis at University of Cambridge and

00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,680
his PhD thesis was about this is about

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,570
the unification of a statically typed

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,100
and the dynamically typed language

00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:17,889
basically how could you have a language

00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:20,199
that had both and the goal was to be

00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:21,760
able to use the same language for

00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:23,620
everything from a tiny script where you

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,110
don't really care about typing that much

00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:28,600
to like a sprawling multi-line codebase

00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:30,970
where like Dropbox you start to actually

00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,860
care about typing and he had this idea

00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,360
of gradual growth where you could go

00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,880
from something that was untyped and

00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,170
slowly add type annotations optionally

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,579
where you needed it until you had

00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:43,390
something that was fully statically

00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:46,149
typed so he published a paper his thesis

00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:47,709
in 2011 and in and he concluded this he

00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:49,449
said that adding a static type system to

00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:51,250
a dynamically typed language could be a

00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:53,410
totally invasive change requires

00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,360
coordinated modification of like

00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,529
everything basically the program that

00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,010
runs behind the virtual machines all the

00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:01,839
tools everything you also said that you

00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,880
could optionally do an optional an

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,199
optional pluggable type system that

00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,120
doesn't actually affect the runtime of

00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:09,790
the program and is basically a layer on

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,680
top of the the program and wouldn't

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:14,019
require this modification of all the

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,510
existing tool sets so this sounds really

00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:19,209
great without having to change Python it

00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:22,870
would be awesome so in 2013 he gave a

00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:25,329
talk at PyCon us and he introduced

00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:27,970
something called my PI so if you are

00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:29,390
familiar with my PI you this is probably

00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,220
not what you're familiar

00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,110
when he introduced it at the time this

00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:35,510
is what my pie was my pie is an

00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,770
experimental variant of Python that

00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:39,010
supports writing programs that

00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:42,860
seamlessly mix dynamic and Static typing

00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:45,080
so this was not what you think it was my

00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,490
pie now my pie you think of now as a

00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,800
static type checker at the time it was

00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:51,440
actually a variant of Python itself it

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,180
was its own language and so in his

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,710
research he actually he didn't even use

00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,990
Python as an example he made up a

00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:58,970
language sort of as a toy language to

00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:00,980
show that this was actually possible so

00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:02,930
my PI the language actually looked like

00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:05,930
this and it kind of looks like Python it

00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:07,460
was definitely inspired from Python but

00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,350
it had some extra stuff to allow him to

00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:12,290
do variable annotations and better

00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:14,360
function annotations because at the time

00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:17,150
all we had was function notations so he

00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,800
gave this presentation at PyCon and he

00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:20,690
said he gave the presentation and he

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,910
talked to Gyo about Anki I was like yeah

00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:24,410
just ditch this dish the variable

00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:27,530
variant language like let's just do this

00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:29,270
in Python proper and so he said okay so

00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:31,790
he did just convince him to drop the

00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:33,680
custom syntax and stick to just Python

00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:35,510
free where we have function annotations

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,770
and we can do some other stuff as well

00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:41,540
so in 2014 we got at 43 and this was

00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:43,910
Guiteau writing down basically his

00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:47,060
theory of type hints like how typing

00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:50,120
should work in Python so there were some

00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:52,610
big ideas here one was sort of drew from

00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,710
us Yuka's paper one was optional typing

00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,510
adding annotations to their runtime

00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:58,820
shouldn't affect the actual runtime of

00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:01,520
your program so like I said before an

00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:03,620
unattended run exactly the same as an

00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,140
annotated function I think this sort of

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,480
stills from lessons that we learned in

00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,770
the Python two to three migration right

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,140
we don't want to introduce this huge

00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:15,050
breaking change across Python versions

00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,190
we want it to be sort of like gradual

00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:18,410
and available if you want it but not

00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:20,840
going to get in your way the other was

00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:23,120
gradual typing so let's not try to do

00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,620
this all at once right typing a giant

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,910
code base is going to be impossible to

00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,940
do all at once you should be able to do

00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,170
little pieces at a time he also

00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,670
introduced the idea of variable

00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:33,110
annotation so this was building on the

00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:35,480
idea of function annotation so that we

00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,500
could annotate variables as well and so

00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,720
that would mean that we could have a

00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,430
function like this and we could add a

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,890
little comments as the type of this

00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:45,080
variable I've just defined is and

00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:47,750
this also meant that we could do type

00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:49,220
hinting in Python too so the syntax for

00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,520
function annotations only came to Python

00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,430
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,870
but because even those on like a super

00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:55,910
old version I thought and still deserve

00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,710
to be able to do to the static typing we

00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:59,930
were able to take these type of type

00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:01,760
comment annotations and backport them to

00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:04,280
Python 2 and sort of get the same

00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,660
behavior so in Python 3 we can actually

00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,700
put them in line with the function

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,320
annotations in Python 2 we can just

00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,960
write a comment underneath of the

00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:14,480
function declaration and have the type

00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,820
annotation there you also introduce some

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,050
ideas for special type constructs so

00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,730
these are building blocks that we

00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,740
actually need to do typing that aren't

00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,720
already available in Python so these are

00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:26,990
things like any-any is a type that

00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,870
matches literally anything Union would

00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:32,150
be this thing can be a type of one type

00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:34,220
or another type optional means that it's

00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:36,770
an alias for union of some type and none

00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,930
a tuple would be a tuple type with

00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:41,060
specific types inside of it callable

00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:43,430
similar so this means that we could

00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:45,350
define a function like this where ramnik

00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:47,870
eight takes an integer an integer but

00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:50,510
the last argument could be a float or it

00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:52,340
could be an integer and the same thing

00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,750
with for the return type right so this

00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,700
would allow us to statically type this

00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:58,640
function and actually say exactly what

00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:00,320
those those arguments would be it also

00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,960
defines some container types so these

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,300
would be like a list or a set and this

00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,040
allows us to sort of say like ok I'm

00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,079
initializing this list and it can only

00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,630
contain integers or I'm initializing

00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:14,510
this dictionary and the key is a string

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,860
and the value is an integer and so that

00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:17,240
would cause the type checker to either

00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,880
pass or fail and in the various

00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,680
situations they also define some generic

00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,540
types for when a class or function

00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,069
behaves in a generic manner so that'd be

00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,390
like an iterable right if I just want to

00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:28,339
say like this function takes anything

00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:31,010
that I can iterate on like a string or a

00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:34,400
list or whatever I just call it an

00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:35,900
interval its generic across all types it

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,940
also defines the relationship between

00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,330
type subtypes and classes so like I said

00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,370
before a type is basically just a class

00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:44,750
so like one just before we just get a

00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,670
class out of it that means that I can

00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:50,360
define a class as well and that just

00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:52,400
becomes a type so when I instantiate a

00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:55,710
foo here I just get the type which is

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,590
the class I use to instantiate it

00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:02,700
so for INT like inches both a class and

00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:04,980
a type here I can create this another

00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,680
class like user ID this is still a

00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,360
custom class but also still a type and

00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,520
then it's important to note that things

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,920
like those special type constructs are

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,600
are not also classes that we can stand

00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,370
she ate it right you can initialize a

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,880
union of a string and an integer it

00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:22,770
doesn't really make a lot of sense and

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,390
we can define type aliases so this is

00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:26,100
nice if we want to just definitely

00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:27,840
pretend like we're JavaScript and have a

00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:31,170
number type that just is every single

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,990
number available to us and then after he

00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:36,630
did Pet 43 he did pet 484 so this is

00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:38,700
type int and this basically standardizes

00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:41,250
everything in pet 483 and it basically

00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,380
standardizes on what my PI's behavior

00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:47,040
and at this point my PI is kind of like

00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:48,930
just the type checker and so pet 484 is

00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,930
how to build a type checker for Python

00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:54,660
and this was all released in Python 35

00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:56,490
in 2015 so I had Pet 44 support had a

00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,530
typing module that we could import from

00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:01,520
get those special type constructs and

00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:03,960
then we kept going so in pet 526 we got

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,420
syntax for variable variable annotations

00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,100
so using the comments in Python 3 felt

00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:10,230
kind of janky and it also had some

00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:12,180
problems so like I said before you can

00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:14,640
initialize an empty list and set the

00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,660
type on that list there's it was kind of

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,920
messy when we tried to instantiate

00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,780
something that we didn't want to set to

00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,300
a value yet we kind of had to give it an

00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:23,730
initial value if we wanted to type it

00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,780
and so the variable annotations let us

00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,180
do things like this we put the

00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,800
annotation in line if it didn't have an

00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,240
initialization value we could just set

00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,650
the annotation and then just not

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,570
initializing the variable at that point

00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:35,160
and the same is true for like class

00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,570
variables we had like the ability to

00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,270
instantiate class variables and things

00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:41,460
that was available in Python 3 6 and

00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:43,200
this almost had everything we needed to

00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:46,890
do static typing in Python

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,480
except we needed a type checker so this

00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:50,310
is the last piece of the puzzle and at

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,560
this point we kind of also we have myapi

00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:53,700
but there are also other static type

00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,130
checkers available as well

00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,380
so there are two types static versus

00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:01,230
dynamic so static type checker is going

00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,880
to run while your code is at rest it's

00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:05,160
going to actually run across your static

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,800
code base and infer all the types from

00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,280
just from code a dynamic type checker is

00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,290
going to

00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,730
sit with your code at runtime and infer

00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:14,100
types kind of like those asserts that we

00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:15,450
were doing before so most of the type

00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:19,350
checkers I'm going to talk about our are

00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:21,060
static so by this point my PI had become

00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:22,950
like it's no longer a variant it's a

00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:25,470
tool that's the type checker here that's

00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:28,170
released on pi PI and you could run out

00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:30,630
like this you could pip install my PI to

00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:32,490
find some file that has some bad typing

00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,920
in it and I could run my pile on that

00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:36,570
file and it will say okay you said that

00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,460
three arguments are integers but you're

00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:40,970
calling them with strings this is a type

00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:43,500
error and I'm gonna give you a warning

00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:45,210
so there's lots of static type checkers

00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,090
like I said they all support and

00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:49,530
implement pet 484 so there's my PI

00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,680
that's mostly you supported by Dropbox

00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:53,730
at this point PI type is from Google

00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,200
hires from Facebook PI right from

00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:57,030
Microsoft high charm actually has its

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,710
own built-in sag type checker which is

00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:00,360
kind of cool but also like you can

00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:02,490
integrate your editor whatever your

00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,900
editor is with all of these other type

00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,280
checkers as well and then there's a

00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,380
bunch of dynamic ones but again they

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,210
have some overhead at runtime so they're

00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:11,490
not you know generally preferred I think

00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:13,260
so disclaimer I work at Google so I will

00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:15,510
talk about PI type just a little bit too

00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,490
it's also available on pi PI and the

00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:18,690
inevitable question between when you're

00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:20,550
looking at all these type checkers is

00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:22,500
like what is the difference between them

00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:25,050
and since they all implement this this

00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,030
path is standard like what what's the

00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:29,190
actual difference here so the difference

00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:30,630
between my PI and PI type there's

00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,820
basically two things I'm going to point

00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:34,770
out one is what I'll call cross function

00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,330
inference and the other is runtime

00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:38,220
lenience so they basically have two

00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:42,120
different philosophies about when they

00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:44,190
should raise errors so cross function

00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,590
inference means that if I define a

00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:48,420
function and I one function returns a

00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,770
string and the other tries to take the

00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,660
output from that function and do

00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:55,650
something that would be a type error at

00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:58,020
runtime if I run this example it's gonna

00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:00,000
raise a tight there and if every with my

00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,960
PI nothing happens because my mind

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,540
doesn't actually have the ability to

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,710
infer across functions that I that one

00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,000
function is gonna return the string and

00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,100
the other function is trying to use that

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,960
as a string if I run it with PI tight

00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,250
high type though it will raise an error

00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,560
it will say this is going to produce an

00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,960
error when you try to run this function

00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:18,810
you probably want to fix it the kind of

00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:21,030
the opposite is that my my PI is going

00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:22,170
to be really strict when you define its

00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,490
types

00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,110
and the pie type is gonna say if this

00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:27,210
doesn't actually produce a runtime error

00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:28,980
I'm not gonna raise a problem so here I

00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:32,130
have a function that's supposed to

00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:33,809
return a list of strings but in in the

00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:37,590
function I'm appending an integer to it

00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:39,330
and I'm returning that my PI is gonna

00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,770
look at this and say this list is

00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:42,900
supposed to only contain strings and

00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:44,760
you're putting an Internet so when I run

00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,520
this like it works totally fine my PI

00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,740
our PI type is gonna say yeah no problem

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,390
that's not gonna create a runtime error

00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,490
but my PI is gonna raise an error and

00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:54,690
say you tried to do something to this

00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:57,510
list and I thought that it was gonna

00:22:54,690 --> 00:23:00,710
have a different type all right so why

00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:03,330
why and when should we use static typing

00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:05,730
so first I'll say when you shouldn't use

00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:07,919
static typing basically never there's

00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,910
not really a point in time when snacks I

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,590
think it's gonna hurt you

00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:13,140
again it's like optional and it doesn't

00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:15,179
affect the runtime of your program the

00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:17,580
one time that maybe you shouldn't choose

00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:20,700
to use static typing is to replace your

00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:23,010
unit tests so there is sort of a school

00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,120
of thought here that that sometimes you

00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,320
write unit tests and they kind of just

00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,549
look like you're doing type checking

00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,280
right you're making assertions on the

00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:30,570
way you're calling the function and and

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,309
then that's kind of true because you

00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:34,260
know tests are some ways kind of like a

00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:36,150
bad type system but in reality like

00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,980
don't replace your unit tests with

00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:40,890
static typing you probably should just

00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:43,620
do both here so when should you use

00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:45,630
static typing basically use it liberally

00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,760
use it as much as possible it's good for

00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:49,830
you so you should use static typing when

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,380
you're millions lines of scale so I'm

00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:54,230
not sure anyone's code base is currently

00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:57,390
millions lines of scale right now here

00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:59,460
but basically you know Dropbox found

00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:01,679
that when you're at that scale and that

00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,780
Python it's actually a liability that

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,640
Python is not sadly typed the the

00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:07,260
overhead to understand that much Python

00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,720
code that doesn't have type annotations

00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:12,360
is so high that it actually affects

00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,860
productivity so that's why companies

00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,570
like Google and Facebook and Microsoft

00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,100
and Dropbox have all invested in these

00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:18,840
type checkers and have started stack the

00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,059
typing their code because it actually is

00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,370
worth doing for them because they have

00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:25,890
90 lines code so basically like there's

00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:28,140
this graph you can imagine where as your

00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:30,900
lines of code go up your desire to add

00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:32,730
type annotations increases and but your

00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,849
ability to added the ease of adding it

00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:35,979
goes

00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:38,679
so you know you're all probably here

00:24:35,979 --> 00:24:40,149
maybe you should migrate and ad side

00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:41,769
typing probably about here in the graph

00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:43,119
that's one it's easiest this is when

00:24:41,769 --> 00:24:45,820
you're probably gonna do it

00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:48,460
but that's okay you'll still be able to

00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:50,169
do it anyway you should also use that

00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:52,960
typing just like when your code is

00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:54,729
confusing so let's be honest everyone

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,479
has written some confusing code at this

00:24:54,729 --> 00:25:00,220
point it has been said that annotations

00:24:58,479 --> 00:25:01,960
are basically like machine verified

00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,549
documentation right it's something that

00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,460
your developers can look at and

00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:09,460
understand what types are available to

00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:11,200
them in their function but also you can

00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,460
run a type checker on it and verify that

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,200
that's actually the way it's being used

00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,970
so if you feel like you need to document

00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,220
the input and output types of your

00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:20,229
function or your your class or whatever

00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:23,679
that is a good indicator that you should

00:25:20,229 --> 00:25:24,999
probably just add some static typing you

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,470
should use static typing when your code

00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:27,940
is for public consumption so like if

00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:30,129
it's a module you're going to put on pi

00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:32,889
PI adding type annotations help

00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:36,669
developers know how to use your API also

00:25:32,889 --> 00:25:39,009
helps your IDs figure out how to do auto

00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:40,629
completion and things like that and then

00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:42,369
also if your users are doing static

00:25:40,629 --> 00:25:44,679
typing in their code and they want to

00:25:42,369 --> 00:25:46,119
use your library they're gonna love it

00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:49,649
because the static typing is going to be

00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:51,639
available to them as well for your code

00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:55,149
you should use static typing before

00:25:51,639 --> 00:25:56,799
migrating or refactoring so you know add

00:25:55,149 --> 00:25:58,210
some static typing in a place where

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,669
you're about to do some refactoring and

00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:01,749
then go make your changes and then run

00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:03,309
your type checker and make sure that

00:26:01,749 --> 00:26:04,840
you're still calling everything in a way

00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:06,220
that's consistent with the types of you

00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,309
would set up before you did that

00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:11,649
migration you could do static typing

00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:14,019
just to experiment with static typing to

00:26:11,649 --> 00:26:16,149
write like I said it doesn't hurt you

00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:19,269
can try it out now if you have a modern

00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:21,659
version of Python yeah it's it's totally

00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:24,609
valid so just experiment with it and

00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:25,779
finally you can use static typing if

00:26:24,609 --> 00:26:27,609
you're just cold

00:26:25,779 --> 00:26:30,249
Gary Bernhardt says static types are a

00:26:27,609 --> 00:26:32,259
warm blanket that I have missed so much

00:26:30,249 --> 00:26:34,239
and by the way Gary's background on

00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:37,450
Twitter is like the best thing right now

00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:39,970
here lies Gary stung by type errors all

00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:42,070
right so to wrap up how do you static

00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:44,979
typing in Python in just five easy steps

00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:46,540
so first you you could this is optional

00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:48,580
but you could migrate to Python

00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:51,190
modern version of Python you can do type

00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,780
annotations type comments in any Python

00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:55,600
version you can still do in Python too

00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:57,400
but in Python 3.6 are above you'll get

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,929
variable annotations function

00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,700
annotations and everything else as well

00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:03,220
and you should probably be migrating

00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,809
anyway let's be honest you can install

00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:06,580
type checker locally I don't care which

00:27:04,809 --> 00:27:07,870
one you can install multiple ones if

00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:10,210
you're interested in trying out multiple

00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:11,559
ones yeah installed locally and

00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:12,970
integrated into your editor right you

00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:14,440
can actually make it so that the type

00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:16,809
checker will run whenever you open

00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:19,030
python file in your code and just check

00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:20,350
out that file and if you as soon as you

00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:22,090
start adding type annotations that will

00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:24,790
start telling you if you're using them

00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:26,080
correctly or not and then you can start

00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:28,059
optionally type in your code base right

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,070
start with maybe like your most

00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:31,540
confusing and hairiest files you can

00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:33,400
start with the easiest things to type

00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:35,380
check as well remember you don't have to

00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:38,080
do it all at once so you can just start

00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:40,929
in some place do a gradual pick the

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,700
critical areas and start there and then

00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:46,000
once you get to the point where you have

00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,320
some some type checking in your code you

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,990
can run type checker when you lint your

00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:52,059
program and finally convince all your

00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:53,650
co-workers to join you in static typing

00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:55,330
if you need help convincing them to join

00:27:53,650 --> 00:28:01,210
you you can show them this talk on

00:27:55,330 --> 00:28:03,130
youtube so thanks everyone thank you

00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:04,630
testing destined for your talk you're an

00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:08,160
excellent speaker I wish I could travel

00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:10,150
the country to listen to you talk I

00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,400
accidentally found static typing the

00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:14,620
other day I imported well I found out

00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:18,970
that I had to import the class in order

00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:21,850
to statically type a function and then I

00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:24,790
got a recursive import error and I

00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:26,500
realized that when I start to import all

00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:29,200
of the types across all of the

00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,850
application to statically type all of

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,520
the functions I was probably going to

00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:35,110
get a lot of I think they're called

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,270
recursive import Arizona's wonder if you

00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:41,500
have any thoughts on on that sort of

00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:43,450
import and recursion yeah yes so the

00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,280
issue is that you have some custom types

00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:47,049
and classes and stuff to find you have

00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:50,260
it in your code and you need to import

00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:51,460
it to define the types in some function

00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,980
but it hasn't actually like you're doing

00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,299
a recursive important so the one thing I

00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:58,900
will say about when you start to add

00:28:55,299 --> 00:29:00,090
static typing to your application it

00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,590
does sort of in two key

00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:04,020
to you which parts of your codebase are

00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:06,510
not very well written not saying that

00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:08,309
you've written bad code but it will like

00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:10,289
when you sit down to annotate a function

00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:12,960
and you're like man this is really hard

00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:14,549
to add the typing like I don't confuse

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,440
dand like my pie is really complaining

00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:17,940
about I can't get it right it probably

00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,770
means that that function is not well

00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:21,750
written like the arguments are ambiguous

00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:25,860
or it's receiving more than the or

00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:28,080
not specific to circular imports so what

00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:29,669
you can do in my pie and we're in all

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,730
the type checkers you can use strings

00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:34,559
instead of the actual classes themselves

00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:36,059
so yeah if you have circulate circular

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,799
imports like that you don't actually

00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:39,529
need to import them to define the type

00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:42,809
for them you can use a string instead

00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:43,830
and it also sort of and a lot of it

00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:46,590
depends on the leg your code base is

00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:50,820
structured but yeah that's a great

00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:52,980
question any more questions yes if you

00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:56,100
can make a really brief funny because we

00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:59,610
want to go for lunch you guys can always

00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:01,679
talk to him in the hallway yes thank you

00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:04,529
very much just Dustin for your great

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:08,610
talk I'm a big fan of the static typing

00:30:04,529 --> 00:30:11,580
in Python how do you feel about Django

00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:13,710
and personally when I've used the

00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:16,830
Taipings I I've used a plug-in called my

00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:21,510
PI django to bring in the types yeah and

00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:23,940
I'm not aware of any motion but I'd like

00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:25,590
to see the types in the Django codebase

00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:29,220
would you agree and is there an

00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:33,659
initiative to get that move in so I can

00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:35,159
I'm not like really I can't say this too

00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:37,799
loudly but I'm actually really a Gengo

00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:39,059
developer by thunder

00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:40,890
I do know a little bit about what's act

00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:43,020
I think looks like in Django so I think

00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:44,789
there is some ideas maybe about adding

00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,409
static types to Django Kobus itself but

00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:51,029
the nice thing that I didn't mention is

00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:52,649
that so Python the folks that work on my

00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:54,539
PI also shipped this project called type

00:30:52,649 --> 00:30:55,980
shed and that's the type annotations for

00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:57,840
everything across the standard library

00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:00,149
basically you can add type annotations

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,820
external to any third-party package or

00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:03,539
library so there is a project I am

00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,610
forgetting what it's called it's

00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:07,200
basically like Django type annotations a

00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:10,350
third party project that has type

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,549
annotations for a significant portion of

00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,240
the Django codebase for a specific

00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:15,850
version of Django

00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:18,450
so that is something that you could use

00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:20,890
to get these type annotations for Django

00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:23,080
from what I have heard there's some

00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:25,960
magic happening inside of Django that

00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:27,340
causes it to be difficult to do type

00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:30,550
annotations basically the way that

00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:32,080
models and things are defined so my

00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:33,730
understanding and this is like a very

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,740
high level understanding is that it is

00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:37,450
sometimes challenging to add type

00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,220
annotations to some parts of your Django

00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:42,130
application but generally I mean you can

00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:43,750
use it in non jangly parts of it as well

00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:45,460
right like it you don't have to exactly

00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:47,559
take everything in your code base in

00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:48,850
order to use to get the benefits cool

00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:51,490
thank you very much thank you

00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:55,410
thanks for question all right let's give

00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:55,410
another round of applause to mr. Bester

00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:09,029
