00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:21,830
right hello

00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:23,450
Who am I I'm Carlton Gibson um I'm a

00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,550
longtime Django user maintain engagement

00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,900
kangaroo's framework along with friend

00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,930
will Vincent we do a podcast called

00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:32,360
Django chat please listen but mostly

00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:35,809
along with my colleague Marius feliz

00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,879
feliz yak I am Django fellow once the

00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:39,650
Django fellow well we are contracted by

00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:42,199
the jangly software foundation to do the

00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:44,989
day-to-day tasks that run the framework

00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:47,750
so we do triaging tickets we do pull

00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:50,120
request review review we do security we

00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,100
do releases we kind of like the janitors

00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,720
we do the stuff that on a project the

00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:57,049
size of Django size just wouldn't happen

00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:59,000
and the idea of that is that it lets the

00:00:57,049 --> 00:01:02,600
contributors that's you do the fun stuff

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,690
which is coding which is making

00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,640
contributions to Django so last year I

00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,830
did a talk just like this one and I said

00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,010
your web framework needs you now you can

00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:14,330
walk sorry I still haven't got the had a

00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,490
bit of a year haven't still got the

00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:19,939
Django Pony cosplaying Lord kitchen and

00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:21,500
I wanted for this but I gave you a

00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:23,030
rundown and say to play how we're trying

00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,359
to open up contributions from across the

00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,259
community and how you could get involved

00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,939
well this year I'm gonna give you an

00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:31,250
update and the update teased the bottom

00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:34,070
line is yes we still do need you right

00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,429
come on get involved so what's the state

00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,740
of play

00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:39,590
last year we this was the state of play

00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,630
we had 1328 open accepted tickets on the

00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,030
framework that seems like quite a lot

00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:47,929
this year we've got twelve hundred and

00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:51,289
sixty two now I'm like yes yes that's

00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:55,369
less now you might not think that that's

00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:57,200
much 1328 three percent I don't know

00:01:55,369 --> 00:02:00,049
right but in the last year there have

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,390
been over a thousand new tickets opened

00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:04,789
on Django so we've closed all of them

00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:07,579
and some so I think that's a massive

00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:09,080
achievement right we've had over 1200

00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:12,530
commits to the Django's master branch

00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,180
from 290 separate contributors right now

00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,740
there will always be some contributors

00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,180
who do more but we've had new

00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:20,420
contributors and we've had more

00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,640
contributors overall so I'm like yes but

00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,750
I look at that 1,200 and I think there's

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,010
still more to do

00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,239
right so I just wanna break it down

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,129
slightly for you I don't know how where

00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,840
you can see this don't worry don't try

00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:33,659
and read it it this is broken down by

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,890
components so then 1200 1200 tickets you

00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:36,450
go to the Django issue tracker it's

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,519
overwhelming but you can break it down

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,440
by component now the biggest one on the

00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:44,069
left there is the ORM so if you know a

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,110
lot about databases come and help the

00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:48,150
next of that is the Django admin if you

00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,650
use the Django admin it's the most of

00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,540
these aren't difficult tickets it's just

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,250
that they're time-consuming right so you

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,260
could come on you could make some big

00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,870
differences to the Django admin there I

00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,459
don't know become an expert on one of

00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,079
these ones further down become an expert

00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:02,640
on the cash from framework 15 tickets

00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:03,930
well 15 tickets is probably addressable

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,459
you could become an expert there you

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,590
could take on those tickets you could

00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,540
make a real difference to Django okay

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,489
the one I want to just quickly focus on

00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,140
for you here it's the third column which

00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:16,650
is documentation tickets that number

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,599
goes over em admin documentation okay

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,819
documentation tech tickets there are a

00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:24,180
hundred nineteen documentation tickets

00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:27,239
now these I don't know do you have good

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,579
written English you do you know if you

00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,230
do then these are perfect opportunities

00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:33,480
to get involved they are a great

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:35,370
learning opportunity because to solve a

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,410
documentation ticket you have to go and

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,750
understand something and then you have

00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,400
to praise it nice and clearly and and

00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,620
make the pull requests on the dogs and

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,840
it's not like you're writing doc six you

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,010
know eggs Neela you're you're tweaking

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,260
and error in the docs or you're

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,630
clarifying something so come on and join

00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,700
us in the documentation tickets right

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:56,609
another great place which is relate

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,319
directly related to this is needs

00:03:56,609 --> 00:03:58,709
documentation there are tickets in the

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,660
dreck

00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:01,680
where we get a PR and we get a PR

00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,470
perhaps from someone whose native

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,970
language isn't English and so they might

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,310
not be able to write the docs very well

00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,230
so the P aren't gets stuck we ticket we

00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,299
review it it's like yeah the codes okay

00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,590
but it needs documentation now if you've

00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:15,299
got good English you could come along

00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,160
find those tickets there's a hundred or

00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,620
some of them and you could come along

00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,690
and you could finish off the PR you

00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,460
could get credited as a co-author and

00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,410
wait there's another hundred tickets we

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,900
could clear off there so just as an

00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,699
example of where there really is an

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,190
opportunity for you to make a difference

00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:34,130
if you couldn't you know put together a

00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,539
decent sentence if you can write clearly

00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,249
there's 200 tickets that we could clear

00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:42,930
up more

00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:45,389
okay right so what else are we trying to

00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,830
do can we communicate better so this is

00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:49,080
an this is an area where there could be

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,580
contributions right fundraising the

00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,330
fundraising section of the Django

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:56,400
project comm site it's okay right but it

00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,919
could be really good there could be a

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,080
really good user experience there now

00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:02,189
that's not a little project but well

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,319
hang on I look around the room they're

00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:05,400
professionals that building good web

00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,349
experiences right

00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,620
perhaps a group of you could

00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:13,379
self-organized to come along and improve

00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,389
the fundraising section of the Django

00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:18,060
project comp site that might be a

00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:20,610
project the contributing guide its

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,990
massive it's like 6,000 words long it

00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,389
tells you everything you need to know to

00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:27,180
contribute to Django but I feel it might

00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:29,400
be a slight barrier to entry it might be

00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,740
overwhelming so can any of you self

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,419
organize to come and think you know we

00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,069
can reach this is how we could make the

00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:36,839
contributing guide more welcoming to new

00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:39,539
contributors this is what it's missing

00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:42,029
this is what people aren't seeing now of

00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:43,919
anybody any of you do want help doing

00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:45,779
that I'm here and Maris is there and

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,000
other people on the Django developers

00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:49,439
mailing list are there to help you along

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,060
but if you think yeah I could I could

00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,110
make that contributing guide more

00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:57,089
accessible super come along join us what

00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,830
about announcing the DSF better who

00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:01,259
didn't know there was a DSF for django

00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:05,460
Software Foundation who didn't know

00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:06,719
about fellows will Vincent was at Django

00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,250
Boston the other day and he's been

00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:09,899
nagging me he's like but nobody there

00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,129
knows about the dss nobody there knows

00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:13,680
about fellows these are people have been

00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:16,770
using Django for 10 years professionally

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:20,069
perhaps we can explain better about what

00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:24,029
we do as a community now again these

00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:25,349
aren't little projects right but with

00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:27,469
professionals that creating good web

00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:29,639
experiences maybe we could do this a

00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:32,610
thing I'd like to do better is to

00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,430
recognize contributions better so if you

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:37,979
contribute to get into Django you can

00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:40,770
you you get listed as a contributor but

00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:42,539
on github if you go to the committee the

00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,699
contributors tab it's like the Hall of

00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:46,979
Fame because it's you know top people

00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:49,800
they're 3,000 commits or something if

00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:50,790
you making your first PR and you get

00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,100
your first PR

00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:55,920
merged there's nowhere that you are

00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,360
celebrated for that contribution so what

00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,310
I quite like to do and this is still at

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,600
the discussion ideas fade is phase it's

00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,490
nation but it's gonna it's going to

00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,410
happen is we're going to make it so that

00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,360
per release or per month we're calling

00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,920
out the people who've contributed so the

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,190
people have contributed most the new

00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,660
contributors that you know to make make

00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:14,550
it a celebration of what we're doing

00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:21,390
here rather than well what I don't know

00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:22,590
who does who does joy right I mean added

00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,660
to that can we find other ways to

00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,740
celebrate all the other things that we

00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,360
do as a community that don't get

00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,160
celebrated there's much more to cut to

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,830
django than code and we don't i don't

00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,850
think we call it out well so again

00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:36,360
there's great opportunities to

00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:38,610
contribute here i'd like to put together

00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,430
a triage and review team these are

00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:43,350
people who give up their time to come

00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:46,020
and help Maris and I and they review

00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:47,430
pull requests they do triage and I'd

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,930
like to celebrate those people because

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,730
without them janga wouldn't really work

00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,260
now this ties in to what I talked about

00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:54,570
last year with the dissolving of Django

00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:57,420
core is that Django core was meant to be

00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:59,130
this this thing which celebrated people

00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,950
have contributed he got a bit stale it

00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:04,170
got gone away so there's a move to

00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:06,060
dissolve it and that's progressing these

00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:07,530
things go slowly but the triage and

00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,970
review team I want to set up and give

00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:11,400
that a trial and I don't want it to be

00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:13,710
like Django Corrigan so what one thing I

00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,690
want to do is it refreshed every release

00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:17,130
so you know if you do you want to still

00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:19,140
be on this team and still want to be

00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:21,510
actively if you're not step down but

00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:23,160
also just have it look X contributions

00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:26,820
and you're invited so it's not like some

00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,500
cabal of how do I get in there right now

00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,970
I'm this is just a trial gonna set it up

00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,150
but hopefully it'll be more accessible

00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:34,680
if you'd like to review PRS if you'll go

00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,240
back to those documentation tickets I'll

00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,190
talk about you want to get involved on

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,599
helping with the documentation on PL

00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:43,310
gets tall you could be in the triage and

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:46,200
rebooting okay

00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:47,400
right and then the other opportunities

00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,630
are beyond Django itself

00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,760
there's the supporting sites that are

00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,710
under the Django organization Django

00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,430
people Django snippets Django packages

00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:58,860
all of those need masses of love right

00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:01,050
but again we're web professionals surely

00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,649
we can make them good if we have time

00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,850
and bandwidth okay then

00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:05,779
there's the third-party apps that how

00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,369
many I'm talking about right there's

00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:09,019

00:09:07,369 --> 00:09:10,939
