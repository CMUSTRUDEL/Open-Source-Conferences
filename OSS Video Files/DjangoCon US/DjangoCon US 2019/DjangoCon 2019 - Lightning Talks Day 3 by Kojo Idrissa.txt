[Music]

00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:17,350
you

00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:17,350
[Music]

00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:21,929
all right so I wanted to talk about Geo

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,539
Jango and a little trick that I found to

00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:27,239
get it to work with Zappa which is a way

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:30,859
to run code on a WS lambda kind of Anna

00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:33,930
serverless quote buzzword II thing II

00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:36,500
can't really talk too specifically about

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,030
Geo Django or Zappa because of the time

00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,519
but if you've used it and you've been

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,610
waiting for this I finally found a

00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:47,519
comment after repo lling every couple of

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,500
months and somebody said hey there's

00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:50,939
this way and so I wanted to spell that

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,400
out and kind of put a bow on it

00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:55,710
so if you add raster i/o which is a

00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,759
geographic library for dealing with

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,640
raster or kind of traditional image data

00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:04,140
to your requirements file and then this

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,920
version is important if you want the

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,500
paths that I specify to to work go into

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,079
your settings file and specify your

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,320
Google or geospatial data abstraction

00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:20,759
library and geo s-- or geometry engine

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,430
open source libraries as these update to

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,820
Zappa function you will begin to be able

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:30,090
to do geo django queries as long as you

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:33,659
have a spatial database post GIS is best

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,330
and you can get that on RDS with their

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,350
postgrads version as well spatial light

00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,909
would work

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:43,500
just don't do spatial light because

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:45,240
that's an s3 database back-end now in a

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,920
real world you would not want to do this

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,909
because it won't run on docker or

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,619
locally so use environment variables

00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:54,960
there's a downside to this approach that

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:56,430
is great for hacking projects not so

00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,439
great if you're trying to port your app

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:03,390
it does cost about 20 megabytes over if

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,689
you manually manage your dependencies

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,819
which I'll post some info on later but

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:10,439
you have to basically the short blur

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:14,069
version is intercept the code package

00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:16,409
via zappa package or by just copying the

00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:17,819
file before it gets uploaded extract all

00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:21,450
the data and then pull them into your

00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:23,670
own repository and upload them now if

00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,029
you use slim Handler to get around that

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:29,969
limitation there's a 75 megabyte

00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:31,319
restriction for zappa then your paths

00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:34,439
will change it will be a

00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:37,049
Tim instead of invar tasks and it will

00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:40,040
also be based on your your project name

00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:42,870
still in the raster i/o not libs folder

00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,209
if you are unable to find them where you

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:48,090
change versions of libraries go back to

00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:51,239
the github issue and use this app invoke

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:55,980
command that they specify was that my

00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:57,989
time okay okay so we had a few extra

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,599
seconds because the adrenaline got me

00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:03,480
talking fast and so we'll talk about geo

00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:06,239
Jango if you want to use geo Jango you

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,629
can do things like sorry for the small

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,060
text like line 11 would take all objects

00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:14,159
in the database and annotate a distance

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,159
on to it so that I can see how far they

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:21,299
are from the point I specified and then

00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:24,299
we order by the distance and then we're

00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:26,730
able to display geospatial data this is

00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:29,159
really cool for finding where things in

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:31,500
your data are close to other things you

00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:33,709
know searching for stores or locations

00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,209
or any of these sorts of things are all

00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:38,040
really useful and then I guess we've got

00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:40,169
a little bit of extra time so we'll talk

00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,540
about Zappa there's a bunch of django

00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:44,489
con talks that are really useful on that

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,979
that you can find on the django con

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:49,259
youtube channel which will have posts

00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:52,769
from all of the talks from this year

00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:54,680
including closed captioning when and

00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:57,239
within a couple of weeks and so

00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,400
serverless still require servers it's a

00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,129
compatibility layer so that you can run

00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:06,449
on server lists with lambda but not have

00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:08,340
all the lock-in and most applications

00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:10,290
can run inside the free limit which is

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:14,040
kind of cool for hacking projects and

00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:16,919
learning stuff you can pip install Zappa

00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,019
Zappa NIT Zappa deploy take that URL

00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:22,370
drop it in allowed hosts Zappa update

00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,370
and then you're done Thanks

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,750
all right so we're gonna get started

00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:35,190
with jingle and exoplanets Marshall are

00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:36,960
you ready yeah please begin so this is

00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,610
me Marshall said my work at NASA's

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,160
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt

00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:43,460
Maryland everybody wants to know we do

00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,460
it NASA

00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:50,100
there we go so a little bit about me

00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:52,380
software engineer I'm very new to Django

00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:57,110
I was working on some earth science

00:04:52,380 --> 00:05:02,190
applications and this laser validation

00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:03,900
GUI set up there that job ended my boss

00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:06,120
came up to me and said hey do you want

00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,430
to work on this other project that

00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,590
involves Django and web programming and

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,850
I was like sure just sending me to

00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,850
Django Khan and I'll do it

00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,780
so that new project is called the

00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,990
exoplanet modeling and analysis Center

00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:24,380
it's a website it runs on Django and

00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:27,600
it's a clearinghouse for different

00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:30,840
scientists to showcase their work and to

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,930
present models and they're some of the

00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,880
case some of them are interactive my

00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:39,300
coworker who is here somewhere apeksha

00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:44,400
Patel actually worked on the CSS for

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:46,830
this it's a pretty basic website we've

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,740
got forms you put in some of the

00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,310
characteristics of your exoplanet how

00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,080
big is it

00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:55,800
sorry that's a little small I can't even

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,130
read that your size in terms of Earth

00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,130
radii

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:14,479
the chemical composition and our job is

00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:17,090
to be format agnostic so whatever model

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,009
the scientist comes and brings it to us

00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:21,199
it's our jobs integrated into the

00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:24,919
website so sometimes they come at least

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:30,350
perform on C++ or training or whatever

00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:35,720
the scientists like to use my job is to

00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:37,699
make these points what is an exoplanet

00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:45,199
an exoplanet is a planet it's work

00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:49,550
beneath another star you can see this

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:52,849
will light so the naked eye telescope so

00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:55,310
we use these flankers as the planet goes

00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:58,160
in front of the Sun did was light a

00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,810
little bit and so we look at the star on

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,280
enough and hard enough and see these

00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:06,380
patterns works well for very big stars

00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:10,510
and stars than were made closely to the

00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,510
Sun the first

00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,979
Witter Sciences adjusted in the LSAT one

00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:20,729
who look at the spectra in these next

00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:22,830
row exoplanets this is no way to find on

00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:26,160
the bottom that goes from ultraviolet to

00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:30,889
infrared there's a hole in there and

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:35,880
I've seen what kind of radiation from

00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:40,229
Mexico they planted with theoretically

00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:41,310
give off this radiation and they want to

00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:43,050
know if we tweak some of those

00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:46,949
parameters how is that going to change

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:50,220
the spectrum so that's the reverse what

00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:57,289
happens between the temperature of the

00:07:50,220 --> 00:08:01,229
planet by some NASA exoplanet missions

00:07:57,289 --> 00:08:04,110
this is the first one to Tess the

00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:13,580
transiting exoplanet survey it's got

00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:13,580
four cameras I keep moving my cursor

00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:24,680
four cameras and he just stares stars to

00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:24,680
be for those reasons

00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,780
so that's what's the internet some

00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:37,350
things now in the future on the right we

00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:40,230
have the James Webb Space Telescope that

00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:41,610
was built encounter it was actually

00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:43,560
something with the building you could go

00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:47,160
in and see if it built just kind of 18

00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:49,790
meter here as I mentioned beer that

00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,050
folds out and unfolds there's a

00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:55,620
sunshield the size of the tennis court

00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:58,740
is quite an impressive machinery

00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:01,940
check it out as you can it's supposed to

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,940
do much 20:21

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:22,190
the number of planets then we discovered

00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,190
doubles every 27 months

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,299
[Applause]

00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,990
[Music]

00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,529
[Music]

00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,490
[Music]

00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:14,480
[Music]

00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:27,469
[Music]

00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:38,100
[Music]

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,590
[Music]

00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,139
[Music]

00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,970
[Music]

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,830
[Music]

00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:19,580
[Applause]

00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,240
[Music]

00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,899
[Music]

00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:57,489
[Music]

00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,629
[Music]

00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:21,009
[Music]

00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:40,220
so

00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,220
[Music]

00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,519
[Music]

00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,669
[Music]

00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,359
[Music]

00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:21,100
[Music]

00:16:49,270 --> 00:17:13,660
so we then assess a to

00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:25,200
[Music]

00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:37,080
[Music]

00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:57,859
[Music]

00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:14,900
[Music]

00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,620
so

00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,160
[Music]

00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:37,749
[Music]

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,709
[Music]

00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:58,940
[Music]

00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,999
[Applause]

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,460
[Music]

00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:27,059
[Music]

00:20:32,580 --> 00:21:48,759
so I'm going to actually show some

00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:51,669
benefits of writing something by hand it

00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:53,739
can improve your memory like when it

00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:55,659
rains on it we seek help for me and I

00:21:53,739 --> 00:21:58,359
know it happens to you guys it actually

00:21:55,659 --> 00:22:00,820
helps me memorize fellow what I need to

00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:07,479
do so whenever I write down music any

00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:10,989
paper I feel that I need to do for me

00:22:07,479 --> 00:22:13,690
also our anniversary our greatest

00:22:10,989 --> 00:22:29,109
concerns organize the julu I will wear

00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:31,659
anything in or forgive myself that I

00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:33,729
won't be able to the dogs so it's just a

00:22:31,659 --> 00:22:37,479
nice way of getting rid of all that

00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:40,450
tomato brush that we get I would have so

00:22:37,479 --> 00:22:43,629
much to do it's crazy

00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:48,039
taking your time may be producing some

00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:50,649
calligraphy you can see that face much

00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:54,429
and some of those I don't really have to

00:22:50,649 --> 00:23:04,179
do so it's really nice it works for me

00:22:54,429 --> 00:23:14,780
and also you are not weighted your your

00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:19,010
mouse or keyboard you just write so

00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:21,770
listen you're in your bank you received

00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:24,530
these women from my coops as a completed

00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:26,990
work and he's just an example of how you

00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:28,970
can use the printer to earn the

00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:32,120
necessary so it's my planner for this

00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:34,280
week I took samples of some talks that I

00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:36,560
wanted to see some social events that we

00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:39,680
had this week and I will be correct for

00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:43,340
his methods and the circles and we are

00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:47,360
going to go sodium azide seen around the

00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:49,760
city so I hope you guys enjoy and

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:53,500
another good as use is whether or no

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,500
businesses and it helps us

00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:29,549
[Applause]

00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,940
[Applause]

00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:25,829
[Applause]

00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:31,160
anyway this is what I was then able to

00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:31,160
model

00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,559
[Applause]

00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,529

00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:39,309
[Music]

00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:39,309
so it should be finished

00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:44,579
[Music]

00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:17,089

00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:23,869
[Music]

00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,760
[Music]

00:35:42,609 --> 00:35:45,609
so

00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,419
[Music]

00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:10,949
[Music]

00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:29,040
[Music]

00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:49,460
[Applause]

00:36:50,220 --> 00:37:00,210
all right so the work I do involves

00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:01,860
making sure sites are accessible and one

00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:04,170
of the key things to make sure they are

00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:05,640
is to write good alternative text and

00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:08,490
that's what we're going to be talking

00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:12,180
about today so I'm going to do some

00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:14,910
concepts and we're going to be in three

00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:18,180
categories the first word is functional

00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:21,090
images this images might even be to the

00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:23,160
user that actually be initiated they are

00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:25,620
used to interactive elements like links

00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:28,670
or buttons and you can think of them as

00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:28,670
icons with badges

00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:34,320
permanent images these are images that

00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:36,840
graphically represent concepts and

00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,520
information those are probably the most

00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:41,610
difficult images you think about in our

00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:44,670
website that include pictures photos and

00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:46,710
illustrations and then lastly we have

00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:48,840
the courage of images they come to have

00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:51,210
additional preparation they do not

00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:53,400
convey any important information to the

00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:56,610
user and you can think of them as

00:37:53,400 --> 00:38:00,730
spectral images orders and other art

00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:04,150
these days they said designers like

00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:06,460
so let's go on a guy if you see how we

00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:10,930
can decide which kind of context we

00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:13,900
should enter in a fake some different

00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:15,340
communities so these are the three tiny

00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,860
principles are going to be really handy

00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:20,380
handy to make sure you write a good

00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:22,900
alternative text first of all you must

00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:25,690
focus on the strength of the function or

00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:27,870
the content of an image then it's very

00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:30,520
important that all images have a divine

00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:32,350
attribute even the answer may be stamped

00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:34,240
you do not want to have images it just

00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:38,680
don't have and not such a good at all

00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:40,840
we'll see that we'll see why next then

00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:43,660
remember the context is super important

00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:45,910
when describing images because in some

00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:52,180
context defining over the altar with

00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:54,880
empty is the best choice so you can

00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:56,500
start right when you encounter image you

00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,350
can start by making it faster this

00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:01,390
question is this image interaction then

00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:03,430
it is a functional image and you should

00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:05,830
describe the action for the result that

00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:07,570
the user is gonna is going to be

00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:10,120
expected when the interaction is this

00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:12,580
image so for example if I have this mark

00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:15,250
up I have a logo that is being wrapped

00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:18,850
on the anchor tag so this logo is going

00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:21,820
to take to the w3c oh babe so the

00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:24,760
alternative text is the w3c home because

00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:29,940
the user we're gonna win when they click

00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:32,099
the link then here we have a little

00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:34,890
image Spencer

00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:37,170
and instead of just answering printer

00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:40,769
icon used to say break the space because

00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:42,569
it's a entering the this front reaction

00:39:40,769 --> 00:39:45,719
that the user is going to perform or

00:39:42,569 --> 00:39:48,329
they think 11 o'clock now is if an image

00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:49,799
is not functional then you you go ahead

00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:52,499
and ask the second question does this

00:39:49,799 --> 00:39:54,329
image include console if if it's true

00:39:52,499 --> 00:39:56,459
then the Senate permit of image

00:39:54,329 --> 00:39:59,009
you must describe the minute and purpose

00:39:56,459 --> 00:40:01,619
of the image you should employ literal

00:39:59,009 --> 00:40:03,329
super obvious descriptions you don't

00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:05,009
need to start with picture or photo

00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:07,109
easier alternative text screen readers

00:40:05,009 --> 00:40:09,599
we're going to tell the user that this

00:40:07,109 --> 00:40:11,279
is a graphic and the surrounding context

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,079
sometimes it's not and you might not

00:40:11,279 --> 00:40:15,749
even need to provide the alternative

00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:18,029
text here so for example I have a

00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:19,499
paragraph here with two images the

00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:21,539
little five cups and then the actual

00:40:19,499 --> 00:40:23,609
value of the phone number or the fax and

00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:25,170
if you see the alternative text in the

00:40:23,609 --> 00:40:26,999
basis in different stations telephone

00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,529
and then kind of numbered so when this

00:40:26,999 --> 00:40:31,979
announced by scripture is going to see

00:40:28,529 --> 00:40:33,959
telephone 0 1 2 3 and then fax here 1 2

00:40:31,979 --> 00:40:37,859
3 and that's what for useful did you say

00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:40,229
you telephone icon or the fax line here

00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:44,569
we have for example of a little picture

00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:44,569
of the dog and we have the paragraph is

00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:54,570
talking about that Zeus father

00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:56,850
and here the image only conveys an

00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:58,620
emotion or a sentiment so the Senators

00:40:56,850 --> 00:41:01,560
apartment though this is a picture of

00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:03,240
faculty outside smiling we can say we're

00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:05,190
hardly friendly because the website

00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:08,790
trying to convey this information to the

00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:10,260
user and lastly if the image is not

00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:12,960
functional forest and doesn't have any

00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:14,790
content is decrypted who don't provide

00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,660
the political text we just leave the

00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:21,180
baggage even empty I was thinking for

00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:22,980
that if you don't provide the alt

00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,780
attribute at all this tribute is just

00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,130
gonna announce it wholly around and it's

00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:28,260
gonna be terrible experience for your

00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:31,590
sweetie during dessert you're gonna

00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:33,390
you're a sellout for them and when you

00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:34,740
leave the hall concert and empty the

00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:37,920
screen readers are going to see the

00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:39,570
image completely so this is assemble at

00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,830
the ordered image to just live in Mt

00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:44,040
and it's going to be skipped completely

00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:46,320
viable this is a good reader here which

00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:49,080
is quite redundant so we simply leave it

00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:53,340
out because the the text in the strong

00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:55,050
word is branded with the lien and here

00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:56,940
we have a description of the image so

00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:59,130
it's not really necessary in the
