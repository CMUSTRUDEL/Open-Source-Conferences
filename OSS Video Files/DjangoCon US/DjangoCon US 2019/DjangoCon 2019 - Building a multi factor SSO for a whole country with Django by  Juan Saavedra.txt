00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,210
thank you everybody for coming

00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:23,240
it's my first django come I'm pretty

00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:27,230
excited to be here got a wonderful band

00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,600
going on and the first thing to do is

00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:33,170
fix the title I don't know how many

00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:39,309
people know what an SS o is but that

00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:43,400
actually stands for a single sign-on so

00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:47,330
before proceeding just a quick heads-up

00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:50,720
we work we mark this I marked it out for

00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:55,960
everybody and it's true I think that

00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:58,250
every body regardless of level can take

00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:02,989
insightful things from from our

00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:06,619
experience but some bits might be a bit

00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:10,400
in death or a bit too security SHhhh so

00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:14,780
don't worry we'll hope that by the end

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:20,539
it all holds up and you can say I didn't

00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:23,859
lie so let's get started

00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:28,000
about me briefly a computer engineer I'm

00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:35,179
CTO and co-founder at octobot I'm a big

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:38,570
football soccer fan and I work enact

00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:40,969
about an hour talked about we design

00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:43,789
develop and deploy custom software

00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:47,299
solutions we use Django primarily for

00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:49,340
for our back-end development and we

00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:52,820
really enjoy transforming ideas into

00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:55,969
products people love so both the company

00:01:52,820 --> 00:02:01,100
and myself are from your way you are

00:01:55,969 --> 00:02:02,780
pretty you should feel free to do not

00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:06,259
know where your way is because it's a

00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:07,399
small very small country right down

00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:09,800
there

00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:14,540
it's about six thousand months of

00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:19,560
something up here hooray for planes

00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:23,040
and we are um what I'm here to present

00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:29,400
today it's a project that we undertook

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:32,940
for the Hawaiian government in which we

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:36,330
created a single account for all

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:40,200
services and that can be expanded into

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:42,900
other so I know some stuff about the US

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,080
and I'm guessing you have users for or

00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:49,470
credentials for IRS the MBE your health

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,510
provider banks and so on and all of

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:55,410
those have different levels of assurance

00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:57,810
of who you are you cannot create an

00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:01,950
account online if the bank does not know

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:04,230
who you are so what we did we created a

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:07,500
single sign-on for you our n government

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:13,050
in which you have one account that you

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:15,930
will use for either public services and

00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:19,290
also some other private services that

00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:23,280
need some form of assurance of who you

00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:26,610
are if they don't need that they can

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,440
also use your service so a bit of what

00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,630
we are going to talk about today I'm

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,920
going to give you a brief context about

00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:38,100
your ROI mainly because it's not that

00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,170
much popular about the challenge that we

00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,780
face and what was and what were the

00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:46,019
peculiarities of it the solution that

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:50,640
will apply that part will be the first

00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:53,040
part within about security mostly then

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,200
we'll take a pic a slight peek under the

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,540
hood and I'll present something that we

00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,690
did that we found interesting to share

00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:04,110
with you guys and some takeaways so

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:06,440
let's just start it away we are three

00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:09,810
and a half million people down there

00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:14,370
when you're under five you will you like

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:15,870
to count that half million people we

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,250
have a centralized government it's not a

00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:21,330
federal government a centralized

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:24,210
government around 70% of citizens there

00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:27,070
are Internet users I would say it's a

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:30,640
bit more but nonetheless that

00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:33,490
third-party assessment there are very

00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,490
good access to broadband and 4G

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,810
throughout the country there are no

00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,990
complex geography or something like that

00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:43,780
so it's pretty available and there's

00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:46,960
also a high availability of well of web

00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:49,450
capable devices so pretty much everybody

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,140
or can access either a cell phone that

00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:57,840
has well capabilities or small laptops

00:04:53,140 --> 00:05:01,660
or something like that okay

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,630
so digital you weigh all of that

00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:07,660
background actually place your eye on

00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:10,390
the road - for the last 10 years pushing

00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:12,460
through in becoming one of the that's a

00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:14,590
leading digital nations regarding a

00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:18,580
government it's right now one of the

00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:20,680
nine countries in the d9 countries it's

00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:25,300
a network of collaborative countries

00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:30,550
that push efforts to improve citizens

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:33,910
lives throughout technology we have a

00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:36,790
national ID card we have like forever

00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:40,230
had a national ID card and number each

00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:44,230
your wiring has a primary key let's say

00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:46,570
right now that card is electronic so it

00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:50,020
has some things that we'll see right now

00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:52,990
and there is is a government agency

00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:55,720
called a classic whenever I said this

00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:59,670
word Ocasek I'm actually saying those

00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,670
letters so follow me please

00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:08,260
Anna Cossack takes care of regulation

00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:10,720
and guidelines for laws and decrees and

00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:12,790
stuff like that and also execution and

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,210
orchestration of project through third

00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:19,450
parties they do not get involved

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,380
directly into projects executing that we

00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:23,410
would like to thank them for

00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,360
collaboration on this table so a bit

00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:28,270
about the the ID card and what

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,150
information is there there's like a

00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:35,830
sample ID card where you have last names

00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:37,750
first names rate of birth and that nein

00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,550
nein nein nein nein nein nein it's our

00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:43,139
primary key

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:46,970
and this card reveals some stuff about

00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:51,539
what the registration procedure is so

00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:53,039
that car actually because for you to

00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:54,180
take that card you have to give your

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,400
fingerprints

00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:00,780
you got fingerprint scan you got a

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:04,229
picture taken and and they give you this

00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:06,360
card that and you set up in you can

00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:09,659
actually set up in in on the car and you

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:13,530
can create digital signature so do we

00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:16,020
have a registration a high confidence on

00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:22,319
who that person is and the registration

00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:24,630
that's a standard procedure that was a

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,479
brief mention about that so the

00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:31,080
government as part of digital

00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:33,840
initiatives and so on establish goals so

00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,449
there are many of them but the three

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,150
that concern us for this talk today are

00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:41,550
well first they wanted to have a single

00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,500
point of contact a single digital point

00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:47,370
of contact for all the services its

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:51,240
provides to be available for every

00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:54,060
Seaton's is citizens to perform their

00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,330
procedures and operations digitally and

00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,830
remotely so they can from the house do

00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,990
whatever it's necessary with the

00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,060
government and also provide church

00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:11,130
services and assets for third parties

00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:13,680
such as a single sign now so what's the

00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:15,830
challenge here regarding the single

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:22,050
sign-on so the challenge is

00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:25,319
authentication why well because we must

00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:27,710
do assistance that can provide easy and

00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,819
secure easy secure and accessible

00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:32,909
authentication for all citizens

00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:37,169
you cannot leave users outside your

00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:40,169
system you have to support them all in

00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:42,630
fact people that might have the hardest

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:45,420
time using digital systems are probably

00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:48,060
the ones that can take most advantage of

00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:51,760
performing things remotely and from

00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:54,280
their houses we also want

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,290
to provide different integration

00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,570
protocols to reach out to as many

00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:01,090
organizations as possible

00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:05,080
this is a win-win scenario let's say if

00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:07,360
a lot of organizations are the citizens

00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:12,600
have a single sign-on to use on multiple

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:15,160
organization public and private if the

00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:19,810
if a lot of organizations use that

00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:21,780
system the the citizen will have the

00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:24,760
organization's will have a trustworthy

00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:26,950
source of information regarding who that

00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,510
user is and how it perform

00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:36,460
authentication to reach out to their

00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:40,000
systems so a lot of things went into the

00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:42,040
decision pipeline but at one point they

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,060
decided that they do not want it to go

00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:49,300
with an off-the-shelf solution that they

00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:51,730
wanted to build a single sign-on

00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:54,880
provider so what what should it provide

00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:57,490
so but this should what should this

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,800
solution provide so first it should

00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:02,320
provide multi-factor accessible single

00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:06,280
signal citizens should be able to

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:10,300
provide who they are in an accessible

00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:13,810
way and secure way use standard open

00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:16,720
protocol implementation so don't go

00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:19,810
around bending different stuff provide

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:24,360
some basic profile information name last

00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:26,680
name maybe an email will be nice and

00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:31,090
finally one of the things that triggered

00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:34,690
this custom-built is well you must do

00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:37,960
you must implement some way to to

00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:41,710
register on your system that yes this

00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:45,070
guy is who he says he is this user is

00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:48,220
who he says he is and also use custom

00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:50,620
authentication factors our ID cards are

00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,360
capable of doing digital signature I

00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,800
should be able to use my digital

00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,030
signature as a way of authenticating

00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:02,020
with the system so all that had to be

00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:04,030
custom made now how should it be those

00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,500
are like their requirements but how

00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:08,800
should it be order non

00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:13,690
functional requirements well it should

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:16,060
be reliable so it must be secure citizen

00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,620
must trust the system the company the

00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,470
organization that integrates with the

00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:23,410
system must trust the system to the

00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:27,880
scalable it should not have down times

00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:31,320
it should not suffer from unexpected and

00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:34,540
synchronize user usage for instance if

00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,800
tax deadline is coming up you don't want

00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:40,030
that ID system without the

00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:42,430
authentication system to go down it

00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:45,220
should be adaptable things change and

00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:47,710
this is in a lot of ways uncharted

00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,780
territory so it's pretty important to be

00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:51,520
make it a solution adaptable should be

00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:54,130
open the government should be able to

00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:58,270
see what's going on in that system and

00:11:54,130 --> 00:12:01,110
it should be accessible both in a maybe

00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:03,670
more classic disabilities way but also

00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:05,950
regarding devices so we want to out

00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:09,760
reach out to as many people as possible

00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:11,620
and that is and that implies providing

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,780
support for as many devices as possible

00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:18,100
so with all of this in mind the

00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:19,960
government said okay call for proposals

00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:24,160
who can do this

00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:28,470
so several providers went in and we said

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:31,360
we can totally build this with Chang so

00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:34,810
we worked with Django regularly and we

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:39,070
said we have never worked with the

00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:44,380
government before but this is something

00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:51,880
that we can do so yeah they say the same

00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:54,940
thing this these proposals have a an

00:12:51,880 --> 00:13:03,910
evaluation phase and so on not everybody

00:12:54,940 --> 00:13:05,350
was awesome board as other teams so the

00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,900
product owners were really thrilled to

00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:11,230
be working with Django and us but that

00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:13,360
was not maybe the perception across the

00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:16,970
organization particularly given that

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:21,110
this was a cornerstone project for them

00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:25,880
so the solution I'm by the way I'm here

00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:30,320
giving this talk so it went to write the

00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:31,970
solution there it is you can actually go

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,710
online if you have your passport and you

00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:37,610
know Spanish you can actually create

00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:40,280
your account if not you can go and

00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:43,250
become a citizen and you'll be fully

00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:49,940
enabled to access the solution it's

00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:52,700
really a web app and I'm not going to

00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:54,770
show it because people have recommended

00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,730
me not doing demo with conference Wi-Fi

00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:59,300
and so on

00:13:55,730 --> 00:14:02,870
but you can go there I hope we hope that

00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:06,490
you you see something that's worse so

00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:10,130
some numbers right now there are about

00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:13,970
350,000 citizens in the platform that's

00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:15,950
about 10% of our country so yay but

00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:18,680
about a third of them are certified

00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:21,620
account so you know when Twitter shows

00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:24,710
you the tick so those are certified

00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:27,290
accounts that have either gone in

00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:30,410
presence to send certain stations where

00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:33,130
they can certify themselves or use their

00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:36,050
digital ID card to perform verification

00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:40,520
and we have about those daily

00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:42,260
interactions so what's in the back it's

00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,750
not that complex products and I want to

00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:48,560
see these right now because we're going

00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:51,440
to do a bit of security and I want just

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:54,200
to say it's not that complex product

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,600
it's not the it's not a complex domain

00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:59,930
the reality is not that much complex

00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,970
models are not that much complex so

00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,560
there are two react apps one the one

00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,360
you'll see in that domain the other are

00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,670
before back office and certification

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,089
purposes and there is the Shango project

00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:13,700
serving all of this as notable mentions

00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:20,810
we have celery doing some stuff and of

00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:23,690
course Django rest framework should

00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:26,330
mention it's a must mention that library

00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:28,450
that basically provides you with an

00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:31,400
out-of-the-box open Ida connect provider

00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:33,950
by 25

00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:36,920
that's actually a crow is a neighbor

00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:38,240
from Argentina I believe so it's a great

00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,730
library you should check it out if you

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:46,820
ever face in your you're ever faced with

00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:49,910
this situation so security one of the

00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:52,460
important things about security is

00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:54,170
understanding threats and avoiding

00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:57,710
incidents particularly understanding

00:15:54,170 --> 00:16:00,650
threat so I'm guessing most of you are

00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:04,370
developers and not construction site

00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:06,530
workers if there are you might not be

00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:09,950
surprised what follows but for you

00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:11,990
developers you go around and you'll see

00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:15,020
the signs on a construction site and

00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:17,960
says wear a helmet wear work boots and

00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:20,420
for us it's pretty evident that you

00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:23,630
should do that say yeah of course why

00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:25,850
why wouldn't somebody wear a hat in a

00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:27,740
construction site things go off all the

00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,710
it's because you have to remind that

00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:32,930
because people that is there an everyday

00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:36,290
environment it's like normal for them

00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:43,640
like thanks for it doesn't happen to me

00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:45,200
it's okay no worries but there should be

00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,320
signs like this in software development

00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:51,860
companies now why aren't those there

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:54,770
because the risks are not that evident

00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:57,320
so you're faced with situations that are

00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:59,450
not that like yeah you know what that

00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,600
huge crane might fall and if I don't

00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:05,210
have my helmet on I'm surely dead this

00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:08,170
is like yeah I couldn't deploy that so I

00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:16,760
disabled this flag over here we're fine

00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:20,000
you're not so avoiding insecurities

00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:22,640
incident it's about understanding the

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,040
risks and also doing some stuff that

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:29,720
also construction sites do that is

00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:31,810
preparing or working in a safer

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,610
environment first its understanding so

00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:36,740
with it threat modeling first important

00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:40,550
thing threatening understand what you're

00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:43,640
facing regarding security second do

00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:47,780
security by design make your

00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:51,710
your product as secure as possible from

00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:55,720
the get-go do not mmm do things that

00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:59,990
might introduce problems in concrete

00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:02,630
perform useless privilege and security

00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:05,120
in in depth those are security

00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:06,290
principles and also finally that's

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,690
something that applies to construction

00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:10,700
site workers as well as someone no one

00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:13,070
else is checking your work you are the

00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,440
last line of defense

00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:17,120
in security this is for all developers

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,550
that were working on this project is

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,100
like you are the last line of defense

00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:24,590
it's security it's up to you eventually

00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:27,680
there will be checked by others we

00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:31,820
pentesting reviews security scanning sub

00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:36,740
so on but assume that can fail you are

00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:40,670
the last line of defense so I'm going to

00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:43,400
speak about fraud modeling briefly what

00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:48,710
we did from an exaggerated process to

00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:51,500
identify problems with possible points

00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:53,890
of vulnerability we find out that

00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,180
improves risk perception and

00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:59,570
vulnerability awareness so developers

00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:02,350
are much more aware of what the problems

00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:06,770
really are how called attacks work and

00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:08,690
were vulnerable it might pop up provides

00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:11,590
an in-depth understanding of the

00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:15,230
security settings that goes for Shango

00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:18,770
and the protocol so you can you can

00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:20,990
start to see why ok this token is sent

00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:23,540
over here and you can it's announced so

00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:25,670
it don't use it twice because you start

00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:29,360
to get a sense of why things are there

00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:33,770
and it has become a must do security

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:37,400
exercise for for software projects from

00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:40,790
from our experience there there are

00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:44,450
several techniques one is elevation of

00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:46,850
privilege it's a car game we think it's

00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,920
a fun approach to threat modeling it's

00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:51,950
based on a strive classification of

00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:56,780
vulnerabilities go check it out it's

00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:59,190
very good you need a bit of

00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,840
you need a bit of a security background

00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,550
but not that much and it's open access

00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,020
my Microsoft you can download it and

00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,490
print it and I think you can buy them as

00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,340
well

00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:09,000
so what security practices came out of

00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:13,530
this

00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,660
well first establish non-default

00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:18,300
restrictive global use non-default

00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:20,520
restrictive global settings so don't go

00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:23,040
with the defaults if you don't know

00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:25,170
where what they are make endpoint

00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:30,270
declarations explicit in axis when you

00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:33,150
declare an APR an endpoint be sure that

00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:35,670
you know who has access to use that

00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:38,130
operation this implies keeping

00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:39,890
permission granular and semantic you

00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,910
know when you write that permission

00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:44,460
being run and semantics

00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:46,920
don't go about reinventing the wheel so

00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,000
use a standard crypto usest and our

00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,910
protocols

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,650
do not repeat yourself you probably are

00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:56,400
introducing vulnerabilities if you are

00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:58,230
repeating code practice security in

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,450
depth right the deployment configuration

00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:03,270
know what's going to run and what the

00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:06,180
communication paths are in your back-end

00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:09,240
deployments perform extra checks even if

00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:12,270
it's in inner communication apply the

00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:15,050
list privilege principle you should

00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:17,730
provide only the necessary data and

00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:20,310
operations to a user to perform the

00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:22,020
necessary transfer transaction and last

00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:23,700
but not least don't forget a lot of a

00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:27,720
liability one of the most common attacks

00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:29,850
is denial of service and don't make an

00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:33,750
attackers life easier in five failure

00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:36,500
points and implement protections such as

00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:39,090
throttling or good scalability guide so

00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:41,850
these are the security practices that

00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:44,790
arise from threat modeling and security

00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:47,370
by design we'll go out and how they

00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:50,460
impacted specifically different aspects

00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:53,850
such as architecture we regularly use

00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:56,730
like always twelve factors go check it

00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:59,040
out feed on Odin I place this for

00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:02,640
because are the most important in our

00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:05,460
work for this project in this case it

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,270
allows us to evaluate good integrations

00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,190
avoid

00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:09,960
setup mismatches and other problems that

00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:17,200
might introduce security

00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:19,030
vulnerabilities regarding the API we

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,460
didn't use micro-services it's not a

00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:23,890
complex reality we will rest rest

00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:25,050
framework we did group the API by

00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:27,370
availability and scalability

00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:29,890
requirements so the authentication

00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:32,530
endpoints it's actually much more used

00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:34,060
that the management 8.4 authentication

00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:37,210
factors like change your password you

00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,810
don't do that off don't use the false

00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,100
aerolizer

00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:43,780
be explicit about the serialization

00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:47,590
you're using and actually be slim about

00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:49,170
those realizers well and you struggling

00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:55,000
we said that already

00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:56,800
regarding development we use git it's

00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,980
easier to handle if you have multiple

00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:04,330
environments like test station station

00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:06,580
to liberal and pro for our experience

00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:10,510
it's it's a better way to handle that

00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:12,610
without having a cold differences use we

00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:15,700
use a static code analysis at all levels

00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:17,830
front and back end at sim force at CI so

00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:20,680
we are looking at the cold as it goes

00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:22,420
into the repo we use docker dev

00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:26,530
environment there was a talk about this

00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:28,930
here so go check it out please go

00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,650
scripts as in not go the language but

00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,690
code scripts

00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:35,560
check it out there are pretty good made

00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:37,450
like my plant it about us CI a dev

00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:40,330
environment mismatches so we have this

00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:42,520
the CI and their team run exactly the

00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:44,500
same scripts and commands so that's

00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:47,590
pretty useful to avoid introducing

00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:50,110
vulnerabilities and we do peer reviews

00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:52,720
finally log smart log carefully log

00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:56,430
plenty will you have to be careful about

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:59,290
which data you're logging you have to be

00:23:56,430 --> 00:24:02,530
you have to log plenty of information

00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:05,910
because you want to be to have audit

00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:10,450
capabilities and perhaps detecting

00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:11,740
suspicious behavior but you have to look

00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:16,060
carefully because you don't want to let

00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:20,800
people's data in in an open accessible

00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:22,570
way so infrastructure brief mention this

00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,010
is run on open shift it's a Coronet

00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:26,830
based solution by

00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:28,450
it's run on a government cloud there is

00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,740
an operator's team for the production

00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:34,180
environment so we don't actually have

00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:36,550
access to that regarding the deployment

00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:40,900
guidelines but we did to actually

00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:43,540
address one problem that might arise or

00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:46,570
eliminate abilities up the deployment

00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:49,540
configuration being written by the dev

00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:52,540
team so we actually write the deployment

00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:55,450
template and we cannot generate the

00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:57,580
different deployment files combining the

00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:59,080
template that's given by us the

00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:02,770
parameters that given by business people

00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:06,120
and the secrets that's given by the

00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:08,680
operator so database passwords and so on

00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,420
it enables a formal communication

00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:15,820
between developer and operation

00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:19,300
developers and operators so briefly and

00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:22,030
because they cover minutes left I wanted

00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:23,830
to cover some of the under the some

00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:26,410
appeal of what's going on under the hood

00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:28,030
regarding one point particularly that is

00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:30,520
the stateless multi-factor

00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:33,490
authentication so no default

00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,980
authentication I'm hoping I'm guessing

00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:38,860
I'm hoping that everybody has used

00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:41,350
multi-factor authentication once but you

00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:44,860
actually have to provide not just a

00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:46,630
password a password a token one-time

00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:48,910
password that such as Google

00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:51,250
Authenticator something like that or in

00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:54,340
our case our users citizens have

00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:57,910
authentication factor and a login is the

00:25:54,340 --> 00:26:00,940
completion of all necessary factors for

00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:04,360
a given context so if you have been on a

00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:08,410
travel you know that if you log in with

00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:12,550
Google somewhere else Google is going to

00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:16,600
start asking for different stuff that

00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:18,340
can happen but what's important is that

00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,890
there is a variable factor list it's not

00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:24,610
always the same list and it depends on

00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:27,730
the user so a given user and one point

00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:32,530
Mike are just a password asks and in on

00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:34,300
a system but in another context it may

00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:37,059
have a different set of challenges

00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:38,980
require so

00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:41,470
how do you keep track of a stateful

00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:44,380
transaction in a stateless scaleable

00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:45,730
request environment so one thing is

00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,650
using sessions and keep tracking the

00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:50,620
session of what's going on with the user

00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:53,049
whenever the first request comes I'd set

00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:54,580
your session here you go and I'll start

00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:58,510
keeping track of that interaction in the

00:26:54,580 --> 00:27:01,780
session that goes to the DB the other

00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:05,799
alternative is using st. Olga's so sign

00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:08,110
tokens will enable us to actually keep

00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:11,200
track of what's going on by sharing a

00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:14,650
token with the user on each request we

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,830
will see that how that works right now

00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:19,360
so it's a challenge based authentication

00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:22,150
the user

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:25,120
I hope the that size is readable from

00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:29,409
from the back the user will say ok I'm

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:32,200
trying to log in here is the my reply

00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:34,630
for the username challenge there were

00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,870
candles say okay what are the list of

00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:41,230
your authentication factors so say ok

00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:43,570
you need to send in the password so we

00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:45,580
can send me what's the next request for

00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:46,840
me to handle and also will send me a

00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,909
token saying

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:53,549
relevant stuff in this case what says

00:27:48,909 --> 00:27:59,230
it's that I have personal challenges yet

00:27:53,549 --> 00:28:03,070
so I got my token next step I'll send

00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:04,960
you my password I have I'll send you

00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:06,280
what's the challenge I'm replying to its

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,130
password what's my password

00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:12,600
that's not my password and also what's

00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:15,490
the token that you sent me before so

00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:17,500
that token is sign so they can actually

00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:24,220
the backend can actually know hey I got

00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:26,289
this guy yeah you need now totp so but

00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:30,850
you have now pass the password charge

00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:36,760
and that token is also sign so the next

00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:38,350
one is okay here is my totp my token the

00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,940
left token yourself that's already

00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:42,309
passed chatter so the back end now says

00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:45,610
ok because we discussed skype has passed

00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:47,500
qtp and password challenges you're good

00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:50,420
to go and that with that goal I can

00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:54,230
follow up on open ID connect

00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:56,830
authentication strategy so the benefits

00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:59,150
of this we avoid the database until

00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:01,490
necessary so we'll provide a session

00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:05,210
once the user has fulfilled all

00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:07,490
necessary challenges this also helps us

00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:09,230
avoid heavy queries because when we have

00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:11,900
to retrieve maybe profile that and so on

00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:14,440
it's a bit heavier and there's no

00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:17,660
affinity it really doesn't matter which

00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:23,620
back-end instance running handles my

00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:23,620
request to wrap up briefly in one minute

00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:29,630
takeaways well first I don't know if you

00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:31,370
have had to sell Django recently but if

00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:33,260
you go on the side it will say things

00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:34,730
like Django is reassuring with

00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:37,370
ridiculously fast

00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:41,540
fully loaded reassuringly secure and

00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:43,130
well it is we know that but for instance

00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:45,710
people in the government did not know

00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:48,950
now did not know that and they have

00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:51,080
gotten to know it business people love

00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:53,060
their ability that the solutions have

00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:56,180
and that is in great part because of

00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:58,310
Django button technology and operators

00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:00,890
love availability and scalability we are

00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:06,020
from their world where the best behaved

00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:08,030
citizen of their cluster finally jungle

00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:10,370
security is reassuring Django is real

00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:13,010
secure we have been already and stuff

00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:16,040
like that but it's important to know why

00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:17,930
try elevation of privilege it will help

00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:21,260
you do some thread Molony understand

00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:24,080
security settings avoid assembling

00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:26,420
checks of course set not default the

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:29,270
global configuration so if you're going

00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:31,750
with the defaults at least look at them

00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:35,750
or copy and paste them on your settings

00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:36,920
make your colon annotation explicit be

00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,750
semantic be clear

00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:41,330
somebody's going after you to look at

00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:43,670
the call it has to know from the from

00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:47,210
from the description and what's there

00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:49,600
who has access to that and work on

00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,600
availability

00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:06,620
were you using salary for because we the

00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:09,570
tasks for instance we have to retrieve

00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:11,010
certificates that have been revoked for

00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:13,350
because if you get your national ID

00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:16,500
stolen you go to a police department say

00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:18,960
I've been stolen and they'll cancel that

00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,630
idea so we have to regularly retrieve

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:27,030
that list and perform some updates for

00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:34,950
instance that's great thank a was the

00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:37,950
bottleneck well there's we really

00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:40,010
anticipated more than maybe that's

00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:42,420
actually they're actually scalability

00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:46,230
scalability has been working right so

00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:48,390
far and even with things such as the our

00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:50,460
local IRS saying from one day to another

00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:53,040
here you have one week to fulfill this

00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:54,750
and you have to do you have to use this

00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:57,570
authentication factor so everybody was

00:31:54,750 --> 00:32:02,160
like on a couple of hours traffic jump

00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:05,100
10-4 and no calls no anything so that's

00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:08,760
great that's in great part because of 12

00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:10,620
factors we really think that it's a it's

00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,270
a great path to to scalability it's

00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,520
about it's a lots of pain points there

00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:15,410
yes thank you for that talk it was

00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,300
excellent

00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:19,250
given how mission-critical they're so

00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:23,460
sames

00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:26,790
how many automated tests did you write

00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,300
around this and and and if any I'm sure

00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:32,940
he did

00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:35,520
what type of tests so there are there

00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:39,960
was a testing bit on this that is true

00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:42,450
on the plane over here but we used the

00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:47,040
default that everything is unit tested

00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:50,100
we use the default Django test

00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:53,460
that jungle test framework for react we

00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:55,980
use just great talk how do you handle

00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:57,720
production support sorry how do you

00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:01,559
handle production support since you guys

00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:03,660
have we are not operators so there the

00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:08,059
it's actually handled there is we are

00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:12,660
the third line so the first line is the

00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:16,799
government they have this a system

00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:19,049
support then there's the specific our

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:23,090
product owners support and there there's

00:33:19,049 --> 00:33:25,980
us so we can do nine to five let's say

00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:26,360
there are no special needs regarding

00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:30,630
that

00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:33,660
great talk thank you so you mentioned

00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:38,010
that 10% of the population is using the

00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:40,020
service and just above 70% of the

00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:44,340
population is connected to the Internet

00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:46,620
so that's about 14% I was wondering if

00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:52,230
you envision that number increasing over

00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:56,630
time yes and if so how and like how can

00:33:52,230 --> 00:34:00,600
you drive that level of adoption okay

00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:03,090
disclosure yes that number I forgot to

00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:08,310
mention it greeting it's risen it's been

00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:10,379
increasing steadily besides IRS southern

00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:13,320
requests and so on it's been increasing

00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:15,090
steadily from the fact that new

00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,700
organizations and new procedures and

00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:19,409
jumping into the the platforms or new

00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,030
use for instance if you want to travel

00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:23,609
to Brazil you need to get to get the

00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:26,820
yellow fever vaccination and to get kill

00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:31,290
off to get that vaccine you need to get

00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:34,020
a number where they require to so every

00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:35,609
holiday season with rapid and we needs

00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:38,100
increase and it keeps increasing and it

00:34:35,609 --> 00:34:42,510
increases coverage we don't actually

00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:44,250
have a saying or an interest besides the

00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:47,040
marvelous things that you can do

00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:52,980
regarding user increase we are not

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:55,740
driving commercially you know but this

00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:57,450
seems like a very critical system where

00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:59,490
you guys involved in some penetration

00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:59,940
testing or some third-party evaluation

00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:03,240
of

00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:08,220
yeah actually

00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:09,720
Isaac higher we did the work but they

00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:11,640
called texting teams they had

00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:15,750
penetration testing team we had security

00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:18,119
audits team in production systems are

00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:20,099
running that doing other checks for

00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:22,530
instance in traffic and so on I'm not

00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:24,089
going to say a lot about that yeah they

00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:25,440
did penetration testing from third

00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:28,410
parties yeah

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,990
thanks for the talk do you see yourself

00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:33,839
working on other projects at the

00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:36,150
government or country level yes actually

00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,069
we are right now working on the let's

00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:40,289
say next step it's not actually the next

00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:45,180
step I just associate the project that's

00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:48,180
regarding authorization so you you will

00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:50,400
be able to provide observation to

00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,680
organizations or public and private

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,200
access to your personal data for

00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:58,980
instance you go to health institution

00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:01,920
and a different one and they'll ask your

00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:04,380
previous health provider to access your

00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,690
health records so you will be able to

00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:09,089
provide on the authorization platform

00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:11,700
consent for that it's very tightly

00:36:09,089 --> 00:36:15,029
related is the depth or accession part

00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:18,660
this is the authentication part it's in

00:36:15,029 --> 00:36:25,140
that country this has any point for

00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:27,420
different level the open data like some

00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:30,180
data is accessible by Garmin and other

00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:31,920
like companies and some of us use some

00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:34,799
of the data only wish to restrict to

00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,960
yourself it could not understand your

00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:39,119
question colleges it's a nice common

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,339
point is that for the the data has

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:46,079
different level the different level open

00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:49,319
data for the different parties so there

00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,750
is open data initiative back home it

00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:54,900
does not work there is also a privacy

00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:59,789
protection enforcement so that's not

00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:01,559
actually combined the true and I don't

00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:03,839
know if that answers your question

00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:08,150
I'm nervous we can discuss it later in

00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:08,150
the whole wave if you thank you

00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,740
okay thank you

00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:19,550
thank you

00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:32,849
[Applause]
