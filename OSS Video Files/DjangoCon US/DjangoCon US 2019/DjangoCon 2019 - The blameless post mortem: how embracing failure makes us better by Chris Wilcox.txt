	DjangoCon 2019 - The blameless post mortem: how embracing failure makes us better by Chris Wilcox

In todayâ€™s world of developing services we tend to move fast and with that comes mistakes. This talk will discuss using post-mortems to turn incidents into opportunities for improvement, instead of just an opportunity to assign blame.

This talk was presented at: https://2019.djangocon.us/talks/the-blameless-post-mortem-how-embracing/

00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:19,099
so I don't start off on sort of a

00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,279
positive note since most of this talking

00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:24,710
at pretty negative software's pretty

00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:27,680
incredible in the 20 years that I've

00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:30,170
worked with technology I think it's safe

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,760
to say that it's evolved we've come a

00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,449
long way from where everyone started in

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,519
the 1990s when I was originally starting

00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:39,890
my journey into using a computer the

00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:41,480
internet was a small thing I would have

00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:45,500
never imagined the sort of speeds we

00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,839
could get now or the size of it we've

00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,540
also come from a place where websites

00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:54,620
have come from a place where they were a

00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:56,390
very simple small site single purpose to

00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,940
having multiple services interlinked

00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,339
with complicated off complicated

00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:05,059
security problems multi-regional

00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:06,710
deployments and many more things and it

00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:09,979
turns out when your software gets more

00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:11,299
amazing so do your bugs that's part of

00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:13,610
the evolution we don't get to have one

00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:15,350
without the other so it's reasonable

00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,280
expect as we continue our failure modes

00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,240
are gonna keep evolving

00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,270
they're gonna keep getting more

00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:24,909
complicated and harder to deal with and

00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:29,229
we're going to fail so I was thinking

00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:31,340
what if we saw this is an opportunity

00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:32,840
what if instead of seeing this as a

00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,189
reason to run away from computers and

00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,179
say this is all a big mistake we should

00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:36,740
have all just been gardeners and

00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:38,719
janitors and never talked about these

00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,939
computers maybe we could learn from

00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,039
these bugs maybe we could take these

00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:46,189
negative experiences and use them for

00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:49,520
positive gain this is what post-mortems

00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:51,619
give us they give us a way to learn to

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,560
grow as a team to deliver more things

00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:57,859
for our customers to be more successful

00:01:53,560 --> 00:02:00,439
we can do this through failure but

00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:02,780
there's an interesting thing this only

00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:06,200
works if everyone on your team feels

00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:08,030
safe to fail it only works if they feel

00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,520
open to share when they make a mistake

00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:13,540
so we can all learn from it and then we

00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,280
can prepare better for future failures

00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,660
so before I get too far into the talk I

00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,819
just kind of wanted to take a second to

00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,440
talk about myself I spent most of my

00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:24,049
time in my career working for large

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,920
companies I started working on dotnet

00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:26,630
websites

00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,520
but then I moved on to working on IDs

00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:31,550
and compilers cloud services and

00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:33,260
building cloud platforms today I spend

00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,990
most of my time working on the client

00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:38,090
libraries for Google cloud for seven

00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:43,970
different languages - being one of my

00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:46,670
personal focuses I think it's

00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:50,390
interesting to reflect on why we call it

00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:52,940
a bug we have these these failures in

00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,590
our code these problems but we didn't

00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,360
just choose the word bug the issue is at

00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,250
a certain point in time they were

00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,100
literal bugs we could see them we could

00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,959
spot them they cause problems in relays

00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:06,530
and as far as I know this is the first

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,430
computer science post-mortem this is an

00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,560
example of a moss

00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,410
taped to a sheet of paper describing a

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,800
time stamp what went wrong and what the

00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:17,900
problem was I kind of wish it was this

00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,459
easy to show the problems that our

00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,760
software systems have I've never been

00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:26,060
able to tape it to a sheet of paper but

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,530
here it is so our systems have evolved

00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:30,170
the the failures have gotten harder but

00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,269
we still do the same processes the

00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:34,310
problem now is they aren't moths they're

00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:36,290
cosmic rays service interruptions

00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,860
complicated failure between your two

00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:41,269
micro service and some officers to use

00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,500
so maybe it's not going to be single

00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:45,350
pointed but we can still use this

00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,739
process I also think what's interesting

00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:50,989
there's nowhere on this as there blame I

00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:54,560
mean we don't blame them off for falling

00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:55,910
into the relay it happened we can set up

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,700
things to the moth can't get and the

00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,840
relay again but blaming something isn't

00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:04,250
going to move us forward it's not gonna

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,780
prevent future failure so we can look at

00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,870
our own past but we can also look at

00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,160
other industries there are a few other

00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:13,100
industries that I want to talk about

00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:16,250
that find ways to handle these complex

00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,840
scenarios in their environment and I

00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,959
think we can use these to look back at

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,620
software and for the industries I'm

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,740
going to pick VB will some pretty

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,120
serious subjects I think at one point or

00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,070
another everyone says the phrase yeah

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,720
it's life or death but for a lot of

00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,099
industries that's true that's what they

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,349
deal with day in and day out they deal

00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:38,720
with people's lives and the outcomes of

00:04:36,349 --> 00:04:44,000
their situations directly effect

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:46,130
that but they all have the same thing in

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,320
common that I think Tec does and that we

00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:50,690
can learn from our mistakes and we can

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,030
improve our systems and if we can find

00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,920
ways to shift from blame to invest

00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,620
saving systems the reasons things go

00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:00,950
wrong and put in place Prevention's we

00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,990
can grow the thing is a lot of cultures

00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:05,330
and organizations are gonna focus on

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,710
blaming individuals I would say the

00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:09,320
culture we exist on outside of tech

00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,450
defaults as to this we want to look at

00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,670
someone and say it it's their fault they

00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:16,160
did it but if you really reflect on that

00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:17,270
that didn't solve your problem and at

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,380
least for me personally it doesn't

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,600
really make me feel better

00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,280
it makes someone else feel worse it

00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,560
doesn't move you forward so why are we

00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,110
doing it at all so let's look at some

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,860
other industries I want to start by

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:33,320
talking about the NTSB the NTSB is a

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,780
u.s. organization that monitors rails

00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:39,320
highways aviation pipelines and

00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:43,210
hazardous material transportation they

00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:47,030
exist to investigate incidents accidents

00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:50,810
failure modes during transportation that

00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:53,540
affect people like I said a lot of their

00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:55,910
failures are pretty serious all right

00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:59,510
I'm airplanes when they crash I have

00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:01,040
some pretty disastrous outcomes so

00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:05,240
there's there's an interesting aspect to

00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,740
the NTSB they aren't prosecutors they

00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,680
cannot use the evidence collected in

00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:13,010
their investigation to blame someone or

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,780
hold them legally accountable they can

00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,270
prevent this in the future they can take

00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,040
actions change processes change

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:23,330
regulations but they cannot use this

00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,950
incident to hold you at fault we have

00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:27,320
other organizations so in the u.s. we

00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:29,570
have the FAA we have the FBI they're

00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,060
going to handle that part but the NTSB

00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:35,120
is solely concerned with how do we avoid

00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:37,700
this this terrible thing happened how do

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:42,860
we not do it again and that environment

00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:44,600
blame has no place so as I said they've

00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,640
provided a lot of safety recommendations

00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:50,380
through this about 13,000 them to date

00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,600
and they do this with a few techniques

00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,610
with

00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,190
blame people are open to share their

00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:58,830
faults and then we see from people's

00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:02,460
mistakes even if they're inside the

00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:03,150
process that's the faults right that's

00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,590
what caused it

00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,790
there was something that went wrong and

00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,330
we'll talk about an example from the

00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:11,760
NTSB in a bit but if you blame them

00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:13,200
they're not going to share that they're

00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,940
gonna sit quietly in the corner and wait

00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,560
for someone else to say anything at all

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,540
they can maybe explain this other than

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,100
what they did but an environment without

00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,270
blame people share openly and you can

00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,190
move forward and you can start to figure

00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:25,230
out how a lot of times incidents aren't

00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,400
single pointed at all there's a few

00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,320
things that have to work together and we

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,550
have no hope of learning from that and

00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:34,470
preventing in the future unless we

00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:37,590
understand all of those aspects so

00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:40,560
here's an NTSB report they start fairly

00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:42,960
boring I would say this to me wreck is

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,940
very recognizable with design documents

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,400
that I've used in engineering it

00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,740
describes a very factual situation

00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,540
something happens in this case they say

00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,340
it was an accident says that there are

00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,110
injuries in this case there weren't any

00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,420
injuries and they say what did it cost

00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:01,530
ultimately what was the cost of this

00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:02,940
event so you don't really gather too

00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:05,070
much from this to get some weather and

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,870
then they tend to include things like

00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:08,610
pictures and for me this makes this very

00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,250
very easy ok so there's an accident

00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:13,260
there's a collision that boat appears to

00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:16,530
have a hole in it that's probably the

00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:20,910
problem right so how did we get here how

00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:22,230
did we get to this this place in this

00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,150
particular accident

00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:25,410
they found that certain processes

00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,360
weren't followed but they also found

00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:29,370
that the process that exists didn't

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,110
necessarily cover the situation they

00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,760
were in and so the flexibilities in the

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,560
existing processes and recommendations

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,669
allowed people to have this failure

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,260
happen so at the end of the report is

00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:42,539
where these recommendations come in in

00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,370
this case one of the things that wasn't

00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:46,590
happening was there was no one on

00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:50,070
Lookout on a ship now it turns out if

00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:51,630
you have two vehicles on an open plane

00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,220
and eventually they're going to

00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,240
intersect if no one does anything to

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,830
stop that

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,920
and so these boats ran into each other

00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,120
and they're very lucky that no one is

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,089
injured but they treated it with the

00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,040
same seriousness if someone was and from

00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:05,580
this we're able to devise new situations

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,020
for how you out

00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:11,130
communicate and how you ought to look

00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:12,360
out I think this is probably the most

00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:15,780
important thing that we can learn from

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,120
the NTSB there are plenty of

00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,230
post-mortems I have seen where we go

00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,940
through the work to find out what went

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,700
wrong but we often don't think about

00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,620
preventive measures this is likely the

00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,990
most important thing the rest of it that

00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:33,450
describes what happened it's informative

00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:36,380
but it's not actionable the other

00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:40,620
industry I wanted to talk about was M&M

00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:42,570
conferences so mmm doesn't literally

00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,340
mean the Mars and Marie's candies that

00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:47,460
we've all probably an entirely too many

00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:49,860
of I mean morbidity and mortality so

00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:52,710
it's a slight bit more serious so the

00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,730
healthcare industry remember I said the

00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,450
beginning some of these people deal with

00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,170
life and death

00:09:54,450 --> 00:10:00,390
quite literally so the thing about

00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:02,690
morbidity and mortality conferences is

00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,920
they have very similar goals to the NTSB

00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,660
the words change a little bit they care

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,880
about patient outcomes they care about

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,880
educating practitioners so they can do a

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,190
better job with patient care but this

00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,410
almost always is used not for your sort

00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:19,470
of routine failures but your more

00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:21,600
complex ones where possibly multiple

00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,310
physicians or facilities or

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,630
organizations that are involved when

00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,550
things start to get more complicated and

00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:32,120
you can't simply describe it as a very

00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:35,280
single point so the photo on my slide I

00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:39,090
don't know about all y'all out there but

00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:41,700
this looks pretty adversarial to me this

00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:45,000
is this is from a television show from

00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,230
the perspective of the presenter and if

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,820
people are looking at me like that I'm

00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,830
I'm not gonna be very open to share I

00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,270
I'm not I'm gonna feel uncomfortable

00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,380
sharing my faults that's for sure I'm

00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,330
not about to tell you I did anything

00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,740
wrong because I think you're waiting for

00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:59,370
that that's that's what you're looking

00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:02,250
for it is a dramatic portrayal it's from

00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:04,110
a television show and at a certain point

00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,640
in time this is what M&M conferences

00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,410
looked like looked like senior

00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,380
physicians hospital management sitting

00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:12,450
with you and telling telling you you

00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,370
know to profess everything you've ever

00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,390
done wrong so that way they can put the

00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,120
fault on you and it wasn't the

00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:19,230
hospital's fault and that's it but we

00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,610
don't learn from that and

00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:25,530
people don't share in that they they

00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:27,510
tend to they tend to get quiet I'm

00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:29,900
hoping that it wouldn't surprise anyone

00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:33,120
that this isn't common practice anymore

00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:35,220
the medicine industry learned that that

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,050
dramatic portrayal which was more common

00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,140
wasn't producing the sort of result they

00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:43,080
wanted they were hoping to educate

00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:45,540
people they're hoping to inform

00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,280
physicians organizations hospitals and

00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,470
better ways to practice medicine that

00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,970
result in better outcomes you weren't

00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,470
going to get that with an adversarial

00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:57,650
panel but you might get that with a

00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:57,650
lecture hall so they changed the setting

00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:03,260
you have now taken a situation that I

00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:07,350
think you would say was full of animus

00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:09,510
and you've replaced with curiosity this

00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:11,340
simple change of setting was the exact

00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:15,750
same thing can change everything about

00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:17,850
how people view this there's another

00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,770
thing I thought was interesting when

00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,970
reading about I'm announced is they have

00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:22,860
a lot of conversations about who should

00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:26,880
be present and who should be able to

00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:28,080
talk when present this this related very

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,300
much to me in tech I've had similar

00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,640
conversations about this usually this

00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,440
takes the turn of should management be

00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,330
in the room should people who are not

00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,960
ICS we're not developers be in the room

00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:41,430
for a post-mortem because whether we

00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,050
like it or not there's a power dynamic

00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,540
there and so if you're managers in the

00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:48,720
room you might feel less open to admit

00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:51,630
you've done something wrong and it turns

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,340
out within within medicine they're

00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:55,920
basically in split on the two so the

00:12:53,340 --> 00:13:00,000
stat I read from the the NCBI

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,470
the NIH it's a subset of the NIH said

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,760
about 50% of people thinks they

00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,530
shouldn't have management at all

00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,790
so it's kind of comforting to me to

00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:09,210
learn that even across industries we

00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:12,090
have similar feelings but I read about

00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:14,010
another thing they had they used a

00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:17,430
concept called a chairperson during

00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:19,620
their post mortems the idea of this was

00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:23,490
that the person presenting on the

00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:25,260
particular incident wouldn't lead the

00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:28,050
meeting they would worry about

00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,820
presenting the post mortem and someone

00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,920
else would facilitate the room they

00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,889
would control who spoke and so if you

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,809
allowed management

00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:36,489
present for instance you could make sure

00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:39,759
that they weren't able to turn it into a

00:13:36,489 --> 00:13:41,980
very blame flow environment and so we

00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:43,809
used similar things like this in other

00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,509
areas within tech but I've never used

00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:47,589
that for a post-mortem and I personally

00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:50,169
think this is something that I would

00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:54,790
like to use in my organization after all

00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:56,649
my reading there's another thing that I

00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:59,829
found that was interesting about

00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:03,699
medicine does anyone recognize this what

00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:06,910
this is this is what's called a fishbone

00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:10,209
diagram or an Ishikawa diagram it's a

00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:13,239
method used to tease out what caused an

00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:15,279
adverse effect I've used this in two

00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:17,319
separate organizations sometimes it's

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,689
surrounded by the by the fish and it

00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:20,739
sort of makes it clear what this is they

00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:23,379
use this in Eminem's

00:14:20,739 --> 00:14:25,329
leaves the exact same process the words

00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:26,889
change right

00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:28,600
we don't we don't use these particular

00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:31,600
words we don't talk about people in

00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,329
patients or equipment or environment or

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,569
maybe a medicinal organization but we

00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:39,970
talk about our off system or user

00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:44,079
actions or infrastructure actions the

00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:46,389
same way what I learned as I researched

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:49,299
is that for the most part we haven't

00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:51,069
really invented any of this but no one

00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:53,019
tells you that right no one tells you

00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:54,970
that this has mostly been adopted from

00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:56,470
other places but we don't keep

00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,850
reflecting on those other places we took

00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,279
it at a point in time and moved along

00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:02,439
and they've evolved and we've evolved

00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:06,939
but we never go back to see how we can

00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:10,059
learn from each other so what can we

00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:13,209
learn from these industries I think we

00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:15,399
can learn to treat each mistake as an

00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:17,379
opportunity I think we can learn to

00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:19,059
adapt some of their processes and

00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:19,419
respect the opportunity we have in a

00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:23,019
failure

00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:24,879
to find out more about our systems and I

00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:27,160
think honestly the the most important

00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,169
thing is to learn to take prevention

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,959
more seriously than the investigation

00:15:29,169 --> 00:15:33,279
itself I think in a post-mortem it's

00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:35,230
really hard to sort of turn that around

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,480
because we spend so much time worried

00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:39,309
about root cause analysis and then we

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,579
spend so little time on preventing it

00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:43,899
from happening again

00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:46,449
this is the fun thing about about

00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:47,999
post-mortems they create a record

00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:50,230
history that we can use to learn from

00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:54,489
but I don't really think we're learning

00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:57,040
from that history yet so more

00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:59,529
specifically with all this and all this

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:03,730
research how might we conduct a

00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:07,329
post-mortem post-mortems ultimately only

00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:10,359
have I would say three components we

00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:12,309
worry about why something happens we

00:16:10,359 --> 00:16:13,869
think about how could it have been even

00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:16,119
worse than this and we'll get into why

00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:18,939
that is later this is the learning from

00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:21,009
a failure and how can we make sure this

00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:21,999
never happens again because the worst

00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:23,679
scenario is that we have something

00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:29,859
happened we investigate it and we repeat

00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:32,769
history anyway that last one needs to

00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:34,600
take precedent over new work and that

00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:37,600
that is sort of going to be a repeated

00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:40,569
point if you don't take the the actions

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,989
seriously to prevent things you're just

00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:46,179
going to keep doing this so here's an

00:16:43,989 --> 00:16:47,709
example incident this follows very

00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:49,899
closely a process I use today in my

00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:51,399
organizations I've made it a little more

00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:52,660
general because we have some drill downs

00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:55,389
that are more specific to our product

00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:57,730
and you probably will too we start super

00:16:55,389 --> 00:17:00,819
high level we just start with a summary

00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:02,470
of what run wrong so here the incident

00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:04,809
was that the documentation for the

00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:07,389
Google Cloud Python library was

00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:09,250
unavailable for users doesn't really

00:17:07,389 --> 00:17:10,389
tell you what went wrong but it gives

00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,309
you a rough idea of what you're reading

00:17:10,389 --> 00:17:14,110
this is useful mostly because you're

00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:15,189
going to generate a lot of these you're

00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,480
going to forget when things happen and

00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:18,880
you need a quick way to find them this

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,490
tends to work pretty well for that it's

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,169
also useful for management leadership in

00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:26,019
a big organization I work at a rather

00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:27,939
large company so it's handy that people

00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:29,230
above me can have a very high-level idea

00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:32,620
of what's going on and where are we

00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:34,120
having issues the next thing you're

00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,659
going to talk about is what made it

00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,200
happen

00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:40,230
not necessarily what all happened but

00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:43,090
but how did this get triggered and so

00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:44,590
after investigation we found that as

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:47,289
part of our cleanup process for our

00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:48,850
repositories an engineer with right

00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:50,559
access to that development repository

00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,880
managed to delete the github pages

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,980
branch altogether from the repository

00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,769
which caused us to lose all our github

00:17:53,980 --> 00:18:00,160
pages documentation okay let's that's

00:17:56,769 --> 00:18:02,980
pretty bad okay

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:06,360
we're gonna worry about user impact how

00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:09,550
long was it how much did it affect them

00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:12,250
in this case for about two hours we

00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:13,360
didn't have documentation this means

00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,010
every user who tried to go to our

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,370
documentation suddenly gone Oh

00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:19,810
404 oh no you can't do that that's

00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,230
that's not great it could have been

00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,690
worse

00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:25,330
and no one likely lost money from this

00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:26,620
for instance so so this is this is not a

00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:28,600
terrible incident

00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:30,160
it's a little embarrassing though you

00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,450
know for that for the team is a

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,440
professional organization to do

00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:37,720
something like this it doesn't look very

00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:42,100
good so how did we notice that our

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:43,990
documentation went down in this instance

00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,660
we had a report from an external

00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:48,220
customer and this sort of adds to the

00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:51,490
maybe it's a little more embarrassing

00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:53,200
right typically in here you'll find that

00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,760
this is detected by some bots you have

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,220
or infrastructure the modders your

00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,380
system or a dashboard alert in this case

00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,580
that's not what happened we had a user

00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,990
that said hey I'm trying to use the

00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:04,930
documentation it seems unavailable

00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,190
what's going on and between the time

00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:09,010
that was reported it took us 30 minutes

00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,480
to notice that that's probably not great

00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:13,570
but all in all two and a half hours

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,510
maybe that's alright so how did we

00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:17,230
resolve it for this issue it's it's

00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,300
pretty straightforward

00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:22,590
we republished the github pages branch

00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:25,360
and the world kept turning it was fine

00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:27,570
that's about where management's probably

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,350
going to stop reading these reports

00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:31,540
beyond this it tends to get very

00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:33,940
technical it tends to get a lot more

00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,470
brainstorming but above that line is

00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,820
what you're going to show to management

00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,740
and help them understand what's going on

00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,450
with your system it tells you how big

00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,860
the problem was it tells you how you fix

00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,900
the problem it gives an idea of how long

00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,820
it took to fix the problem and then they

00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,350
can look at things like resourcing or

00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,390
prioritization and help you from that

00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:52,630
end but after this we're gonna get into

00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:55,510
the more Devi side of things what was

00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:57,730
the exact timeline of what happened not

00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:00,070
not rough hours or anything this is

00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:02,290
where it gets really interesting so you

00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:04,120
start to see things like this is a 9:45

00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:06,760
in the morning I work at a tech company

00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,350
so the majority the team probably wasn't

00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,090
even here yet or they're still finishing

00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:12,700
other breakfasts or getting coffee right

00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:13,630
and so that was deleted okay so some

00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,860
some some

00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,980
person came early of the office in the

00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:20,800
delete' of the branch and then an issue

00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,690
was filed like 40 minutes later and then

00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,120
you know 24 minutes later the team

00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:28,390
responded and okay they republished the

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,490
branch 10 minutes later but 50 minutes

00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,930
after that it was serving Docs so

00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,190
there's probably something interesting

00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,810
though that we didn't talk about before

00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,670
that from an engineering side we're

00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:38,410
going to probably want to dig into why

00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:44,830
did it take 50 minutes after publishing

00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:46,570
for our Docs to go live I think this is

00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:48,580
an interesting area what well won't went

00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:50,680
poorly and what got lucky of a post

00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,780
mortem process I haven't seen this used

00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,750
everywhere but for me this is sort of

00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:58,570
the fun part you look at what happened

00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:00,040
and you start to think is that is that

00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:02,860
really how it was supposed to work could

00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,570
we just kind of luck out could that it

00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,800
went worse you know how did this happen

00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,730
like what thing could we add to this

00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,470
that would make it worse you start

00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:13,510
brainstorming about non-existent failure

00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:15,190
so in this case we were notified pretty

00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:17,710
pretty quickly our customers able to get

00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:20,110
a hold of thing github issues but by the

00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:21,760
same note and we didn't know about it

00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:24,970
very fast right it still took us 30

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,650
minutes ish to realize it was there the

00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:28,270
real thing that we noticed one poorly is

00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:31,630
that you're able to delete the branch at

00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:33,970
all and github has controls for that

00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:35,140
right you can protect branches and it

00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:37,450
turns out for this particular repository

00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,250
we never enabled that because no one had

00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,840
ever tried to delete the github pages

00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:44,080
branch before and so no one ever noticed

00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,940
that it wasn't set and so there's a lot

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,040
we can look into this there's also a lot

00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,140
more notes about that 50 minutes I

00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,670
talked about that we found for our

00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:54,850
organization and the size of our github

00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:56,710
repo that we use for documentation it

00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:58,330
takes entirely too long for us to figure

00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:00,340
out if we failed

00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,780
to publish something correct and there's

00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,150
not a lot of logging we have access to

00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,080
and so probably going to want to do

00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:08,740
something to harden that up in the

00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:11,320
future and where did we get lucky well

00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:13,750
it turns out a member of the team had a

00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,700
copy of that branch so we didn't have to

00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,440
regenerate all the documentation or any

00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,090
of the scaffolding we just published it

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,290
from their dev box and then did the

00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,930
minor update that would have otherwise

00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:25,150
happened not a big deal it turns out

00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:26,110
that this was hugely helpful because

00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,290
without this I think it probably

00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:31,430
would've taken us another two

00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:33,050
to get this on line from these things

00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:34,550
from these final actions from the

00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:38,420
incident we can develop the most

00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:40,010
important part the action items so

00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:42,500
action items are going to fall into a

00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:44,390
category of five things we're going to

00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,490
either have to investigate the incident

00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:47,330
further that's a valid action item is

00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,410
that when you get done with the

00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,610
post-mortem you say we don't have enough

00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,230
information this is going to take

00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:53,240
someone to take down time as a dev and

00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:56,360
so we're going to have to have them look

00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:59,600
into that the other is that you're going

00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:01,220
to repair damage you're going to detect

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,110
future incidents you're going to

00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:05,530
mitigate future incidents you're going

00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:08,270
to prevent future incidents altogether

00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:10,220
so in this case we had a few things

00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:12,890
we're gonna turn on branch protection

00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:14,660
that's easy not gonna let that simple of

00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,740
a thing happen again but there's some

00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,140
other things that could still happen

00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:20,060
even with that on so we're going to need

00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,980
to figure out how to better debug our

00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,880
github pages and that's not a thing

00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,020
we're going to settle it in a

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,160
post-mortem meeting that's the thing

00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,680
where someone's going to have to have an

00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:30,560
action item on their calendar to go take

00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:33,020
care of and then we're going to also

00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,530
look and say maybe get our pages isn't

00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,990
for us

00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:37,250
a lot of people do this successfully and

00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,990
a lot of devs on our team

00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,910
myself included use github pages for

00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:42,440
smaller projects or on websites it works

00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:44,210
great but when you start to have

00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:51,650
gigabytes of information it seems to

00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:56,150
have a bit of a problem I think it's

00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:59,770
important to mention again that we have

00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:02,090
to fail if we have any hope of

00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:05,420
innovating we're gonna fail we're gonna

00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:07,160
make mistakes in my head this is what I

00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:10,070
hear when people say fail fast

00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:12,620
I don't like fail fast personally I

00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:15,350
think it implies that we intend to fail

00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:17,060
that's not the intention and that that's

00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:19,670
the other part is individual if act with

00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:22,130
good intention you don't have a team

00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:23,840
member whose goal today is to break your

00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:26,840
service that's not why they came into

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:30,830
work it's an accident and we can learn

00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:32,210
from the accident it's also important to

00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:34,340
remember that blame is in the deterrent

00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:36,610
unless your goal is to deter people on

00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:39,230
your team from doing their job

00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:41,250
that's the only way you don't fail is if

00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:43,050
you just don't do anything at all

00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:45,450
if you do that you won't fail it will

00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:46,980
work the problem is that's sort of

00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:48,390
against the other main goal we have

00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,920
which is to usually accomplish new

00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:53,120
things make money innovate for our

00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:55,050
customers and punishing a team member

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,100
doesn't help you it doesn't move your

00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:59,280
organization forward it doesn't really

00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:02,100
help your customers and I'm pretty sure

00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,300
if most people are anything like me they

00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:06,810
feel pretty bad already and they

00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:08,910
probably don't need your assistance this

00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:10,710
ultimately is just going to discourage

00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,910
transparency it's going to make it hard

00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,980
to find out what went wrong

00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,930
people will find ways to downplay what

00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:20,550
they did to preserve their self-image

00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:21,990
because they don't feel safe the other

00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:24,060
problem is if we excuse things this

00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:27,450
human err we're not gonna have a

00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:28,830
conversation about it if I just say that

00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:31,020
the Deaf on the team did this and they

00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:32,270
shouldn't do it again there's really no

00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,980
reason to do anything else

00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:37,500
why would I improve the process they are

00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,120
the problem the reality is we work

00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,790
within the process and the process is

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:45,890
always part of the problem if you do

00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:45,890
this you'll have a broken system still

00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:52,410
so a quick example of why we don't blame

00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:54,950
if you come to github and you see an

00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:57,180
issue that looks roughly like this

00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:58,350
probably a little freaked out you've

00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,430
done something you've made some change

00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:02,060
your code that's literally lighting

00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:04,560
computers on fire it's kind of a bad day

00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:06,600
but someone on your team is gonna sign

00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:10,160
it they're gonna look into it and then

00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:12,960
they're gonna just fix it that's cool

00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:14,760
this this might happen in a blameless

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,910
situation but it's almost certainly

00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:20,790
going to happen in a blindfold one why

00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:22,140
did something catch on fire what did we

00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:23,550
change what happened

00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:26,880
oh it's cool they they knew what was

00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:28,020
wrong they fixed it it's great that

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,280
we're not lighting computers on fire

00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,710
anymore but we've done nothing to make

00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,510
sure we don't do it again and if you're

00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:38,340
in a blame ful environment this is going

00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:42,030
to happen all the time so how are you

00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:43,320
gonna build this blameless culture the

00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:45,180
first thing you need to do is create

00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,100
psychological safety for yourself and

00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:48,420
your co-workers because an environment

00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,570
where we feel that we're going to be

00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:52,590
blamed for anything that we do is an

00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:55,310
environment we're not going to do

00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:55,310
anything

00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:00,310
there's a site that was released called

00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:03,210
rework from Google that talks about team

00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:05,380
building but this particular diagram is

00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:08,440
very much relevant for building

00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:09,970
blameless environments the most

00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,130
important thing before anything else is

00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:14,770
creating psychological safety until you

00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:16,960
do that you can't depend on your team

00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:18,700
they can't depend on you you're not

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,950
going to have clarity it's gonna be hard

00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:24,220
to build structure it's also gonna hard

00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:25,720
for anyone to have impact everything is

00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,700
going to derive from this so until you

00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,790
do that most everything you're doing is

00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:34,000
a waste the other thing you can do is

00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:35,500
find positive examples I intentionally

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,510
didn't bring up sre which is a

00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:40,660
discipline within technology site

00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:42,340
reliability engineering because I think

00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,830
they already do this most all the time

00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:46,450
their job is to make sure websites keep

00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,220
running services keep running and the

00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:50,110
rest of us can build new stuff they

00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:52,060
helped us build processes and help us

00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:54,280
avoid future incidents so there are

00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:56,170
plenty of examples this is just one too

00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,550
book published by O'Reilly written by

00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:00,100
Google engineers about how site

00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:01,720
reliability engineering works it's a

00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,550
pretty easy read I thought it was very

00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,920
informative but there are a lot of other

00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:10,510
examples in Eminem's and NTSB I would

00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:12,640
encourage you read more about this the

00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:15,040
other thing again to remind yourself is

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,050
outages will always happen and no one on

00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,640
your team wanted them to happen and if

00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:24,790
you find yourself ever wanting to blame

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:26,290
someone just recall that so to close I

00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:28,240
wanted to bring up a test for

00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:31,540
blamelessness of that incident we talked

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,670
about you might start and just say that

00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:36,910
a script is executed and deleted the

00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:41,140
production database right that's that

00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:42,970
seems fine but interesting enough that's

00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:44,410
kind of passive and someone had to run

00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:45,820
the script it likely didn't run itself

00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:47,020
and so in an environment where you want

00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,570
to make the script run itself is

00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:51,520
probably kind of blame 'full maybe we

00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:53,650
get to the next place an engineer on the

00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,790
team executed this script this is pretty

00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,450
good I mean at least you're saying

00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:57,370
someone did it

00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:59,140
you are hiding information about who

00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:00,760
they are but in some environments that

00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,590
might be good right if you don't think

00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,300
that broader than your team is going to

00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:06,010
feel this way you might not want you to

00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:07,169
put someone's name all on sorts of docks

00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,970
that get distributed

00:29:07,169 --> 00:29:12,249
but if you can manage to have a truly

00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:13,840
blameless culture you could say that

00:29:12,249 --> 00:29:16,269
Chris executed a script that deleted the

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,679
production database now didn't we talked

00:29:16,269 --> 00:29:19,059
about was me because I'm the only person

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,570
on my team that's ever in the office

00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:24,820
that early in the morning and I did it

00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:26,440
by accident we had a hundred branches

00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,789
that were stale and our github pages

00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,259
Brants that it was stale too because we

00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:32,499
hadn't released the documentation in a

00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:33,669
bit and I deleted it but I didn't have

00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:35,080
to worry about saying that because no

00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:38,519
one on my team was going to look at me

00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,519
and say why do you work here okay

00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:54,279
someone is thinking this right now

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,350
there's a quote from an economist I like

00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:57,789
a lot that says if you've never missed a

00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:00,249
flight you're probably spending entirely

00:29:57,789 --> 00:30:02,169
too much time in an airport if you're

00:30:00,249 --> 00:30:06,369
never failing you're probably not trying

00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:09,070
very hard you know you can do you can

00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:11,169
break your own stuff this is really fun

00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:12,580
if you haven't done this do this I'm not

00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:15,039
going to go into a talk about creating

00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:18,309
chaos monkeys but you should definitely

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:19,960
look into it the other thing is your SLA

00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:22,029
might be too low if you're not breaking

00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,240
yourself just throw some nines on there

00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:26,440
you'll you'll have some new problems so

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,809
thank you all it was great to talk to

00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:32,049
you about this I will take questions in

00:30:28,809 --> 00:30:34,980
the hallway or at lunch as lightning

00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:34,980
talks maybe start a next door

00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:45,180
[Applause]

00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:45,180
