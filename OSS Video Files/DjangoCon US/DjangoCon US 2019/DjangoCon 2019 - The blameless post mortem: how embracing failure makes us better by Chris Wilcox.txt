	DjangoCon 2019 - The blameless post mortem: how embracing failure makes us better by Chris Wilcox

In today’s world of developing services we tend to move fast and with that comes mistakes. This talk will discuss using post-mortems to turn incidents into opportunities for improvement, instead of just an opportunity to assign blame.

This talk was presented at: https://2019.djangocon.us/talks/the-blameless-post-mortem-how-embracing/

00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:19,099
so I don't start off on sort of a

00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,279
positive note since most of this talking

00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:24,710
at pretty negative software's pretty

00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:27,680
incredible in the 20 years that I've

00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:30,170
worked with technology I think it's safe

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,760
to say that it's evolved we've come a

00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,449
long way from where everyone started in

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,519
the 1990s when I was originally starting

00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:39,890
my journey into using a computer the

00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:41,480
internet was a small thing I would have

00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:45,500
never imagined the sort of speeds we

00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,839
could get now or the size of it we've

00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,540
also come from a place where websites

00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:54,620
have come from a place where they were a

00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:56,390
very simple small site single purpose to

00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,940
having multiple services interlinked

00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,339
with complicated off complicated

00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:05,059
security problems multi-regional

00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:06,710
deployments and many more things and it

00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:09,979
turns out when your software gets more

00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:11,299
amazing so do your bugs that's part of

00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:13,610
the evolution we don't get to have one

00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:15,350
without the other so it's reasonable

00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,280
expect as we continue our failure modes

00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,240
are gonna keep evolving

00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,270
they're gonna keep getting more

00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:24,909
complicated and harder to deal with and

00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:29,229
we're going to fail so I was thinking

00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:31,340
what if we saw this is an opportunity

00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:32,840
what if instead of seeing this as a

00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,189
reason to run away from computers and

00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,179
say this is all a big mistake we should

00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:36,740
have all just been gardeners and

00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:38,719
janitors and never talked about these

00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,939
computers maybe we could learn from

00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,039
these bugs maybe we could take these

00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:46,189
negative experiences and use them for

00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:49,520
positive gain this is what post-mortems

00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:51,619
give us they give us a way to learn to

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,560
grow as a team to deliver more things

00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:57,859
for our customers to be more successful

00:01:53,560 --> 00:02:00,439
we can do this through failure but

00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:02,780
there's an interesting thing this only

00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:06,200
works if everyone on your team feels

00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:08,030
safe to fail it only works if they feel

00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,520
open to share when they make a mistake

00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:13,540
so we can all learn from it and then we

00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,280
can prepare better for future failures

00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,660
so before I get too far into the talk I

00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,819
just kind of wanted to take a second to

00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,440
talk about myself I spent most of my

00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:24,049
time in my career working for large

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,920
companies I started working on dotnet

00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:26,630
websites

00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,520
but then I moved on to working on IDs

00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:31,550
and compilers cloud services and

00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:33,260
building cloud platforms today I spend

00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,990
most of my time working on the client

00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:38,090
libraries for Google cloud for seven

00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:43,970
different languages - being one of my

00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:46,670
personal focuses I think it's

00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:50,390
interesting to reflect on why we call it

00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:52,940
a bug we have these these failures in

00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,590
our code these problems but we didn't

00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,360
just choose the word bug the issue is at

00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,250
a certain point in time they were

00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,100
literal bugs we could see them we could

00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,959
spot them they cause problems in relays

00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:06,530
and as far as I know this is the first

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,430
computer science post-mortem this is an

00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,560
example of a moss

00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,410
taped to a sheet of paper describing a

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,800
time stamp what went wrong and what the

00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:17,900
problem was I kind of wish it was this

00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,459
easy to show the problems that our

00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,760
software systems have I've never been

00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:26,060
able to tape it to a sheet of paper but

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,530
here it is so our systems have evolved

00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:30,170
the the failures have gotten harder but

00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,269
we still do the same processes the

00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:34,310
problem now is they aren't moths they're

00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:36,290
cosmic rays service interruptions

00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,860
complicated failure between your two

00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:41,269
micro service and some officers to use

00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,500
so maybe it's not going to be single

00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:45,350
pointed but we can still use this

00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,739
process I also think what's interesting

00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:50,989
there's nowhere on this as there blame I

00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:54,560
mean we don't blame them off for falling

00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:55,910
into the relay it happened we can set up

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,700
things to the moth can't get and the

00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,840
relay again but blaming something isn't

00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:04,250
going to move us forward it's not gonna

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,780
prevent future failure so we can look at

00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,870
our own past but we can also look at

00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,160
other industries there are a few other

00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:13,100
industries that I want to talk about

00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:16,250
that find ways to handle these complex

00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,840
scenarios in their environment and I

00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,959
think we can use these to look back at

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,620
software and for the industries I'm

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,740
going to pick VB will some pretty

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,120
serious subjects I think at one point or

00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,070
another everyone says the phrase yeah

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,720
it's life or death but for a lot of

00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,099
industries that's true that's what they

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,349
deal with day in and day out they deal

00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:38,720
with people's lives and the outcomes of

00:04:36,349 --> 00:04:44,000
their situations directly effect

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:46,130
that but they all have the same thing in

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,320
common that I think Tec does and that we

00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:50,690
can learn from our mistakes and we can

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,030
improve our systems and if we can find

00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,920
ways to shift from blame to invest

00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,620
saving systems the reasons things go

00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:00,950
wrong and put in place Prevention's we

00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,990
can grow the thing is a lot of cultures

00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:05,330
and organizations are gonna focus on

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,710
blaming individuals I would say the

00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:09,320
culture we exist on outside of tech

00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,450
defaults as to this we want to look at

00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,670
someone and say it it's their fault they

00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:16,160
did it but if you really reflect on that

00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:17,270
that didn't solve your problem and at

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,380
least for me personally it doesn't

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,600
really make me feel better

00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,280
it makes someone else feel worse it

00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,560
doesn't move you forward so why are we

00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,110
doing it at all so let's look at some

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,860
other industries I want to start by

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:33,320
talking about the NTSB the NTSB is a

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,780
u.s. organization that monitors rails

00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:39,320
highways aviation pipelines and

00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:43,210
hazardous material transportation they

00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:47,030
exist to investigate incidents accidents

00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:50,810
failure modes during transportation that

00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:53,540
affect people like I said a lot of their

00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:55,910
failures are pretty serious all right

00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:59,510
I'm airplanes when they crash I have

00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:01,040
some pretty disastrous outcomes so

00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:05,240
there's there's an interesting aspect to

00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,740
the NTSB they aren't prosecutors they

00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,680
cannot use the evidence collected in

00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:13,010
their investigation to blame someone or

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,780
hold them legally accountable they can

00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,270
prevent this in the future they can take

00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,040
actions change processes change

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:23,330
regulations but they cannot use this

00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,950
incident to hold you at fault we have

00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:27,320
other organizations so in the u.s. we

00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:29,570
have the FAA we have the FBI they're

00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,060
going to handle that part but the NTSB

00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:35,120
is solely concerned with how do we avoid

00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:37,700
this this terrible thing happened how do

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:42,860
we not do it again and that environment

00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:44,600
blame has no place so as I said they've

00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,640
provided a lot of safety recommendations

00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:50,380
through this about 13,000 them to date

00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,600
and they do this with a few techniques

00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,610
with

00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,190
blame people are open to share their

00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:58,830
faults and then we see from people's

00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:02,460
mistakes even if they're inside the

00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:03,150
process that's the faults right that's

00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,590
what caused it

00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,790
there was something that went wrong and

00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,330
we'll talk about an example from the

00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:11,760
NTSB in a bit but if you blame them

00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:13,200
they're not going to share that they're

00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,940
gonna sit quietly in the corner and wait

00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,560
for someone else to say anything at all

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,540
they can maybe explain this other than

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,100
what they did but an environment without

00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,270
blame people share openly and you can

00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,190
move forward and you can start to figure

00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:25,230
out how a lot of times incidents aren't

00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,400
single pointed at all there's a few

00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,320
things that have to work together and we

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,550
have no hope of learning from that and

00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:34,470
preventing in the future unless we

00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:37,590
understand all of those aspects so

00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:40,560
here's an NTSB report they start fairly

00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:42,960
boring I would say this to me wreck is

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,940
very recognizable with design documents

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,400
that I've used in engineering it

00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,740
describes a very factual situation

00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,540
something happens in this case they say

00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,340
it was an accident says that there are

00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,110
injuries in this case there weren't any

00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,420
injuries and they say what did it cost

00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:01,530
ultimately what was the cost of this

00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:02,940
event so you don't really gather too

00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:05,070
much from this to get some weather and

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,870
then they tend to include things like

00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:08,610
pictures and for me this makes this very

00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,250
very easy ok so there's an accident

00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:13,260
there's a collision that boat appears to

00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:16,530
have a hole in it that's probably the

00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:20,910
problem right so how did we get here how

00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:22,230
did we get to this this place in this

00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,150
particular accident

00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:25,410
they found that certain processes

00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,360
weren't followed but they also found

00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:29,370
that the process that exists didn't

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,110
necessarily cover the situation they

00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,760
were in and so the flexibilities in the

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,560
existing processes and recommendations

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,669
allowed people to have this failure

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,260
happen so at the end of the report is

00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:42,539
where these recommendations come in in

00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,370
this case one of the things that wasn't

00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:46,590
happening was there was no one on

00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:50,070
Lookout on a ship now it turns out if

00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:51,630
you have two vehicles on an open plane

00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,220
and eventually they're going to

00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,240
intersect if no one does anything to

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,830
stop that

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,920
and so these boats ran into each other

00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,120
and they're very lucky that no one is

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,089
injured but they treated it with the

00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,040
same seriousness if someone was and from

00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:05,580
this we're able to devise new situations

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,020
for how you out

00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:11,130
communicate and how you ought to look

00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:12,360
out I think this is probably the most

00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:15,780
important thing that we can learn from

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,120
the NTSB there are plenty of

00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,230
post-mortems I have seen where we go

00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,940
through the work to find out what went

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,700
wrong but we often don't think about

00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,620
preventive measures this is likely the

00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,990
most important thing the rest of it that

00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:33,450
describes what happened it's informative

00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:36,380
but it's not actionable the other

00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:40,620
industry I wanted to talk about was M&M

00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:42,570
conferences so mmm doesn't literally

00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,340
mean the Mars and Marie's candies that

00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:47,460
we've all probably an entirely too many

00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:49,860
of I mean morbidity and mortality so

00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:52,710
it's a slight bit more serious so the

00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,730
healthcare industry remember I said the

00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,450
beginning some of these people deal with

00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,170
life and death

00:09:54,450 --> 00:10:00,390
quite literally so the thing about

00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:02,690
morbidity and mortality conferences is

00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,920
they have very similar goals to the NTSB

00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,660
the words change a little bit they care

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,880
about patient outcomes they care about

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,880
educating practitioners so they can do a

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,190
better job with patient care but this

00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,410
almost always is used not for your sort

00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:19,470
of routine failures but your more

00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:21,600
complex ones where possibly multiple

00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,310
physicians or facilities or

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,630
organizations that are involved when

00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,550
things start to get more complicated and

00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:32,120
you can't simply describe it as a very

00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:35,280
single point so the photo on my slide I

00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:39,090
don't know about all y'all out there but

00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:41,700
this looks pretty adversarial to me this

00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:45,000
is this is from a television show from

00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,230
the perspective of the presenter and if

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,820
people are looking at me like that I'm

00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,830
I'm not gonna be very open to share I

00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,270
I'm not I'm gonna feel uncomfortable

00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,380
sharing my faults that's for sure I'm

00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,330
not about to tell you I did anything

00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,740
wrong because I think you're waiting for

00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:59,370
that that's that's what you're looking

00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:02,250
for it is a dramatic portrayal it's from

00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:04,110
a television show and at a certain point

00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,640
in time this is what M&M conferences

00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,410
looked like looked like senior

00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,380
physicians hospital management sitting

00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:12,450
with you and telling telling you you

00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,370
know to profess everything you've ever

00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,390
done wrong so that way they can put the

00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,120
fault on you and it wasn't the

00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:19,230
hospital's fault and that's it but we

00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,610
don't learn from that and

00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:25,530
people don't share in that they they

00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:27,510
tend to they tend to get quiet I'm

00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:29,900
hoping that it wouldn't surprise anyone

00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:33,120
that this isn't common practice anymore

00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:35,220
the medicine industry learned that that

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,050
dramatic portrayal which was more common

00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,140
wasn't producing the sort of result they

00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:43,080
wanted they were hoping to educate

00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:45,540
people they're hoping to inform

00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,280
physicians organizations hospitals and

00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,470
better ways to practice medicine that

00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,970
result in better outcomes you weren't

00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,470
going to get that with an adversarial

00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:57,650
panel but you might get that with a

00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:57,650
lecture hall so they changed the setting

00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:03,260
you have now taken a situation that I

00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:07,350
think you would say was full of animus

00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:09,510
and you've replaced with curiosity this

00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:11,340
simple change of setting was the exact

00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:15,750
same thing can change everything about

00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:17,850
how people view this there's another

00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,770
thing I thought was interesting when

00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,970
reading about I'm announced is they have

00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:22,860
a lot of conversations about who should

00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:26,880
be present and who should be able to

00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:28,080
talk when present this this related very

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,300
much to me in tech I've had similar

00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,640
conversations about this usually this

00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,440
takes the turn of should management be

00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,330
in the room should people who are not

00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,960
ICS we're not developers be in the room

00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:41,430
for a post-mortem because whether we

00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,050
like it or not there's a power dynamic

00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,540
there and so if you're managers in the

00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:48,720
room you might feel less open to admit

00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:51,630
you've done something wrong and it turns

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,340
out within within medicine they're

00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:55,920
basically in split on the two so the

00:12:53,340 --> 00:13:00,000
stat I read from the the NCBI

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,470
the NIH it's a subset of the NIH said

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,760
about 50% of people thinks they

00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,530
shouldn't have management at all

00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,790
so it's kind of comforting to me to

00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:09,210
learn that even across industries we

00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:12,090
have similar feelings but I read about

00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:14,010
another thing they had they used a

00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:17,430
concept called a chairperson during

00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:19,620
their post mortems the idea of this was

00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:23,490
that the person presenting on the

00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:25,260
particular incident wouldn't lead the

00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:28,050
meeting they would worry about

00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,820
presenting the post mortem and someone

00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,920
else would facilitate the room they

00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,889
would control who spoke and so if you

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,809
allowed management

00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:36,489
present for instance you could make sure

00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:39,759
that they weren't able to turn it into a

00:13:36,489 --> 00:13:41,980
very blame flow environment and so we

00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:43,809
used similar things like this in other

00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,509
areas within tech but I've never used

00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:47,589
that for a post-mortem and I personally

00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:50,169
think this is something that I would

00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:54,790
like to use in my organization after all

00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:56,649
my reading there's another thing that I

00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:59,829
found that was interesting about

00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:03,699
medicine does anyone recognize this what

00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:06,910
this is this is what's called a fishbone

00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:10,209
diagram or an Ishikawa diagram it's a

00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:13,239
method used to tease out what caused an

00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:15,279
adverse effect I've used this in two

00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:17,319
separate organizations sometimes it's

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,689
surrounded by the by the fish and it

00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:20,739
sort of makes it clear what this is they

00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:23,379
use this in Eminem's

00:14:20,739 --> 00:14:25,329
leaves the exact same process the words

00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:26,889
change right

00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:28,600
we don't we don't use these particular

00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:31,600
words we don't talk about people in

00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,329
patients or equipment or environment or

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,569
maybe a medicinal organization but we

00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:39,970
talk about our off system or user

00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:44,079
actions or infrastructure actions the

00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:46,389
same way what I learned as I researched

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:49,299
is that for the most part we haven't

00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:51,069
really invented any of this but no one

00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:53,019
tells you that right no one tells you

00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:54,970
that this has mostly been adopted from

00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:56,470
other places but we don't keep

00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,850
reflecting on those other places we took

00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,279
it at a point in time and moved along

00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:02,439
and they've evolved and we've evolved

00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:06,939
but we never go back to see how we can

00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:10,059
learn from each other so what can we

00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:13,209
learn from these industries I think we

00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:15,399
can learn to treat each mistake as an

00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:17,379
opportunity I think we can learn to

00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:19,059
adapt some of their processes and

00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:19,419
respect the opportunity we have in a

00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:23,019
failure

00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:24,879
to find out more about our systems and I

00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:27,160
think honestly the the most important

00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,169
thing is to learn to take prevention

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,959
more seriously than the investigation

00:15:29,169 --> 00:15:33,279
itself I think in a post-mortem it's

00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:35,230
really hard to sort of turn that around

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,480
because we spend so much time worried

00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:39,309
about root cause analysis and then we

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,579
spend so little time on preventing it

00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:43,899
from happening again

00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:46,449
this is the fun thing about about

00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:47,999
post-mortems they create a record

00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:50,230
history that we can use to learn from

00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:54,489
but I don't really think we're learning

00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:57,040
from that history yet so more

00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:59,529
specifically with all this and all this

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:03,730
research how might we conduct a

00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:07,329
post-mortem post-mortems ultimately only

00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:10,359
have I would say three components we

00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:12,309
worry about why something happens we

00:16:10,359 --> 00:16:13,869
think about how could it have been even

00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:16,119
worse than this and we'll get into why

00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:18,939
that is later this is the learning from

00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:21,009
a failure and how can we make sure this

00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:21,999
never happens again because the worst

00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:23,679
scenario is that we have something

00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:29,859
happened we investigate it and we repeat

00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:32,769
history anyway that last one needs to

00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:34,600
take precedent over new work and that

00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:37,600
that is sort of going to be a repeated

00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:40,569
point if you don't take the the actions

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,989
seriously to prevent things you're just

00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:46,179
going to keep doing this so here's an

00:16:43,989 --> 00:16:47,709
example incident this follows very

00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:49,899
closely a process I use today in my

00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:51,399
organizations I've made it a little more

00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:52,660
general because we have some drill downs

00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:55,389
that are more specific to our product

00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:57,730
and you probably will too we start super

00:16:55,389 --> 00:17:00,819
high level we just start with a summary

00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:02,470
of what run wrong so here the incident

00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:04,809
was that the documentation for the

00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:07,389
Google Cloud Python library was

00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:09,250
unavailable for users doesn't really

00:17:07,389 --> 00:17:10,389
tell you what went wrong but it gives

00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,309
you a rough idea of what you're reading

00:17:10,389 --> 00:17:14,110
this is useful mostly because you're

00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:15,189
going to generate a lot of these you're

00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,480
going to forget when things happen and

00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:18,880
you need a quick way to find them this

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,490
tends to work pretty well for that it's

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,169
also useful for management leadership in

00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:26,019
a big organization I work at a rather

00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:27,939
large company so it's handy that people

00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:29,230
above me can have a very high-level idea

00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:32,620
of what's going on and where are we

00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:34,120
having issues the next thing you're

00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,659
going to talk about is what made it

00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,200
happen

00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:40,230
not necessarily what all happened but

00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:43,090
but how did this get triggered and so

00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:44,590
after investigation we found that as

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:47,289
part of our cleanup process for our

00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:48,850
repositories an engineer with right

00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:50,559
access to that development repository

00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,880
managed to delete the github pages

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,980
branch altogether from the repository

00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,769
which caused us to lose all our github

00:17:53,980 --> 00:18:00,160
pages documentation okay let's that's

00:17:56,769 --> 00:18:02,980
pretty bad okay

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:06,360
we're gonna worry about user impact how

00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:09,550
long was it how much did it affect them

00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:12,250
in this case for about two hours we

00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:13,360
didn't have documentation this means

00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,010
every user who tried to go to our

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,370
documentation suddenly gone Oh

00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:19,810
404 oh no you can't do that that's

00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,230
that's not great it could have been

00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,690
worse

00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:25,330
and no one likely lost money from this

00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:26,620
for instance so so this is this is not a

00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:28,600
terrible incident

00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:30,160
it's a little embarrassing though you

00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,450
know for that for the team is a

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,440
professional organization to do

00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:37,720
something like this it doesn't look very

00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:42,100
good so how did we notice that our

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:43,990
documentation went down in this instance

00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,660
we had a report from an external

00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:48,220
customer and this sort of adds to the

00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:51,490
maybe it's a little more embarrassing

00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:53,200
right typically in here you'll find that

00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,760
this is detected by some bots you have

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,220
or infrastructure the modders your

00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,380
system or a dashboard alert in this case

00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,580
that's not what happened we had a user

00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,990
that said hey I'm trying to use the

00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:04,930
documentation it seems unavailable

00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,190
what's going on and between the time

00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:09,010
that was reported it took us 30 minutes

00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,480
to notice that that's probably not great

00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:13,570
but all in all two and a half hours

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,510
maybe that's alright so how did we

00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:17,230
resolve it for this issue it's it's

00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,300
pretty straightforward

00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:22,590
we republished the github pages branch

00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:25,360
and the world kept turning it was fine

00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:27,570
that's about where management's probably

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,350
going to stop reading these reports

00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:31,540
beyond this it tends to get very

00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:33,940
technical it tends to get a lot more

00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,470
brainstorming but above that line is

00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,820
what you're going to show to management

00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,740
and help them understand what's going on

00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,450
with your system it tells you how big

00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,860
the problem was it tells you how you fix

00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,900
the problem it gives an idea of how long

00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,820
it took to fix the problem and then they

00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,350
can look at things like resourcing or

00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,390
prioritization and help you from that

00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:52,630
end but after this we're gonna get into

00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:55,510
the more Devi side of things what was

00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:57,730
the exact timeline of what happened not

00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:00,070
not rough hours or anything this is

00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:02,290
where it gets really interesting so you

00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:04,120
start to see things like this is a 9:45

00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:06,760
in the morning I work at a tech company

00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,350
so the majority the team probably wasn't

00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,090
even here yet or they're still finishing

00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:12,700
other breakfasts or getting coffee right

00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:13,630
and so that was deleted okay so some

00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,860
some some

00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,980
person came early of the office in the

00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:20,800
delete' of the branch and then an issue

00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,690
was filed like 40 minutes later and then

00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,120
you know 24 minutes later the team

00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:28,390
responded and okay they republished the

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,490
branch 10 minutes later but 50 minutes

00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,930
after that it was serving Docs so

00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,190
there's probably something interesting

00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,810
though that we didn't talk about before

00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,670
that from an engineering side we're

00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:38,410
going to probably want to dig into why

00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:44,830
did it take 50 minutes after publishing

00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:46,570
for our Docs to go live I think this is

00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:48,580
an interesting area what well won't went

00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:50,680
poorly and what got lucky of a post

00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,780
mortem process I haven't seen this used

00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,750
everywhere but for me this is sort of

00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:58,570
the fun part you look at what happened

00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:00,040
and you start to think is that is that

00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:02,860
really how it was supposed to work could

00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,570
we just kind of luck out could that it

00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,800
went worse you know how did this happen

00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,730
like what thing could we add to this

00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,470
that would make it worse you start

00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:13,510
brainstorming about non-existent failure

00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:15,190
so in this case we were notified pretty

00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:17,710
pretty quickly our customers able to get

00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:20,110
a hold of thing github issues but by the

00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:21,760
same note and we didn't know about it

00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:24,970
very fast right it still took us 30

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,650
minutes ish to realize it was there the

00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:28,270
real thing that we noticed one poorly is

00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:31,630
that you're able to delete the branch at

00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:33,970
all and github has controls for that

00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:35,140
right you can protect branches and it

00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:37,450
turns out for this particular repository

00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,250
we never enabled that because no one had

00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,840
ever tried to delete the github pages

00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:44,080
branch before and so no one ever noticed

00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,940
that it wasn't set and so there's a lot

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,040
we can look into this there's also a lot

00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,140
more notes about that 50 minutes I

00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,670
talked about that we found for our

00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:54,850
organization and the size of our github

00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:56,710
repo that we use for documentation it

00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:58,330
takes entirely too long for us to figure

00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:00,340
out if we failed

00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,780
to publish something correct and there's

00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,150
not a lot of logging we have access to

00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,080
and so probably going to want to do

00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:08,740
something to harden that up in the

00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:11,320
future and where did we get lucky well

00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:13,750
it turns out a member of the team had a

00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,700
copy of that branch so we didn't have to

00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,440
regenerate all the documentation or any

00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,090
of the scaffolding we just published it

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,290
from their dev box and then did the

00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,930
minor update that would have otherwise

00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:25,150
happened not a big deal it turns out

00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:26,110
that this was hugely helpful because

00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,290
without this I think it probably

00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:31,430
would've taken us another two

00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:33,050
to get this on line from these things

00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:34,550
from these final actions from the

00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:38,420
incident we can develop the most

00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:40,010
important part the action items so

00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:42,500
action items are going to fall into a

00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:44,390
category of five things we're going to

00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,490
either have to investigate the incident

00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:47,330
further that's a valid action item is

00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,410
that when you get done with the

00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,610
post-mortem you say we don't have enough

00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,230
information this is going to take

00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:53,240
someone to take down time as a dev and

00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:56,360
so we're going to have to have them look

00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:59,600
into that the other is that you're going

00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:01,220
to repair damage you're going to detect

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,110
future incidents you're going to

00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:05,530
mitigate future incidents you're going

00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:08,270
to prevent future incidents altogether

00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:10,220
so in this case we had a few things

00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:12,890
we're gonna turn on branch protection

00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:14,660
that's easy not gonna let that simple of

00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,740
a thing happen again but there's some

00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,140
other things that could still happen

00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:20,060
even with that on so we're going to need

00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,980
to figure out how to better debug our

00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,880
github pages and that's not a thing

00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,020
we're going to settle it in a

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,160
post-mortem meeting that's the thing

00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,680
where someone's going to have to have an

00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:30,560
action item on their calendar to go take

00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:33,020
care of and then we're going to also

00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,530
look and say maybe get our pages isn't

00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,990
for us

00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:37,250
a lot of people do this successfully and

00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,990
a lot of devs on our team

00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,910
myself included use github pages for

00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:42,440
smaller projects or on websites it works

00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:44,210
great but when you start to have

00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:51,650
gigabytes of information it seems to

00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:56,150
have a bit of a problem I think it's

00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:59,770
important to mention again that we have

00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:02,090
to fail if we have any hope of

00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:05,420
innovating we're gonna fail we're gonna

00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:07,160
make mistakes in my head this is what I

00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:10,070
hear when people say fail fast

00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:12,620
I don't like fail fast personally I

00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:15,350
think it implies that we intend to fail

00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:17,060
that's not the intention and that that's

00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:19,670
the other part is individual if act with

00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:22,130
good intention you don't have a team

00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:23,840
member whose goal today is to break your

00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:26,840
service that's not why they came into

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:30,830
work it's an accident and we can learn

00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:32,210
from the accident it's also important to

00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:34,340
remember that blame is in the deterrent

00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:36,610
unless your goal is to deter people on

00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:39,230
your team from doing their job

00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:41,250
that's the only way you don't fail is if

00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:43,050
you just don't do anything at all

00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:45,450
if you do that you won't fail it will

00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:46,980
work the problem is that's sort of

00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:48,390
against the other main goal we have

00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,920
which is to usually accomplish new

00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:53,120
things make money innovate for our

00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:55,050
customers and punishing a team member

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,100
doesn't help you it doesn't move your

00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:59,280
organization forward it doesn't really

00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:02,100
help your customers and I'm pretty sure

00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,300
if most people are anything like me they

00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:06,810
feel pretty bad already and they

00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:08,910
probably don't need your assistance this

00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:10,710
ultimately is just going to discourage

00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,910
transparency it's going to make it hard

00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,980
to find out what went wrong

00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,930
people will find ways to downplay what

00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:20,550
they did to preserve their self-image

00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:21,990
because they don't feel safe the other

00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:24,060
problem is if we excuse things this

00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:27,450
human err we're not gonna have a

00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:28,830
conversation about it if I just say that

00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:31,020
the Deaf on the team did this and they

00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:32,270
shouldn't do it again there's really no

00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,980
reason to do anything else

00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:37,500
why would I improve the process they are

00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,120
the problem the reality is we work

00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,790
within the process and the process is

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:45,890
always part of the problem if you do

00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:45,890
this you'll have a broken system still

00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:52,410
so a quick example of why we don't blame

00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:54,950
if you come to github and you see an

00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:57,180
issue that looks roughly like this

00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:58,350
probably a little freaked out you've

00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,430
done something you've made some change

00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:02,060
your code that's literally lighting

00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:04,560
computers on fire it's kind of a bad day

00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:06,600
but someone on your team is gonna sign

00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:10,160
it they're gonna look into it and then

00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:12,960
they're gonna just fix it that's cool

00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:14,760
this this might happen in a blameless

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,910
situation but it's almost certainly

00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:20,790
going to happen in a blindfold one why

00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:22,140
did something catch on fire what did we

00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:23,550
change what happened

00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:26,880
oh it's cool they they knew what was

00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:28,020
wrong they fixed it it's great that

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,280
we're not lighting computers on fire

00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,710
anymore but we've done nothing to make

00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,510
sure we don't do it again and if you're

00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:38,340
in a blame ful environment this is going

00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:42,030
to happen all the time so how are you

00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:43,320
gonna build this blameless culture the

00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:45,180
first thing you need to do is create

00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,100
psychological safety for yourself and

00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:48,420
your co-workers because an environment

00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,570
where we feel that we're going to be

00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:52,590
blamed for anything that we do is an

00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:55,310
environment we're not going to do

00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:55,310
anything

00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:00,310
there's a site that was released called

00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:03,210
rework from Google that talks about team

00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:05,380
building but this particular diagram is

00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:08,440
very much relevant for building

00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:09,970
blameless environments the most

00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,130
important thing before anything else is

00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:14,770
creating psychological safety until you

00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:16,960
do that you can't depend on your team

00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:18,700
they can't depend on you you're not

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,950
going to have clarity it's gonna be hard

00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:24,220
to build structure it's also gonna hard

00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:25,720
for anyone to have impact everything is

00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,700
going to derive from this so until you

00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,790
do that most everything you're doing is

00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:34,000
a waste the other thing you can do is

00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:35,500
find positive examples I intentionally

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,510
didn't bring up sre which is a

00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:40,660
discipline within technology site

00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:42,340
reliability engineering because I think

00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,830
they already do this most all the time

00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:46,450
their job is to make sure websites keep

00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,220
running services keep running and the

00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:50,110
rest of us can build new stuff they

00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:52,060
helped us build processes and help us

00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:54,280
avoid future incidents so there are

00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:56,170
plenty of examples this is just one too

00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,550
book published by O'Reilly written by

00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:00,100
Google engineers about how site

00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:01,720
reliability engineering works it's a

00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,550
pretty easy read I thought it was very

00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,920
informative but there are a lot of other

00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:10,510
examples in Eminem's and NTSB I would

00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:12,640
encourage you read more about this the

00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:15,040
other thing again to remind yourself is

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,050
outages will always happen and no one on

00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,640
your team wanted them to happen and if

00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:24,790
you find yourself ever wanting to blame

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:26,290
someone just recall that so to close I

00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:28,240
wanted to bring up a test for

00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:31,540
blamelessness of that incident we talked

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,670
about you might start and just say that

00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:36,910
a script is executed and deleted the

00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:41,140
production database right that's that

00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:42,970
seems fine but interesting enough that's

00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:44,410
kind of passive and someone had to run

00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:45,820
the script it likely didn't run itself

00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:47,020
and so in an environment where you want

00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,570
to make the script run itself is

00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:51,520
probably kind of blame 'full maybe we

00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:53,650
get to the next place an engineer on the

00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,790
team executed this script this is pretty

00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,450
good I mean at least you're saying

00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:57,370
someone did it

00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:59,140
you are hiding information about who

00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:00,760
they are but in some environments that

00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,590
might be good right if you don't think

00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,300
that broader than your team is going to

00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:06,010
feel this way you might not want you to

00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:07,169
put someone's name all on sorts of docks

00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,970
that get distributed

00:29:07,169 --> 00:29:12,249
but if you can manage to have a truly

00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:13,840
blameless culture you could say that

00:29:12,249 --> 00:29:16,269
Chris executed a script that deleted the

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,679
production database now didn't we talked

00:29:16,269 --> 00:29:19,059
about was me because I'm the only person

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,570
on my team that's ever in the office

00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:24,820
that early in the morning and I did it

00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:26,440
by accident we had a hundred branches

00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,789
that were stale and our github pages

00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,259
Brants that it was stale too because we

00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:32,499
hadn't released the documentation in a

00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:33,669
bit and I deleted it but I didn't have

00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:35,080
to worry about saying that because no

00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:38,519
one on my team was going to look at me

00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,519
and say why do you work here okay

00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:54,279
someone is thinking this right now

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,350
there's a quote from an economist I like

00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:57,789
a lot that says if you've never missed a

00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:00,249
flight you're probably spending entirely

00:29:57,789 --> 00:30:02,169
too much time in an airport if you're

00:30:00,249 --> 00:30:06,369
never failing you're probably not trying

00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:09,070
very hard you know you can do you can

00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:11,169
break your own stuff this is really fun

00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:12,580
if you haven't done this do this I'm not

00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:15,039
going to go into a talk about creating

00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:18,309
chaos monkeys but you should definitely

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:19,960
look into it the other thing is your SLA

00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:22,029
might be too low if you're not breaking

00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,240
yourself just throw some nines on there

00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:26,440
you'll you'll have some new problems so

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,809
thank you all it was great to talk to

00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:32,049
you about this I will take questions in

00:30:28,809 --> 00:30:34,980
the hallway or at lunch as lightning

00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:34,980
talks maybe start a next door

00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:45,180
[Applause]

00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:45,180
