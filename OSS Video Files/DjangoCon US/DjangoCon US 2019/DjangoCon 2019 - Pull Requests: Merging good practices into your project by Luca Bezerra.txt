	DjangoCon 2019 - Pull Requests: Merging good practices into your project by Luca Bezerra

On average, developers spend 45% of their time fixing bugs and technical debt, instead of developing new features, had those bugs been caught during code review. The attendees will learn tips, tools, processes and recommended practices from my experience and from big players (Django, Facebook, etc).
