[Music]

00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:21,740
good morning everybody

00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:23,029
how are you all feeling today for those

00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,500
of you watching the video later I

00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:29,960
specifically asked for the hangover

00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:33,199
keynote everybody here looks like young

00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,699
and fresh and beautiful and alert but I

00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:36,290
like this speaking slot coz folks tend

00:00:34,699 --> 00:00:37,370
to be just a little more compliant if

00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:44,720
you tell like hey raise your hand

00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:46,250
they're like yes make it stop uhh so my

00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,659
name is Jessica rose and I've had a

00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,549
really really great intro and I'm

00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:51,650
absolutely delighted to be here with you

00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:53,629
all today I'm based in the United

00:00:51,650 --> 00:01:00,409
Kingdom right now where everything is

00:00:53,629 --> 00:01:01,670
just fine thank you for asking for folks

00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:03,710
he may be watching the video much much

00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:08,840
later this is it's in September it's

00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:10,369
2019 it was it was a weird year and I do

00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,229
I head up the Mozilla Tech speaker

00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:15,439
program and this is a program that

00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:17,420
empowers and supports technical speakers

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,700
who apply for it and that sounds really

00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:22,880
fluffy empowers and supports sounds very

00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,710
much like a sham charity but what we

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,140
actually do is that folks who apply to

00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,670
this program and who are accepted get

00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,619
five weeks of remote speaker training

00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:32,450
and then when they speak about something

00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:34,789
that overlaps with musicians Mozilla's

00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:37,789
mission we help cover travel and hotel

00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:40,729
for them the applications for this

00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:44,090
aren't open yet but I'm reasonably sure

00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:46,429
they'll open in November and you might

00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,780
say hey Jess because its first thing in

00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:50,210
the morning you've laughed at one of my

00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,770
jokes we're on a first-name basis you

00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:54,409
say Jess why are we even talking about

00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,640
burnout at a technology conference we've

00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:57,560
just heard about contributing to the

00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,939
Django project which is fantastic we're

00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,060
gonna be talking about some really

00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:05,960
exciting technically hard-hitting things

00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:08,240
why specifically burnout and why now and

00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,500
I'd say my argument is gonna be that

00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,780
you're not gonna be able to do cool

00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,640
things while you're burned out and this

00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,740
may sound like hey you're not gonna be

00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:22,510
able to do more productive work to

00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:22,510
support capitalism and that's true

00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:29,480
but I'm of course I would like for you

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,270
to all to continue to get paid to afford

00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:40,190
food and medical care because that costs

00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:41,660
money here oh sorry we we've got the NHS

00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:45,860
for like six more months I shouldn't be

00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,960
smug um yes you won't be able to do good

00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:52,580
work but you won't be able to like enjoy

00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:53,990
your lives I'd love for all of you if

00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,400
you take it well I'll give you something

00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:57,560
else at the end but like you're more

00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,510
than just your work I hope I'm not

00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,370
seeing any stony-faced managers so I

00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:05,450
think we're good and your quality of

00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:07,550
life genuinely matters before I got into

00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:10,610
technology I worked as a teacher and I

00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,890
am so dazzlingly excited by the human

00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:15,020
brain not the mine necessarily but just

00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:17,030
your brain is a construct it is like a

00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,680
little knot that your brain is little

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,520
tiny like everyone's brains are smaller

00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,520
than you would hope not

00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:31,209
what's your brain as everyone else's

00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:34,310
it's just a little tiny wet bag of meat

00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:36,560
drenched in chemicals and this gives you

00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,239
everything you've ever been afraid of

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,160
everything you've ever loved everything

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,410
that you're worried about right now

00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,880
that's just your brain being extremely

00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:48,530
weird and cool and your brain is so not

00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,590
but your brain is so small but like

00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:54,160
one's brain is relatively small and much

00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:56,269
more delicate than you think it is

00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,920
before we get started I'm going to talk

00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,600
to you very very briefly about cognitive

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,570
psychology has anybody ever heard of

00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:05,090
this before oh this is like my audience

00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,590
for nerds fantastic for those of you

00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,480
watching on the video everybody liked it

00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,730
a triumphant fist pump into the sky

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,350
they're not miked but several people

00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,350
yelled cognitive psychology keywords

00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:19,190
so I'm going to talk about two main

00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:21,289
concepts in cognitive psychology which

00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,810
was very popular back in the sort of 60s

00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:25,729
and it was sort of a new field of

00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:29,090
looking at the human brain and the human

00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:30,889
mind as though it was a computer so

00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,030
these sort of computationally aligned

00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:32,690
processes are gonna sound pretty

00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:36,320
familiar

00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:39,590
so working memory is just how much

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,810
capacity your mind your brain has for

00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,310
running processes right now and that

00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,520
right now is really important because

00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:48,860
that changes where as cognitive load is

00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,690
the total amount of mental effort being

00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:54,530
used now how much of that working memory

00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:56,930
you have available right right now and

00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:59,090
that changes you're not born day one and

00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,130
you have a perfect vessel of all the

00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:03,889
working memory you're gonna have your

00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:06,139
working memory changes depending on how

00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:10,130
young you are like kids are not that

00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:12,500
smart if your kid is really smart

00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:14,090
I I'm sure they're doing really good at

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,289
spelling like your personal child

00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,289
brilliant but other people's kids

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,750
there's a lot of parents in the crowd um

00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:25,190
but the amount of working memory you

00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,169
have doesn't just change on how old you

00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:31,099
are it's gonna change day to day Howard

00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:33,139
our let's say you went to bed at 10:00

00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:34,729
you got 9 hours of sleep you had a

00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:37,039
really healthy breakfast when you went

00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:39,050
running we've got three different sizes

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,960
of beaker you might be that giant beaker

00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:43,490
up there I gave this talking a hangover

00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,199
keynote once and when I got to the like

00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:48,260
nine hours of sleep somebody went whew

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:52,340
at the back every other face turned

00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:54,800
around in anger but maybe let's say you

00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,139
didn't get nine hours of sleep I need a

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,909
salad for breakfast maybe you're out by

00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:01,250
the pool drinking whatever local

00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:02,900
cocktail people drink and you're feeling

00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,000
a bit delicate today you might be a

00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,530
little tiny beaker in them would not you

00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,639
would never be the tiny beaker you would

00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:12,169
clearly be the slightly smaller beaker

00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,699
and that's really really interesting cuz

00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:18,259
we have a different amount of memory as

00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:21,099
it goes I've got sort of a weird demo

00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:21,099
for working memory

00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,850
so let's say I am a small plastic cup

00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:31,870
today this is all I've got to work with

00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:35,410
I say well I'm giving a keynote right

00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:38,410
now which is fine that's that's a

00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:41,230
reasonable about of my working memory

00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:43,480
taken up by this cognitive load and I

00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:48,790
have just now wondered whether or not I

00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:52,090
filed my British taxes and that's super

00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:57,330
fine I have like nine emails that are

00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:59,590
all marked critical and I'm running a

00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:06,760
50-person event in Amsterdam

00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:08,470
oh good like tomorrow that's oh no so as

00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,330
you go all of these processes all of

00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,630
your multi-threaded thinking is taking

00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:15,730
up more and more of the working memory

00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:17,110
that you have available for this day the

00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,820
first time I gave this talk I went ahead

00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,800
and did a full demo and overflowed this

00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:24,220
onto the stage and I have been told to

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,870
never do that again so for the sake of

00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:30,340
everyone following me we'll just imagine

00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:31,780
I made an absolute god-awful mess I also

00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:39,310
did this with champagne once which was

00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:40,720
fantastic yes okay we've got the major

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,580
keywords here we've got like working

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,710
memory how much how big your plastic cup

00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:47,140
is today

00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,610
and then you've got cognitive load how

00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,950
much of that you filled with coffee or

00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:52,090
champagne as you do and we're going to

00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,630
be talking about the core of what we're

00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,360
looking at today

00:07:52,630 --> 00:08:00,270
occupational burnout everybody bay ready

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:02,770
to be really excited cuz this sucks

00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:04,510
occupational burnout isn't new we've

00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:06,070
been doing this for as long as we've

00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:10,630
been grinding people to dust through

00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:15,150
their work occupational burnout a weird

00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:17,800
small laugh ha ha ha human misery

00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,630
occupational burn if you don't wood

00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,120
technique people say just and I don't

00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:26,500
mean just occupational burnout is just

00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:29,700
exhausting just it is physical mental

00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:32,110
and emotional exhaustion that feels

00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:34,539
inescapable and it's been going on for a

00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,030
protracted period of time it is the

00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:37,880
result

00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:40,070
long term and your mileage may vary from

00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,190
long-term some people can go ahead and

00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:46,250
soldier through that four years which is

00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:49,580
great I guess and some people it could

00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:52,100
be weeks or months and the most exciting

00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:55,730
thing just the best best thing about

00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:57,860
burnout is it can both cause exacerbate

00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:02,860
and nearer the symptoms of serious

00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:06,290
physical and mental illnesses yeah yeah

00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:08,240
you say okay that's great just that's

00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:10,780
exactly what I wanted ten in the morning

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,520
good for you

00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:15,680
how about we go ahead and look at what

00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,120
detecting burnout might be like and this

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,340
is kind of a personal thing this is like

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,810
hey let's do it's it's not a

00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,970
psychological concept but

00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:25,340
psychologically aligned so I'm not gonna

00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:30,290
say hey raise your hand if you're no no

00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:34,130
wait um how about could you just go

00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:37,040
ahead and give me a like stony really

00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:38,360
done with everything look if any of

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:44,900
these are relevant and go ahead and keep

00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:47,810
count to yourself hey hey hey are you a

00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:50,570
little bit over people like you're just

00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:52,850
kind of done with people either at work

00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:57,260
or in your personal life maybe both

00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:59,630
I always think this one's a plant

00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,520
because this is everyone except for that

00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:04,610
one guy who'd got 9 hours of sleep and

00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,440
ate a salad for breakfast are you just

00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,240
getting up in the morning dragging

00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,650
yourself through work and then having

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,120
the toughest time engaging with the

00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:16,610
stuff once you're there are you real

00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,170
real done with people maybe irritable

00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:20,540
with your co-workers maybe irritable

00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:25,220
with customers really done with your

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:26,510
clients I really don't like this

00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,150
question because we're back on sort of

00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:30,800
the delayed capitalism thing but like do

00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:32,840
you like the energy to consistently

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:38,960
produce for the people who own your

00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:40,640
labor hmm are you not having a super fun

00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,440
time are you not being able to see

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,670
yourself in your own successes you get

00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,760
something done and it's just a bit like

00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:50,380
Oh

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:52,000
the next then I'm really excited because

00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:54,070
earlier today I learned that somebody

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,220
quit their job immediately after the

00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,730
last time I gave this talk please come

00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,800
see me

00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:01,360
after this if you do but like are you

00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,870
kind of disillusioned about your job

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,410
you're like wow we make blue widgets

00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,410
that's great

00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:13,960
are you using food drugs or alcohol to

00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:18,760
sort of coast through to feel better or

00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:22,150
to feel less have your sleep habits or

00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,740
your appetites changed I think this

00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:26,140
one's just part of getting old but like

00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:29,350
the stuff hurt where it didn't use to

00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:34,840
hurt I love this because there's always

00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:37,510
20 year old was like Wyatt fantastic

00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,650
news very very exciting these survey

00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:41,980
questions are actually from the Mayo

00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:43,480
Clinic diagnostic survey on burnout and

00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,690
you might be saying oh you know I only

00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:49,050
got four of those I am kind of tired of

00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:52,210
people and blue widgets are okay I guess

00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:55,860
you're gonna be so excited to learn that

00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,860
if you've answered yes to one or more

00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:02,260
for folks walking on the video I'm not

00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:05,430
laughing at my own jokes but somebody

00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:08,820
just let a very nervous small laugh

00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:11,530
probably a sign that everything's fine

00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:13,240
music Jess thank you so much for

00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,680
bringing this water these are more and I

00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,350
may be suffering from occupational

00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:21,850
burnout what a gift you're welcome

00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:24,250
let me talk a little bit about recovery

00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:27,040
and the first thing I'm gonna go ahead

00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:29,050
and do is sort of very very bold warning

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,990
I didn't do this in red but imagine it's

00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:34,930
red I am NOT your doctor I am NOT a

00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:37,180
doctor I would probably tell you to walk

00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:39,700
off any kind of major ailment I don't

00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:42,430
know what I'm doing please if you fought

00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:44,830
feel that you're being impacted even by

00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:46,840
burnout or by a by a mental or physical

00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,180
ailment please immediately talk to a

00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,650
real doctor I would just fill your

00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,980
pockets with candy and tell you to have

00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:56,080
a nice day the one thing I'd warn you is

00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,840
that recovering from burnout is going to

00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,390
take a real

00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:01,550
long time longer than you think it is I

00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:05,270
wound up very profoundly burned out

00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:06,530
maybe in 2016 which has just occurred to

00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:10,580
me that was a very long time ago and

00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:12,440
that's fine I'm mostly okay these days

00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,240
recovering from burnout is gonna take

00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,840
you longer than you think it will I'm

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,180
sorry

00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,470
and from here we've got two different

00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,170
routes sort of two different recovery

00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:23,990
routes if you're the type of person who

00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:29,150
can afford to take a really significant

00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:30,920
time off of work you're set like I don't

00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:33,700
know what rich people do like spend some

00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,780
more time with your horses or your boats

00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,370
but you're gonna be like if you can

00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:39,830
afford to take a big chunk of time off

00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:41,270
of work please take that time back and

00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:46,220
do whatever rich people do with their

00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:50,780
time I genuinely don't know like car's

00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:53,660
loud cars but for those of us who can't

00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:57,140
load our horse onto a boat for a year or

00:13:53,660 --> 00:14:01,430
more of down time I also don't know

00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:03,880
about horses or boats if you can't stop

00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:05,690
doing the things that are breaking you

00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,300
here are some things that might be

00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:10,490
helpful do less in ways that aren't

00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,260
going to destroy your life and I think

00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:15,140
if this sort of as emotional energy

00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:18,740
triage if you like projects I can't stop

00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:20,120
you from making a Trello board go ahead

00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:23,300
and list out all the things you have to

00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:25,400
do and rank those by like what is going

00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:28,640
to destroy you probably need to continue

00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:30,650
to pay your taxes I'm like for those

00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,410
based in the US please continue to pay

00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:36,680
your health insurance probably continue

00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:38,600
to show up at your job but like look at

00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,980
the things where if they don't get done

00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,170
now or they don't get done in the next

00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,820
six months leave those alone you

00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,680
probably don't have to paint your house

00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:48,020
right now you don't have to mow your

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,930
lawn until your neighbors complain a lot

00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,700
of these things a lot of homeowners a

00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:54,380
lot of these things are just gonna be

00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,120
fine if you leave them make sure that

00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:59,660
you're really selectively investing in

00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,940
these absolutely outsourced where you

00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:05,240
can if you've got a little bit of extra

00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:07,850
cash but not like horses on a boat money

00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,529
um see what you can go ahead and

00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:12,589
outsource either professionally or

00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:14,480
through bonds of human emotion when I

00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:16,640
wound up really really burned out my

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,410
beloved husband who isn't here so I

00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,589
guess I I don't have to say nice things

00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:24,440
about him did all of the holiday

00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:26,390
shopping one year I get people who are

00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,279
there to support you not an exploited if

00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:30,110
not in a terrible way to help you a

00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:32,260
little bit more either through fairly

00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,950
compensating them for their labor or

00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,390
hopefully through the human

00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,950
relationships you've carefully built up

00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:40,550
and will not torch while you're burned

00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:46,010
out this one's my favorite one can I get

00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:48,620
everybody just a yell no 1 2 3 start

00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,760
saying no and I always chat to somebody

00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,760
after this to be like oh you know I'm

00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,839
really burned out or it's like yo yo but

00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,339
I've got all these different things and

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,850
I can't say no to any of them or it's

00:15:55,339 --> 00:16:00,500
like no no and as I find folks who

00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,899
organize things and care for their

00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,100
people and and do community work tend to

00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:05,740
have the hardest problem with this

00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:09,320
whereas like hey say no they're like no

00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:12,649
everything will fall apart I go ahead

00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:15,200
and warn you that warned you I gently

00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:16,850
encourage you and if you continue to

00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,750
stay burned out if you continue to do

00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,810
too much

00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:23,839
eventually most people are going to hit

00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:25,730
a wall where something not great happens

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,350
this could be a health crisis this could

00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,390
be a mental health crisis this could

00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:31,670
just be doing a table flip in the middle

00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:34,100
of the office if you keep pushing for

00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:36,110
too long something not great is gonna

00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,480
happen and then you're not going to be

00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,880
able to help anyone by taking care of

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,649
yourself and by taking this time back if

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,870
you're very civic-minded and you want to

00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:46,820
help other people I'd strongly encourage

00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:49,370
you to sort of put on your own air mask

00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,930
before helping other people if the only

00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:53,630
way I can guilt you into taking a break

00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:55,420
is by saying wow you won't be able to

00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,810
help anybody if you break yourself

00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:01,640
that's weird

00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:04,100
see me after class but that's true and

00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:06,439
this one's absolutely my thing I can

00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,929
have two favorites I love the saying no

00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:11,740
it's fantastic so hey you want to help

00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:11,740
me move this weekend

00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:18,250
oh gosh we're going into town can you

00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:20,709
dog sit and the cool thing is you don't

00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:22,959
even need a special excuse if I can give

00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:25,209
you a one-size catch-all it's that's not

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:29,610
really gonna work for me that sounds

00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:29,610
soft and gentle and that's a hard no

00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:38,440
it's alright I also quite like selective

00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:40,360
emotional investment and based on the

00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,679
booms and ahhs where I said like kids

00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,630
aren't that smart I'm guessing there's a

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,340
lot of parents here

00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:51,309
does anybody know about like mom swears

00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:53,679
cool mom swears are where someone's very

00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:56,950
intentionally saying something but you

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,450
get a heck instead and one thing I'd

00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:01,230
really love to you walk away with is

00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:04,690
you've only got so many hex in your life

00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:07,900
like pick em up count em say well I got

00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:15,490
six of these hex and somebody's wrong on

00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:17,260
the internet but I got six and people

00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:19,809
are definitely gonna be wrong in real

00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:22,900
life I'm gonna hold on to B's

00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:24,850
so really count the amount of emotional

00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,400
energy the amount of engagement sounds

00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,990
of Faerie BuzzFeed II the amount of

00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,850
energy you have for these interactions

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,860
and only pass them out where they're

00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:34,059
really important you say oh I've

00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:37,600
actually really burned out I'm really -

00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:39,040
I have exactly three hex and I am not

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,080
delivering them for this foolishness you

00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:44,440
have a nice day on out they can be wrong

00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:46,540
by themselves and one thing I'd really

00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,280
love to encourage you to do I really see

00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:51,460
people having a problem with is ask for

00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:53,260
help so hey I'm tired I can't do this I

00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,340
need a break I need a couple days off

00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:59,890
after this conference

00:18:54,340 --> 00:19:01,030
everybody conference take ask for help

00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:04,000
and ask for support where it's

00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:06,220
appropriate and I'd really love to bully

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,419
people to recharge if you do have time

00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,900
to take that big chunk of time off

00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:13,750
fantastic if you don't I'd love to

00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,320
gently lovingly bully you on the

00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,419
weekends

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,169
sign out of everything you can sign out

00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:23,090
of take some time and do the stuff that

00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:25,100
makes you feel connected to things again

00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:27,680
it could be a needlessly complicated

00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:30,290
board game all right

00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:32,360
oh this board games die isn't there Oh

00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:33,890
for those watching the video there are

00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,360
no board games and there are no social

00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:41,990
events you've missed nothing and it's

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:43,670
rained all week Reid I I am firmly told

00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:46,370
that there are people who like exercise

00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:47,870
to recharge and if this is you again

00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:50,960
come see me after class because I would

00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:53,780
really like some tips on I guess lying

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,930
to myself to suggest I could ever be

00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:59,000
that kind of person one thing I'd really

00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:01,340
really love to encourage you is practice

00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,250
forgiveness when you're burned out

00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:06,200
you're not necessarily screwing more

00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:08,600
things up but you're more hyper aware of

00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,190
it people mess stuff up all the time and

00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,100
again not you personally the other

00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:15,050
people in your life clearly if you are

00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,450
burned out or even day to day practice a

00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:18,710
lot of forgiveness not all god I got up

00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:22,670
on stage and nobody laughed at that

00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:25,520
horse joke yeah it's gonna be it's

00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:27,440
probably statistically going to be okay

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,410
if you look at what's going on in your

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,450
life as long as you zoom in or out just

00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:35,090
the right amount everything's going to

00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:36,830
be mostly fine that's the most

00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:40,520
reassuring thing sounding thing I have

00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:42,110
that means nothing just go easy on

00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,870
yourself especially while you're getting

00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:47,270
better and this is a really big one when

00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:49,070
I see people like super burned out and

00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:51,200
the way I see them really trashed their

00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:55,400
lives is you lash out you're like I'm

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:58,010
tired I mean somebody's gonna pay don't

00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,050
do that you're it's just a crappy thing

00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:02,120
to do but it's also going to make your

00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,590
life much worse even if you don't like

00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,870
other people or don't like other people

00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:08,210
right now being a jerk doesn't help you

00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:10,930
either but naturally this is Jango Khan

00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:13,970
and everybody's a lovely person right

00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:18,740
whoo all right that was a very delayed

00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:22,990
hard maybe like yeah so just as a quick

00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:26,290
recap to sort of recover from burnout

00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,290
everything's fine

00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:35,309
I'll just describe the slides as we go

00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:37,289
to recover from burnout being circle

00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:39,539
that says do less you're gonna need to

00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:41,580
do quite a bit less you're gonna need to

00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:43,950
dramatically reduce your stressors

00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:46,070
wherever possible and you're gonna need

00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:49,890
to go ahead and invest that energy

00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:53,549
selectively hey I've got four hex and

00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:57,809
you don't get one today good day you say

00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:59,010
oh but yes you know you're you're

00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:00,899
talking to me about burnout and you're

00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:02,789
giving me a lot of like things I can do

00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:05,909
as an individuals yeah yeah that's a wad

00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:06,929
yes if a lot of this is Occupational

00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:08,970
burnout if people are getting burned it

00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:10,860
out on their jobs these into my bosses

00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:12,240
or their bosses job to make sure that

00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:25,190
they're not destroying me and not

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:27,630
destroying us and yeah yes yes but I

00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:30,059
think waiting for someone else to take

00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:31,950
that responsibility to manage people in

00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:35,190
an ethical fashion or to balance your

00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:36,419
work-life balance for you may not be

00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:38,130
something we can look forward to

00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:43,770
wholesale in 2019

00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:45,750
it's absolutely their jobs but that

00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:47,760
should is highlighted for a reason

00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,140
employees managers investors another

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:53,130
decision because they absolutely should

00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:54,390
be making an effort to treat you in a

00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,590
way that's sustainable and that's not

00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:57,149
going to burn you out and they won't

00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:02,630
replace you with somebody else in 18

00:22:57,149 --> 00:23:02,630
months but should is a real tricky word

00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:09,210
so far this has been a really light

00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:12,830
fluffy keynote right I want to take you

00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:15,690
on a little tiny detour but maybe

00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:18,779
there's a couple parts of burnout or the

00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:26,100
recovery process that might actually not

00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:28,320
be entirely rubbish and I was at an

00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:31,500
event recently and I had an interaction

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:33,290
that was great it was so much fun it was

00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,380
the best interaction

00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:38,330
I had made a polite excuse er it's like

00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:40,670
oh hey this is all really fun but I'm

00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:43,420
I'm a little bit burned out I'm gonna go

00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:46,700
away now

00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:48,440
but at this recent event somebody hadn't

00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,330
even a just came up to me and said yes

00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,090
cuz we were also on that first-name

00:23:50,330 --> 00:24:05,510
basis like yes oh my god how are you I

00:23:53,090 --> 00:24:07,270
didn't know you were pregnant so if I

00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:09,620
can give you a gift

00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:14,690
well first I'll never do that but that's

00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:17,120
you you knew that from being a teacher

00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:19,430
there's like a hard three-second stare

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,370
that can lead anyone to question their

00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:23,330
life in their life choices so jess I

00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:35,060
didn't know you were pregnant

00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:36,950
oh I'm not I blessed this gentleman's

00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:46,370
little cotton socks his tiny cotton

00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:47,870
socks he's like oh but you know and you

00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:50,150
can double up that three second look you

00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:52,430
can go six seconds but you've got a

00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:53,420
commit you've gotta like not be able to

00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:56,720
blink for a sec so you've got to be

00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:58,220
ready to go and before burnout I like

00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,690
would have taken this as the worst day

00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:03,380
of the world like a I would have to do a

00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:07,010
murder it's it's manslaughter it's fine

00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:11,210
and I also would have doubted myself Oh

00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:12,830
God uh I mean maybe I'm getting older

00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:15,440
maybe you think I'm getting ready to

00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:17,450
have kids and like maybe maybe I put on

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,400
some weight or like is it this dress it

00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:21,840
is not this dress this dress has pockets

00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:25,830
this dress is great

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:30,030
I could very easily see pre burnout me

00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:34,640
spending maybe a night maybe weird 3

00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:36,150
a.m. moments for the next 60 year Oh 40

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,440
40 years

00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,530
popping awake at night to think about

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,390
this by it

00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:49,440
post burnout it's great for you're like

00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:51,570
oh you're a cuz I only packed

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,130
three hex that day and I used one of

00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:56,940
them to get out of the event like oh I'm

00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:58,590
tired and I hate this good day and it

00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:02,820
would have cost at least six to do a

00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:04,800
murder there was nothing in my immediate

00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:07,290
vicinity I had like a notebook and a

00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:11,280
phone and it's not a clue episode you

00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:15,180
can't do a lot with those but like post

00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:18,030
burnout I had this much energy which was

00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:19,550
just enough to put this in a talk where

00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:23,760
eventually this guy is gonna see this

00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:25,770
and he gets to think about it at 3 in

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:29,550
the morning for the next hold is he I

00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:30,630
mean hopefully not that many years no

00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:36,420
he's he's fine

00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:40,410
I he's I left him alive so if nothing

00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:43,890
else your brains are not your asset

00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:47,730
everybody's brain is small and gentle

00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:50,610
and easy to break but remarkably

00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:52,820
resilient and things as long as you zoom

00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:55,830
in or out just the right amount are

00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:57,590
probably going to be mostly fine thank

00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:03,230
you so much

00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:16,539
[Applause]

00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:16,539
