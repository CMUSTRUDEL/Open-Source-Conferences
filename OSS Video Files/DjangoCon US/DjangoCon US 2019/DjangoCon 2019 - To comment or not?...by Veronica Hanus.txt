Description: 
	DjangoCon 2019 - To comment or not? A data-driven look at attitudes toward code comments by Veronica Hanus

How can someone who is just learning find the commenting style that is best for them as they learn, grow, & contribute? I did a survey of programmers & will be sharing what we can do to address comment use in a way that encourages a growth mindset and empowers everyone.

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,450
how's everybody doing I see you're still

00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:25,250
here so we're gonna call it successful

00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:27,050
yes is that how speaking works I'm

00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,500
wondering how many of you have made a

00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:32,809
comment to yourselves as you were like

00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,699
within the code itself you said oh I

00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:36,920
need to make a comment here this is a

00:00:34,699 --> 00:00:39,620
little note to myself I see a few hands

00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,910
and then some shy hands I suspect when

00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:45,589
we get more comfortable there will be a

00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:46,940
lot more hands thank you all so you may

00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:48,589
have done that for a bunch of different

00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,750
reasons there may have been a variable

00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:53,269
that you were scared to change you could

00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,850
have say copy pasted some section of

00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:57,850
code from Stack Overflow and wanted to

00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:01,970
make a quick note about what it did I

00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:04,460
see a few grimaces that's my every day

00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,720
as well and you or you may have made a

00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:08,510
choice that you wanted to be able to

00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,700
explain to your future selves because

00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:13,850
it's easy to forget why you wrote what

00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:16,850
you wrote but I'm wondering when you

00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:20,299
made that last comment did you think

00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:22,700
that you are making documentation so

00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:25,670
documentation is what allows us our code

00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,140
to be used expanded and adapted and for

00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,350
community to be formed around the

00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:32,780
software we create so when you last rode

00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:35,270
that comment to your code why did you do

00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:38,590
it you been making a note about

00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:41,179
something that was unclear and in

00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:46,429
essence that's when we go to

00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:50,090
documentation so so it makes sense that

00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:52,189
the comments that we make now may end up

00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,880
being the guiding our documentation

00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:57,999
later

00:01:52,880 --> 00:02:00,859
and as this comic perfectly illustrates

00:01:57,999 --> 00:02:04,310
documentation can cause or relieve

00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:10,280
programmer pain you don't want to be

00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:12,410
this reptile so comments as Doc's often

00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,060
different benefits offer different

00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,130
benefits than long for breeding means

00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,780
that we think of as documentation they

00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,750
can summarize the purpose of a

00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,370
particular file which our user can be

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,280
really useful to folks doing a deep dive

00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,310
into a new code

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,020
basse describe functions in place give

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,630
the why for a decision and lower

00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,920
cognitive load with all these reasons to

00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,620
use inline comments you may think that

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,760
we'd be using them everywhere but what's

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:42,300
the problem with that these things are

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,670
all true while testing if we are using

00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,920
it can point us to possibly outdated

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,750
function Street strings there's nothing

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,420
that I can that I found that will help

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,700
us keep our inline comments to date so

00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:59,700
too many comments does in fact point to

00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:03,840
unclear code in something that we forget

00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:06,959
about that refactoring comments that's

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:12,200
up there a comment to our little stick

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,200
figure man about refactoring is that

00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:19,620
we're factoring happens often when you

00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,620
know as something that you need to do

00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:26,670
hurriedly before you you know finish

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:29,130
your PR or and often is pushed aside and

00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:31,260
so that you can do new work instead so

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:35,820
if you don't have time for Pete feedback

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:38,970
like built-in to your to your workflow

00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,829
you may end up feeling that that the

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,230
important time spent refactoring is a

00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:45,450
nice to have so you end up refactoring

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,760
when you can't stand any more or the

00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:51,260
problem has grown to be so large that it

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,260
must be taken care of right now

00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,650
so if you find that refactoring has

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,530
pushed the backburner again and again

00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,970
you may have to work yourself up to

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,970
wrapping your head around what has

00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,950
become very old code so when you can

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,230
refactor you might have to put yourself

00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,519
in a good mood go to your favorite room

00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,370
in the house play your favorite

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:15,019
concentration music softly and draw

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,019
yourself a relaxing bath

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:26,100
I'm glad you all appreciated that so you

00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:28,229
know this this refactoring step which we

00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,289
which we know is important even as

00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:34,080
experienced developers we often aren't

00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:37,650
in a position to make time for the way

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:42,630
we should and newer developers have even

00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:44,729
less ability to take that step in this

00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:47,849
comment take comic takes on a lot more

00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:50,660
nuance if we consider those rotten

00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:53,759
comments that were always worried about

00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:55,500
so the message is no longer hey Doc's

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,370
are important in their what we build

00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:01,560
community on but it's also you know

00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:05,599
having that outdated comment that we

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:08,250
didn't take care of is going to mislead

00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:09,900
and in fact there have been real losses

00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,479
that could be avoided by a well-placed

00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:16,169
inline comment in my research I was told

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:19,410
about an incredible loss of data due to

00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:22,110
a developer changing a value unknowingly

00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:24,300
and you know that leaves me wondering

00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:31,259
could a clarifying comment have saved

00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:33,419
the day and if we think about our newer

00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:35,009
devs the devs who may be using their

00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:37,080
inline comments as a form of

00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:38,759
documentation we see that we're sending

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,150
a very confusing message

00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:44,400
we're telling folks that they need to

00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:46,919
keep their code dry not repeat

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,699
themselves but also that undocumented

00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:52,770
code is unusable and when your forms of

00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,810
documenting are limited that that really

00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,940
puts you in a you know how am I going to

00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:58,740
find the right commenting style I want

00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:05,940
to do things the right way but what is

00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:11,340
that so we're going to look at some

00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:15,659
comments some dirty terrible filthy code

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:18,900
and it's dirty terrible filthy comments

00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:22,430
so we'll have a little fun in my expense

00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,430
let's see what happens

00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,880
so in this first example I had used a

00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:32,390
tutorial to kind of kickstart this

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,850
project and I thought you know I'm a

00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:37,130
scientist I should be citing all my

00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:40,100
sources and I put that tutorial right at

00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:42,890
the top how do we all feel about this

00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:45,230
was this like an OK comment to have

00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:47,180
within my code and it gets to stay I see

00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:49,490
one thumb up do we get some thumbs down

00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,620
I see some thumbs down okay

00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,210
there's some disagreement but a whole

00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:58,190
bunch of quiet people can we try that

00:06:53,210 --> 00:07:01,460
one more time alright hands up if you

00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:04,490
think this is an OK way to use inline

00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:06,830
commenting I see a bunch of hands hands

00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,480
down hands up if you think this is not

00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,970
OK please don't do this ever again

00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,470
Veronica for those of you with your

00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:20,270
hands up right now I'm about to show you

00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:21,740
something even more disgusting alright

00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:24,020
so this was my first time using

00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:28,010
beautiful scoop it soup and I was using

00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:30,500
it to scrape this website and show me

00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:33,380
whether my favorite student-organized

00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:36,740
climbing wall would be available during

00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,450
my lunch break so you know a student

00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,600
would come and it was kind of hit or

00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:44,780
miss because students so it would they

00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,520
would come and you know update their app

00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,100
website thing whatever they were using

00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:52,270
and often I would miss these climbing

00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:54,890
wall hours because I hadn't checked my

00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:59,630
check the website right then so I was

00:07:54,890 --> 00:08:03,470
going to make myself a scraper it was my

00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:08,450
first time using beautifulsoup I did not

00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:11,650
know what was happening so I made

00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:16,220
comments about what I needed to do I

00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:18,440
found I'm brought some non-working code

00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,870
decided that should be commented out in

00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:25,850
case it would be closer to correct than

00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:31,070
the code that I would write next and and

00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:39,710
I wrote my favorite comment of all time

00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:41,540
oh it's a list thank God does I assume

00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,190
everyone who's giggling has written a

00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:46,040
similar comment in their life that makes

00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:48,410
me feel a little better and the

00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,330
difficulty with all this is is we can

00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,920
all agree that if we saw a codebase and

00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:55,340
we're thinking of contributing that

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:59,840
looked like this we would run out that

00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:01,430
door right um so I can I feel confused

00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,900
looking at this just now it actually

00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,490
took me a moment when I looked at this

00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:09,560
slide to be like ooh what was I going to

00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:13,040
say here there's too much going on and I

00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:16,580
think I'm going to skip that and say

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,830
that we have so there's some things that

00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:24,680
we can agree on when it comes to what

00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:26,450
makes a comment useful and you know what

00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:30,170
are some best practices that we can get

00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:33,200
behind versus not so I'll give you guys

00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:37,910
a moment stock strings we usually like

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:42,530
those right outdated comments bad news

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:46,640
and my favorite too much is too much I

00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:48,320
don't know what that means still so

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,180
there's a lot of variation in what we

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,850
consider best practices for comments and

00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:54,800
the explanation is clearly enough clear

00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:56,510
enough there's different styles of

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,640
commenting people use different

00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:03,470
languages there's different standards

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:05,210
within companies or fields but we can

00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:09,490
all agree that comments if used properly

00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:12,710
can be an invaluable part of a code base

00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:14,980
but what is using a comment properly

00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,980
anyway

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:30,759
we may find that labeling our cats is

00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:31,779
actually really useful and of course

00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:34,870
when we find ourselves in these

00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:37,540
situations we go to the Internet and the

00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:39,370
Internet has some advice

00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:45,250
it has anyone else here seen a good

00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:48,519
stack overflows dry smackdown well okay

00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,990
I hear some people not seeing these dry

00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,000
smackdowns you need to go to stack

00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,589
overflow and you need to ask like when

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,149
is the best time to comment and you'll

00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:57,819
get a whole earful and it's really

00:10:55,149 --> 00:11:00,880
fantastic and we'll see some of that

00:10:57,819 --> 00:11:03,160
later my favorite comment because I went

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,290
out and I tried to find like well what

00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,649
is advice for when we have these

00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:17,290
comments that we shouldn't be using and

00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:18,600
my favorite piece of advice I'm still

00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:22,899
working on that

00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:24,550
and all this comes to me a cat it you

00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:26,620
know it kind of looks like you know

00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,540
they're telling you oh stop but they're

00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:32,589
not telling you what you need to be

00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:34,930
doing um and once I started seeing this

00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:38,350
attitude I started seeing it everywhere

00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:44,740
even in learning oriented beginner

00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:46,480
focused communities so and it wasn't

00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,040
until I started pairing with people who

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,509
were a lot more experienced than me that

00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,709
I that I realized that there's so much

00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:55,750
more nuance to what I then what I was

00:11:53,709 --> 00:12:03,730
experiencing you know sitting at home

00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:09,459
tapping along on you know being a person

00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:11,170
of the internet so when we asked um when

00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:13,870
our comments too much and when are they

00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:17,850
not enough you know we may ask a whole

00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:20,949
you know give ours give some background

00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:26,470
really helpful doing everything that we

00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:29,010
can and the response that we get looks a

00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,010
lot like this

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,150
and it's really important when we see

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,070
this kind of discussion there's always a

00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:40,620
grain of truth in the person telling you

00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:42,720
yes this may have been discussed to

00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,130
death and it may that be that there are

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,589
all these best practices that people are

00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:49,170
should be following but maybe they don't

00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:51,500
need to be following them right away do

00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:53,610
you all remember when you were new

00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,770
programmers and you first learned that

00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:59,430
you could put that nice little hash tag

00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:01,050
and the interpreter would just keep on

00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:06,350
rolling and you could write whatever you

00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:10,470
want it in there I see a couple of knots

00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:13,080
y'all are very shy I know it's fine but

00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:14,460
like that the truth is is these you know

00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,779
when you're first getting started and

00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,570
you realize you can do with these these

00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:21,839
comments are magic you're writing a

00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:24,000
secret note to yourself in your code the

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,150
thing that is confusing you you can make

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:33,030
an outline you can like explain what

00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:35,940
something means it's it's magic and I

00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:37,890
only saw a few heads nod saying that

00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:42,300
they remember that moment so the rest of

00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:45,690
you maybe like this and that's okay too

00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:49,020
but I want you to like come come back

00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:53,700
with us and like try to try to remember

00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:58,710
what that what that moment was like and

00:13:53,700 --> 00:14:00,290
I want to remind you that when newbies

00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:03,180
are learning how to program they're

00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:04,920
overwhelmed by trying to learn four or

00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:08,880
five six different things at once and

00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:11,880
you know Diane here says W I don't know

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,490
what the I've done tonight like I

00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,589
committed some stuff to get I did some

00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:20,040
things in JavaScript what's going on oh

00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:22,860
and this is this is where a lot of

00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,589
people are at and what happens if we

00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:30,510
tell this person that only clean comment

00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:32,250
free code is okay they're not able to do

00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:36,709
all these things that they may have been

00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:36,709
using commenting as an aid for

00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:45,800
and the more I thought about this the

00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:48,620
more I said okay we we need to address

00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,779
this you know where we tell people as

00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:53,870
they're more experienced that they need

00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:56,000
to be writing documentation but yet when

00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:58,160
they're first getting started we say

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,190
those things you might be using as your

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,620
first helpful Docs those are bad those

00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:09,980
mean you're bad programmer kay thanks

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:13,459
bye um so I asked Twitter and I'm

00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:15,260
extremely popular on Twitter so when I

00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:18,940
ask questions people answer and this

00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:23,330
time an entire nine people answered um

00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:25,580
and you know nine people you can't get a

00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:28,730
50/50 split but I got as close to a

00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:34,610
50-50 split as you could and it really

00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:37,130
appears that either some number of these

00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:39,050
nine people think that they've written

00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:43,520
dry code since the beginning of their

00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:45,529
days or they have very short memories

00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,350
and I see one person shaking their

00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:51,080
headaches nausea Stickley and I am you

00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:53,900
know encouraged by this a lot so I said

00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,970
so I said wait a minute first off nine

00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:58,100
people is terrible data and we can't do

00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,990
anything with that so I I made myself a

00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:03,860
real survey and started asking some real

00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:07,940
big kid questions um and we we're gonna

00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:09,650
look at those results now we're going to

00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,330
skip a few this slides because I spent

00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:15,800
too many times things too much time

00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:18,950
saying words earlier so I asking a

00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:21,529
series of questions that broadly were

00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:23,540
our comments helpful to you and are they

00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:26,510
helpful to you in a variety of ways like

00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:30,170
you know I asked comments can help me

00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:34,670
remember what my code does and ten is a

00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:37,130
strong agree and one is disagree this is

00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:39,950
a hundred and one hundred and

00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:43,010
sixty-seven folks responding so so

00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:49,000
pretty strong agreement and we move on

00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:49,000
and that's I mean I'm sorry about that

00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:59,089
so comments help me clarify my thinking

00:16:53,740 --> 00:17:01,460
we're in agreement again comments can

00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:04,069
save current and future developers time

00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:06,170
everyone's like hooray we all think this

00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:10,750
is true everyone in this room thinks

00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:15,920
this is true as well yes probably and

00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:19,220
then I asked comments are helpful to

00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:21,110
individual contributor bring building a

00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,510
project but should be deleted before the

00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:26,959
project is shared this is like how much

00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:28,459
shame do we feel in our comments it was

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,140
really the question I asked and I was

00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:31,760
really delighted as someone who had been

00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,260
told that you really should like remove

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,730
your comments before putting them to

00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,550
github if you want to ever be taken

00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:38,929
seriously like apparently I'm the only

00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:45,200
one to have that experience and that

00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:47,360
brought me so much joy and this and this

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,850
is something that a lot of people aren't

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,070
pointed to that function level comments

00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:55,010
those those docstrings those are okay

00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:58,400
but inline comments are clutter and the

00:17:55,010 --> 00:18:00,350
folks responding to my survey were you

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,390
know a little bit split but shifting

00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:04,520
more towards you know maybe inline

00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:06,440
comments are okay as well they're

00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,770
disagreeing with that and then here's

00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:13,130
here's the real moneymaker I said clear

00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:15,320
code is self documenting and doesn't

00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:17,780
need comments this is like what all our

00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,730
friends doing those Stack Overflow drive

00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:25,130
smackdowns I was talking about this is

00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:28,880
their line um and you remember how

00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:31,780
strong the you know comments are good

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:38,030
agrees were this has really spread out

00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:40,070
do you see this this is like there

00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:42,559
there's there's a whole lot of

00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:44,630
disagreement here and the thing that the

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,780
thing that the springs up for me is that

00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:49,940
means that as much as we all are likely

00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:55,090
to use inline comments and find them

00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:58,250
useful as as as folks have said earlier

00:18:55,090 --> 00:19:00,550
we've or some of us responding to this

00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:03,140
survey have really you know also

00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:04,310
internalize that your code should be

00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,380
self documenting

00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:09,790
and you shouldn't need these comments

00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,790
however we're all using them

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:18,860
I asked respondents for short answers as

00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:21,950
well and the thing that struck me I'm

00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:24,560
hoping to do you know more more analysis

00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:27,800
of these of these answers because people

00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,810
wrote me like whole tomes they described

00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,940
like what they had done at various

00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:34,940
stages of development and it was really

00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:37,820
neat because the the people who answered

00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:40,790
varied and experienced level from one

00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:43,040
month all the way to you know 30 odd

00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:45,530
years of programming so there's there

00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:53,480
was there's quite a quite a breadth of

00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:57,200
experience there so what what is the

00:19:53,480 --> 00:20:01,940
best use of comments we see our cat

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:04,640
again but you could also you know create

00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:08,540
whole man pages instead of having inline

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,440
comments my favorite use of comments in

00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,780
the whole world

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,820
some folks are creating ascii diagrams

00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,500
to like describe where their coat what

00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,600
their coat is doing you know if you have

00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:21,910
a complicated system it can be really

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,910
helpful to have a little you are here

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,500
and there's a generator linked at the

00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:30,230
bottom there if you if you want to use

00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:32,840
that and one thing that struck me when i

00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:37,400
was researching for for this talk is

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:41,570
that the idea that when we look at the

00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:44,210
our code it's more than just software it

00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:46,670
shows us like what problems we care

00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,420
about and like where we are as a

00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,070
community

00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:51,860
you know it shows us our shared

00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:53,900
understanding so if i had to say that in

00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:56,630
a like very tweetable sound bit i would

00:20:53,900 --> 00:21:00,140
say that comments really teach us about

00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:02,390
ourselves i show us what causes us

00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:05,000
confusion what needs to be documented

00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:08,360
and yes sometimes what needs to be

00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,810
refracted um so what can we do to

00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:15,130
support newer programmers as they're you

00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:18,630
know going from the magic of comments to

00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:23,140
developing more nuanced

00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:25,870
documentation strategies I really think

00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:27,610
the bottom line here is empathy being

00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:30,850
able to advise people where they're at

00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:32,140
and you know while pointing them to what

00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:34,630
they're likely to want to do in the

00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,220
future someone pointed out to me that

00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,830
when you're doing demos when you're up

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:41,200
here giving talks if you had a comment

00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,210
to you're you know within the code as

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,060
you were writing it you can leave that

00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:50,350
in you can normalize that that is an

00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:53,740
okay part of an experiment it's

00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:56,830
important to remember that someone you

00:21:53,740 --> 00:22:00,690
know the way you're the way you're

00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:02,620
presenting on commenting or other

00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:04,990
experimentation experiments that people

00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:07,300
are doing is going to not is going to

00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,370
lead to affect how people think of

00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:17,380
documentation in the future like what

00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:22,660
kind of developers are becoming so thank

00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:29,200
you all for coming and this is me

00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:31,060
we should have okay any questions mm-hmm

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,070
we have time from one maybe two

00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:35,250
questions if anybody has something in

00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,250
mind

00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:45,429
have you ever used the Django spaghetti

00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:48,910
and meatballs package I have not but I'd

00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:50,440
love to hear about it I mean well I've

00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:53,320
heard about it I'm gonna try it here on

00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:58,360
my project a little bit but it basically

00:22:53,320 --> 00:23:00,280
does object entity mapping Maps mm-hmm

00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:05,260
automatically for all django models

00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:08,110
that's why i read so i have not used

00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:09,789
that um i think the name is incredibly

00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:11,530
clever especially as someone who has

00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:14,039
written a fair share of spaghetti code

00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:14,039
herself

00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:22,419
thank you very much the picture of the

00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:24,970
cat labeled cat seems it's funny but

00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:28,120
there might be people who aren't very

00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:32,470
familiar with cats or don't speak the

00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:36,460
language or or get easily confused with

00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:38,940
other animals or something so also

00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:45,850
depends maybe who's going to be reading

00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:47,350
the code and you do want me to AG sites

00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:51,159
well you mentioned in the last slide

00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:52,299
that empathy is very difficult so I'd be

00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:56,650
really interested to know what you think

00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:58,630
about how we should think about the

00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:02,010
people who are reading our code and

00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:04,510
whether if we start labeling our cats oh

00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:06,909
maybe we're helping somebody that we

00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:08,650
hadn't realized needed to be helped or

00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:11,080
maybe we're getting in the way of people

00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:12,640
who find that unnecessary information do

00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,520
you have a suggestion sure sure

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,370
I think it's important to consider what

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,770
language you're typing in what what

00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:23,169
language you are working in um like how

00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:26,830
strongly typed it is can give you some

00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:32,350
guidance as to you know how explicit to

00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:35,230
be and one thing one bit of advice that

00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:39,700
oh if I can remember it and it doesn't

00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:42,340
run out of my head right away one thing

00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:45,130
that I always look for like when I'm you

00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:47,230
know talking to people who are who I

00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:49,240
might be working on a project with is I

00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:51,370
say like do you pair program together

00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,240
like do you sit down next to each other

00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:54,640
but

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,710
and like see how people think about

00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:01,720
their code because that really gives you

00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:04,540
the opportunity to to have someone

00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:08,590
expressed confusion in a way that is

00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:12,490
lower risk and and you know doesn't need

00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:15,760
to be you know solidified in code and so

00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:19,060
if you find that you're working and all

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:21,910
of your junior developers have have pain

00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:24,070
points that would be an excellent time

00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:27,130
say we need to make this more explicit

00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:29,350
um and I it's it's interesting that you

00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:31,740
you brought up like you know having

00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:33,450
different words for cats because I've

00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,530
known folks who have done

00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:38,050
experimentation like what if we wrote

00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:41,320
you know what what if instead of writing

00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:45,130
in English we we were to write code in

00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:46,750
other languages like would um like would

00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:49,240
that change how people thought of the

00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:51,430
code and that's I think I think it's a

00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:55,360
really interesting thing to to think

00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:57,280
about yeah I hope I hope that helps all

00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,440
right thank you so much for coming Thank

00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,740
You Veronica you can take a nap on this

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,740
towel

00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:10,700
[Applause]

00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:10,700
