	Coding Like a Girl

Through the past years is being noticeable the interest of our industry in increasing the diversity as whole. People are getting more conscious of the importance of having a balanced team and how it is beneficial to be so.

This talk is not about gender war, of how one gender is better than another. Is about how having that balance the productivity and innovation can increase to make it a sucessful team.

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:29,460
English so goddess hi I'm Brazilian I

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,640
came from Sao Paulo I am I was the only

00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:41,610
would like first to type the organizers

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,530
for being so aware of the day of

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:47,960
diversity that they bring me here to

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:51,059
help you to improve the discussion I

00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,890
must say I'm pretty impressed about the

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:55,829
amount of women that I saw on this

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,800
conference I music I used to see 10

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:03,180
women out of 200 in some conference that

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,189
i went to and just just show me that we

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,850
have almost twenty one percent of women

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:13,260
now I think it's almost 90 women here so

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,090
that's nice nice to see there so thank

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,840
you thank you again and congratulations

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:21,210
for the effort I did about me you don't

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,210
know me I'm not a jungle developer not a

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:29,009
Python developer I am a PHP developer I

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:32,490
work sometimes with node 2 I also don't

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:35,100
have a degree in women's studies or

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,829
through pology all of this is my own

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,990
interest in the subject I have a passion

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,700
to attack in technology I am majoring

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,280
digital game development but I don't

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:48,090
work with God I'm a web developer as a

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,700
sad and are usually in my spare time I

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:55,229
play with Legos I have like twenty five

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:57,360
thousand pieces so yeah yeah that's a

00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:01,079
lot I know a little way a little

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,540
overboard on that but there's this new

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,530
Lego set there's a kwik-e-mart from

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,080
simpsons i want to buy it but trying not

00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:13,410
it's hard

00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:15,660
but let's see so what do you expect from

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:19,410
from this talk I want to talk about

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:22,380
diversity and how biased gainfully she

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:25,440
knows our decisions and what do I mean

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:29,640
like a girl some companies diversity

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,160
ports and how diversity is important to

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:36,120
a company in some initiatives that are

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:39,570
they're made and to some or sponsored by

00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:42,150
other companies I don't want to talk

00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:44,190
about how one gender is different from

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,430
another that's not what this is about

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:50,760
and this is about how both genders

00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:57,780
working together can make a better by

00:02:50,760 --> 00:03:01,530
the workplace so diversity when I was a

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,360
teenager in my biology class one of the

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,090
few things I learned because I'm not

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,420
really gone in biology was that about

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:12,959
DNA diversity you see species that have

00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,910
the most diverse DNA have better chance

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,870
of survival you can see that in bacteria

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:22,860
for instance where they can appropriate

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:27,000
other DNA from other bacterias to

00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:30,720
improve their own survivability although

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,850
this isn't not 100-percent analogy I

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,280
think the idea is the same the more

00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:39,450
diverse you are the more chance you have

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,760
to do something great you have different

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:44,310
types of diversity you have gender

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,160
diversity you have ratio in jada and

00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:49,140
don't just mean me or female have a lot

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:53,489
of transgender transgender people too

00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:57,060
and ethnic diversity also sexually

00:03:53,489 --> 00:04:00,090
intentional diversity I was at apple

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,040
store last year and I saw a girl working

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,829
there I think she was modeling she was

00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,049
isn't that hijab it I think that's the

00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:09,510
name and I thought that's awesome

00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:11,579
because they're not discriminating her

00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:13,350
because she's female and not in not

00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:16,250
because of her religion it's just just

00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:18,840
working there like anyone else and i

00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:22,290
think that's that's great because you're

00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:25,200
not limited limiting some more

00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:28,020
on in what they believe or what they are

00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,570
but in what they can do to help you

00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,790
that's I think that's the thing that

00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:40,020
people should look for what you can do

00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:45,090
is to achieve to help you improve bias

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:47,820
is the will have it it's it's the no

00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:50,700
notion that what we believe that people

00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,380
shouldn't or shouldn't do we have the

00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:56,730
set of parameters that we be through a

00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:58,200
life experience and sometimes if a

00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:01,260
person doesn't feel the parameters you

00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,660
get like confrontational or even get

00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:08,040
anger hurt someone or get some kind of

00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:11,250
hatred this and it is in a fundamental

00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,350
level what prejudice is like you get

00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:16,590
your bias can cause you're prejudiced

00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:19,560
and this pre concise concepts that they

00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:22,530
may determine your act your actions so

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,650
even though you think you have any any

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:28,140
prejudice you may be discriminating

00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:30,660
someone because they are fat or because

00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:34,770
they are old and you don't even notice

00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:37,050
it you just do it without noticing some

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:39,540
sometime ago someone I noticed that

00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:42,990
people wouldn't sit down to me on the

00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:45,660
train at the time I was weighing way

00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,640
more than I do today but because I was

00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,670
fat nobody would sit down next to me on

00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,530
the train and I noticed when I lost

00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,780
weight that people not sit down next to

00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,790
me but I don't think they were like I'm

00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:00,690
not going to sit next to the fat girl I

00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:02,970
think maybe they didn't but ok some

00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:07,110
people don't even think and you can

00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:10,880
maybe do that people of color or people

00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:13,290
from other religions for instance and

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,830
it's sometimes it's so deep inside us

00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:19,350
that it meets beads guys as a compliment

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:23,130
you know you're pretty competent for a

00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:25,220
developer girl the person who said that

00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:28,560
I was trying to make a compliment but

00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:31,620
why because I'm a developer girl I can

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,460
you don't find that out I'm not good

00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,560
enough to be competent what do you mean

00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,260
so

00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,450
all because of data is this project for

00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:44,910
harder harvard university called Project

00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:48,880
simplicity they research the gap between

00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:51,639
intentions and actions by measure the

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:55,270
response time between proposed

00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:58,530
situations for instance they have a task

00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:02,830
that you can't ahhh you can measure the

00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:06,100
gender versus science to see where your

00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:09,040
Allah your inclinations are so they put

00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:11,290
a couple words that are female or male

00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,010
Erica boards that are science or liberal

00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:16,780
arts and you have to associate them and

00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:19,960
according to your time response you want

00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:24,220
they will see you they will tell you how

00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:26,020
a line you are for instance these are

00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,270
the kind of test data they have that I

00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:31,870
have a lot more just this is the one

00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:35,229
that fits this life and I give this last

00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:40,539
one and did this talk last year and I

00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:45,460
did this test today again and this were

00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:47,620
my results last year I I were more

00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:50,890
inclined to the six percent of the

00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:54,430
population that he did that's test I had

00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:58,979
more associated more women to science

00:07:54,430 --> 00:08:01,840
than female with the mail there is some

00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:05,560
explanation for that in my case for

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:08,740
instance I studying some since I was 12

00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,960
in high school it where stem area where

00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,180
more focus so we had a lot of women

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,520
there so for me it's more natural to

00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,740
have more women but for the majority of

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,669
people it is and how this is what you

00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:24,310
can see to the 26 and 28 percent of the

00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:27,789
majority that associates men if science

00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:31,030
than women and today I did the test

00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:33,550
again and I was like yay I got the

00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:36,159
neutral position that's what usually

00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:37,779
should be everyone should be that one it

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,289
shouldn't have any kind of association

00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:44,320
between Jane Eyre or in academic domains

00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:46,000
but I think that's smart because I am

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,050
more involved in community now more

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,050
aware of people's needs

00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:53,450
so you kind of get sensitive to to what

00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,880
people can say and you you change that I

00:08:53,450 --> 00:09:04,339
think if you care you're ill you start

00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:06,800
to change so why I like a girl this has

00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:08,959
something to do with a story that

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,089
happened to me two years ago I was

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,399
working in a company that's why I bought

00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:16,519
so many Legos I they made me work like

00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:18,500
16 hours a day and when i get home i

00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:20,060
didn't want even to look at a computer i

00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:23,920
just wanted to do something that have

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:27,529
enough to do a computer so like us and

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:31,730
we were having this problem it affect

00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:36,140
about sixty percent of her customer base

00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:37,970
and the problem involved money so every

00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,700
time they're probably loves money a lot

00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:44,029
of people get running after you for you

00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:46,010
to solve and my colleague was working

00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:49,010
who was responsible for fixing because

00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:51,740
this was a part of the project that only

00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:56,300
he had work I didn't have any knowledge

00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:58,970
of it so every five minutes someone

00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:02,270
would go through the door and ask you

00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:04,880
just solve it yet and every time every

00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:07,520
five minutes people from financial from

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,899
a jar from every single part of the

00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:14,570
company so we closed the conference room

00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:18,399
during all the big TV and we started

00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:21,950
debugging the code after eight hours

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:27,529
debugging together we fix the problem

00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:29,690
tested Patchett and deploy it to the to

00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:33,170
the production servers everything was

00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:37,579
working good as new I was tired I could

00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:39,680
see mark holding my own in front of me

00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:41,779
for like two days with you eat it

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,320
wouldn't be enough if I had to see it

00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:48,769
again but he stops look looks at me

00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:53,949
seriously essays you know you're pretty

00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:53,949
talented for a girl and I was like

00:10:53,960 --> 00:11:04,880
I beg your pardon and he was serious he

00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:10,340
wasn't joking he really thought it was a

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:12,860
compliment because he's my friend I had

00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:17,510
some liberties with him I could say some

00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:22,810
stuff it's I can't tell now because of

00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:26,420
the time but I wasn't mad at him because

00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:30,320
I know he meant well I mean I knew what

00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:32,930
his intentions were I like him very much

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,530
and many cases he stood up for me help

00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:40,190
me so I didn't take offense but it

00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:41,690
really tell me nobody had and what was

00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,730
the first time that anybody had said

00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:45,740
that to me people who had called me

00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:48,230
stupid before but it's like they were

00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,480
trying to compliment me they were just

00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,500
trying to offend me this is just the

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,480
first time that someone tried to

00:11:51,500 --> 00:12:01,970
compliment me and they offend me so and

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:05,750
that got me thinking as women we can't

00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:09,130
fail we don't have the luxury of fail if

00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:12,830
you do if we do fail everybody notices

00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:14,510
because you made the mistake because you

00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:18,520
are women you know because you're a

00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:18,520
woman that's why I made a mistake and

00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:26,330
how many times have you got like so

00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:30,080
worried about doing something so wrong

00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:33,470
and you after just just paranoid you

00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,270
notice they were just parallel and how

00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:38,840
many times have you heard women can't

00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:40,430
drive like I'm Brazilian people that

00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:46,220
just scream on the street all the time

00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:47,960
women can't drive like horn yeah that

00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:51,710
they're they're pretty vocal about that

00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:57,100
and they are pretty vocal about this

00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:57,100
tool in the IT industry that so

00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:03,960
if your women you can't fail so you get

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:09,960
for a night because you can fail you

00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:12,300
it's work harder and other times you

00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:15,210
hear our young woman and you work with

00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:19,220
right cheek that's cool what do you do

00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:22,290
testing our customer support okay

00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:24,300
there's a lot of quality assurance

00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:26,220
people that I know they're really really

00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,620
good on they do i I can't do what they

00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:31,020
do I'm not like discriminating them but

00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:34,800
you have more ratio of women working

00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:36,900
that same goes to front end I guidance

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,940
when I talking about I was a developer

00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:42,630
the first thing he asked me are you a

00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:45,540
front-end developer like it was he's the

00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:47,880
fastest expose I ever seen as know I'm a

00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,740
back-end developer but why did you think

00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:54,300
I'm in front end developer oh because

00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:57,150
you know designing stuff Oh see I think

00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,810
that he doesn't know angular or react

00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:04,230
yes because I don't know that stuff I

00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:06,570
wish I knew but I don't so we have these

00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:08,880
associations just because your women you

00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:13,880
have all these expectations because you

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:17,280
are women and that really can have a

00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:22,860
weight on your shoulders for working in

00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:24,960
this field and I think that for the past

00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,360
three years you see more companies

00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:30,450
worrying about that and they started to

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:36,000
release this this diversity reports I'm

00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:38,310
going to talk next and I think this

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,200
culture is more common here in America

00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:44,280
everything is like a girl you punch like

00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:45,870
a girl drive like a girl and Brazil did

00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,730
you just call someone a even though

00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:51,660
you're there female you just called him

00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:54,570
a and it's the same same thing as

00:14:51,660 --> 00:15:00,270
calling someone like a girl here that's

00:14:54,570 --> 00:15:02,250
the same effect here and as a matter of

00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:05,220
fact I do everything like a go because I

00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:07,710
am ago I eat like a girl I work like I

00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,180
go I code like a girl because I am a

00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:11,420
girl I mean I'm trying to 8 i'm not a

00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:15,020
girl but you get the gist

00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:18,680
but another impact here is where is the

00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:21,740
male lead developer in our industry can

00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:24,230
be demanding are perfectionists we women

00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:28,880
if we are demanding our perfectionist we

00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:32,440
are bossy and to put it mildly I heard

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:36,320
other stuff but usually bossy they tell

00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:38,300
and i was working at this company I was

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,450
the only female internally developers

00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:43,340
and she said I had a coach and she said

00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:46,960
to me you know have a great

00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:51,080
responsibility here I always said how so

00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:55,130
as the only female on the team you need

00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:57,260
to become part of the of it without

00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:00,200
losing our identity so they can learn

00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:04,010
how to work with women without reading

00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:09,530
like a man and how many times have you

00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:12,620
heard a success joke and just ignored it

00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:15,110
because if you bring that to attention

00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:18,380
for your boss or someone else he will

00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:21,560
say to you ahhh quit complaining and

00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:24,080
just suck it up or you don't want to be

00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,480
that girl the girl that complains that

00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:30,320
girl that makes everything for a case

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,560
but this isn't healthy so what she was

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,000
saying to me is I need to make my

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,370
colleagues respect me because I'm a

00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,780
woman and treat me like a woman and I

00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:42,350
said to her this is a lot of

00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:44,150
responsibility I can't do that it's not

00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:48,500
easy for me chill just let it go and

00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:50,570
I'll see you have to do that and I mean

00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,000
I like to feel that I succeeded they

00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:57,140
treat me very well sometimes they do a

00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,400
joke another that's out of place but I I

00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,690
don't know they are too young and I

00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:03,380
think that's more because of their age

00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:08,290
but then because of their gender yeah

00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:08,290
like trainee 21-day no no

00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:16,209
and most of the diversity parts I'm

00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:30,159
going to show here are from google apple

00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:33,889
um Google Apple Facebook and do year I

00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:38,119
forgot it I had yahoo but they didn't he

00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:40,960
released their just 2015 diversity ports

00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:44,200
funny thing about yahoo table they can't

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,090
transgender people separately because

00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,710
that's not just binary I find that cool

00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:54,190
because you have a different statistic

00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:57,379
there you can see that's nothing change

00:17:54,190 --> 00:18:03,440
really but the good news is nothing got

00:17:57,379 --> 00:18:07,940
worse so that's okay yeah it's not worse

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:11,090
so that's that's improvement um you see

00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:13,869
that twitter has four points more and

00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:18,289
percentage it's such will relative

00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:21,169
measure measurement because if you have

00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:24,080
one person and you have got two person

00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:26,929
you get same percent improvement so it's

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,019
hard to tell how how many how much

00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:34,009
relevant this is but let's say it is

00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:36,710
just for the sake of argument and so in

00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:39,049
all areas most companies are have the

00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:41,480
same you can grab these reports directly

00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:45,230
from the company's web pages it will

00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:53,330
have not only general reports but race

00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:57,559
and ethnicity too so it's nice to see in

00:18:53,330 --> 00:19:01,129
fact things got word it's worse do you

00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:05,929
have ten percent before and they got

00:19:01,129 --> 00:19:09,139
thirteen percent no I just read an

00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:12,529
article today from Intel they double the

00:19:09,139 --> 00:19:15,259
number of minority hired there but they

00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:17,899
got a program where if you hit for

00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:20,239
someone that is for minority and that

00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:23,560
person gets hired you get four thousand

00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:28,940
dollars so money is a good incentive

00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:31,280
and but ok it they had results and I

00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:36,530
think that this companies in general

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:39,050
have really hard process of admission I

00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:45,800
mean I try amazon few times and every

00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:48,260
time I fail so that's okay from the the

00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:51,350
Apple perspective the number is curious

00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:54,710
because epic outs a little differently

00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:57,440
every female saleswoman every sales

00:19:54,710 --> 00:20:01,730
woman on the apple store is counted as a

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:05,210
tech higher I'm not going to discuss if

00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:07,610
it is or is not attack higher because I

00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:11,060
try to see here as a soft engineers

00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:15,770
database specialist stuff like that not

00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:18,710
like sales person but it's there right

00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:20,780
chicana is that a thing but that's why I

00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:25,460
don't know where it's higher than the

00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:30,830
others no effect it's more balanced

00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:34,280
except for Apple you see Facebook got 5%

00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:37,250
more hires from this year last year for

00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:40,220
this year and to be honest i don't think

00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:42,980
the fifty fifty percent it's tangible i

00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:45,050
think you should aim at that but you

00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:47,450
won't be able to gather and if you do

00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:50,240
it's like more of a casual casual I

00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:52,610
didn't like a result of your efforts

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,600
because it's just such a magical number

00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:59,900
and I think if you aim it between 45 to

00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:03,140
55 ratio I think it's a good thing

00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:04,970
because five percent it's not a temper

00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:12,050
sets not a high of difference from one

00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:16,190
another and about high level high levels

00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:21,430
are they call senior hires are people

00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:23,750
managers CEO sitios people like that I

00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:26,390
study for Anita Borg shows that

00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:32,380
companies that have more women on its

00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:32,380
own on top positions they have better

00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:37,110
better work environment for women only

00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:40,230
three levels

00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:45,929
because women there are managers know

00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:48,770
how hard it is to to be new at a company

00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:52,700
or it be inexperienced so they try to

00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:55,860
create a better path for women to follow

00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:58,620
known as a mater but just in general

00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:03,020
because they went through that they know

00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:06,420
how that works and you can see that from

00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:09,540
Google Twitter have one percent more and

00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:13,110
the others have that same amount bottom

00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:14,580
line is it's more the same from one

00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:17,610
company to another it doesn't change

00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:20,580
much you don't have a company with fifty

00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:23,280
percent women another fifty percent so

00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:26,549
you could say this is a problem your

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:30,150
company but what company usually do is

00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:35,400
to blame on the pipeline because you

00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:38,910
don't have enough women doing stem

00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:42,870
courses at college I mean it may be true

00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:44,850
but you can only blame on that you know

00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:47,549
there are women there that are available

00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:49,230
for hire to be promoted and you're not

00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:53,160
promoting then and you're not hiring

00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:55,110
that you can't maybe achieve fifty

00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:58,320
percent from one year to another but you

00:22:55,110 --> 00:23:01,559
can achieve 55 to 20 it's not impossible

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,240
but I only see company complaining about

00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:11,400
that I don't see company doing anything

00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:19,049
to further that to make it better but

00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:23,280
why why women don't aren't as much

00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:25,020
promoted as mayor you see may have two

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,460
point seven more chances to be promoted

00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:32,970
to a high-level position the women and

00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:35,700
because of that I i can i can see that i

00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:40,049
am one of this person's I don't see I

00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:42,600
Chi as a meritocracy women usually don't

00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:44,640
according to the to the study that's not

00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:47,309
me that I'm saying that this they study

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,650
but I agree with that because I don't

00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:54,870
see as a meritocracy either

00:23:49,650 --> 00:24:01,290
I see much about nepotism and favoritism

00:23:54,870 --> 00:24:03,480
I saw someone before being offer a lead

00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:06,450
position because he plays soccer with

00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:10,500
the boss and I'm a girl I don't play

00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:14,190
soccer I don't like it and so since it

00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:16,740
was an all boys activity on the company

00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:18,660
and I don't like soccer and they said to

00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:21,840
me how you can go to the soccer game you

00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:27,630
can bring you can make a barbecue just

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:30,750
because I'm the women again yeah but he

00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:33,780
was hired I me and I got mad and just

00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:35,790
left the company because it wouldn't

00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:38,370
make it better the he wouldn't change

00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:40,320
his mind and I would be so frustrated to

00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:45,900
continue to work there it's just better

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:50,250
to leave companies that already have

00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:52,070
women benefit from the fact that more

00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:55,910
women wants to come to work for that

00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:58,080
because when i see a company that has

00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:01,020
someone that I respect from the

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,710
community work working there I see they

00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:06,600
are friendly I want to work there also

00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:09,800
are you hiring it's the first thing I

00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:13,550
asked and so they have this advantage

00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:16,920
from other companies because of that and

00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:18,750
the lack of role models that was found

00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:22,050
on the study it's not like we don't have

00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:24,900
female female developers there aren't

00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:28,650
whole models we do I can't say about the

00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:30,810
python django community but i know a lot

00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:32,790
of good female developers in the PHP

00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:35,160
community and they are my role models

00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:36,990
but what they study means it's inside a

00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,300
company you don't have a home modern

00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:40,920
cider company so if you don't have a

00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:43,470
hormone inside a company you don't know

00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:45,990
how far you can get if it is possible

00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:49,290
for you to get there and to improve your

00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:53,160
path and improve your your technical

00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:54,600
education because as I t we never stop

00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,840
studying we are always learning

00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,840
something

00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:05,000
and in this case the study shows that

00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:08,720
the lack of role model as our senior as

00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,120
a problem from men and women also agrees

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,190
that is a problem but companies itself

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,200
don't see that as a problem also they

00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:18,169
don't see the lack of materials as a

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:23,570
problem but both male and female people

00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:27,230
see women more values more flexibility

00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:31,250
than map that has an explanation pretty

00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:35,059
obvious this may fall under that

00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:37,370
category that women have two jobs you

00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:39,890
work at a regular job and you work at

00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:42,260
home and then I heard that it's a third

00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:45,409
job that is where you make her self pity

00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:48,350
because you need to be pleading so you

00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:50,840
have three jobs there is a book on that

00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:56,740
I don't remember the name a friend of

00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:58,970
myself but this report shows the

00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,580
majority of women that works in tack

00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:04,730
have a partner that also works in tack

00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:08,419
and I think that it's like when you see

00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:10,370
a doctor dating another doctor it's

00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:13,280
because the other doctors knows how

00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:15,860
crazy their hours are how you have to

00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:18,440
pick up the phone and run away to attend

00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:21,830
a patient and I think as we are

00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,870
developers are also like doctors if the

00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:25,940
something fails you need to stop what

00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:28,850
you're doing and go there and fix it

00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:33,039
because it's not people's lives but as

00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:33,039
peoples monies and you know capitalism

00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:45,130
but the same Amanda working IT have four

00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:48,919
times more chances of having women

00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:53,120
having their partner being responsible

00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:57,320
for the primary responsibility for

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:59,179
childcare so the mail here that here

00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,820
have four times more chances to have

00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:05,600
their female or male partners I don't

00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:07,970
know taking care of their child so if

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,250
the majority of females have a male

00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:11,080
partner in IT so yes you have to drop

00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:13,149
their

00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,610
so that's why women value more

00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:19,840
flexibility than men and men values more

00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:21,760
money than women and this leads to a

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,279
factor that's women leaving the

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,390
workforce because of that not just

00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:28,600
because of that but this is a

00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:32,710
contributing factor you don't have

00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:37,360
flexibility you have a job that's hard

00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:39,880
to be successful because you have less

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:47,590
chance than a man to get a better

00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:49,809
position and you also have the

00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:55,480
responsibility of taking care of your

00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:58,389
family at the same time another hour ago

00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:01,570
I arrived today it was about Apple and

00:28:58,389 --> 00:29:08,289
Facebook they were offering to freeze

00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:13,899
woman's eggs yeah so they can work now

00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:15,039
and get word to be pregnant later I was

00:29:13,899 --> 00:29:18,460
like okay I don't know what to think

00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:20,679
about it but I think this is more a

00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:23,620
reflection of America culture because

00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:26,769
you have a lacy was talking to me you

00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:29,740
have 12 weeks of unpaid maternity leave

00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:33,130
in Brazil you can have two four to six

00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:35,889
months of paid maternity leave and you

00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:38,889
can be fired if you are pregnant if you

00:29:35,889 --> 00:29:41,889
are company has to hire you altruistic

00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:44,289
issue with money for all the mums are

00:29:41,889 --> 00:29:47,679
losing from jobs and when you come back

00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:51,159
you have five months of stability they

00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:53,919
can fire you so I think that's why they

00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:59,889
offer these kind of things because you

00:29:53,919 --> 00:30:03,399
don't have a good working law for

00:29:59,889 --> 00:30:05,169
mothers to take care of their child so

00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:07,179
the more time you put off to have a

00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:10,210
child more successful you'll be in the

00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:13,269
company and more indispensable you be so

00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:18,840
you can have a child later and don't

00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:22,400
have a career and don't have a career

00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:27,260
budget I forgot the name

00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:30,650
neither Korea stained from that and but

00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:35,000
I think it's one of those those ideas

00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:37,820
that are they are a great deal in the

00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,150
soup and the surface but usually it's

00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:42,740
not in the inside like it's like

00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:44,570
someone's trying to take make you a

00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,610
compliment in actuality they are failing

00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:49,490
you I think it's far as the same

00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:52,520
category because this is my choice right

00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:54,980
I mean I ok it's a benefit you do what

00:30:52,520 --> 00:31:00,400
if you want but it's like if everyone is

00:30:54,980 --> 00:31:02,870
doing it why why you do get pregnant now

00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,540
some expectations come if all your

00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:08,360
female colleagues do it and you decide

00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:10,220
to get pregnant pregnant they will judge

00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:19,850
you you will judge you because you were

00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:22,910
you're going to to demean yourself to be

00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:24,710
better that's why and I don't think that

00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:31,340
it's a good idea on the long run because

00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:34,270
of that the same study shows that you

00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:38,050
have twice as many men in the

00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:41,960
proportionally of course in the

00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:45,260
high-level positions than women because

00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:47,600
of this family and because of work

00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:50,720
frustration women tend to leave when are

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:55,910
the mid-level and you have more women on

00:31:50,720 --> 00:32:00,710
the entry level than men women live mid

00:31:55,910 --> 00:32:04,400
level positions as twice as much as the

00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:07,250
man what does this mean if it's if you

00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:09,770
have five men leaving the company every

00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:14,960
month you will have ten wiem 11 live in

00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:17,030
the company of mouth because another

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:21,680
symptom of that can be the token

00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:24,710
easement that means I don't know if you

00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:28,570
heard the word it means to have every

00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:31,790
women stereotype embedded into you and

00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:34,680
have people expect expecting you to

00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:41,100
behave like that for instance

00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:44,430
I know that workplace where I said about

00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:49,920
the guy playing soccer they had a we

00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:53,400
were doing e-commerce magento and every

00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:55,830
time the phone phone was ringing I had I

00:32:53,400 --> 00:33:00,060
had to be the one to pick it up because

00:32:55,830 --> 00:33:01,890
I was the female and my boss told me was

00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:04,350
that because the customer customer is

00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:07,950
like talking to you I was like okay but

00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:09,750
I don't like talking to him I don't want

00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:15,600
to talk to now I walk in I don't like to

00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:18,690
talk to people I don't like people so

00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,790
that wasn't the only time but it was

00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:23,670
only one of the contributing factors for

00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:25,860
me to leave the company tokenism and if

00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:29,100
that happened to me I probably happens

00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:33,630
to any other women there since I have a

00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:37,920
low patience so it doesn't need much

00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:39,900
from to just leave it at it and go do

00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:43,260
everything and anything that I want I

00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:48,240
just don't get confrontational with it

00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:54,450
isn't worth it usually so why diversity

00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:59,490
matters I said before about DNA of

00:33:54,450 --> 00:34:02,100
diversity and some study shows that

00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:03,890
women I have the companies that have

00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:08,960
women in the board of directions

00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:12,360
directors get the he turn of equity or

00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:16,320
retailer for investment as high as

00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:19,140
thirty five percent yeah it's a lot

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,150
25-percent a lot again depends how much

00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:23,820
I investing but it's a huge number

00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:28,220
thirty-five percent this study was made

00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:33,330
at Carnegie Mellon University and

00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:37,770
another study was made to see how groups

00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:40,800
reacted when solving puzzles and doing

00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:43,770
collaborative tasks they create groups

00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,860
from three to five people often they're

00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:47,700
all males are all females and they put

00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:50,250
only

00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:53,849
one male or one female in each group to

00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:56,159
see how people would response and every

00:34:53,849 --> 00:34:59,670
time a test was done they would would

00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:02,130
measure their IQs separately and sum it

00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:07,290
up to see how much the collective IQ

00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:09,720
from the group was they discovered that

00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:16,829
diversity increases group performance

00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:19,230
how D how the collective intelligence is

00:35:16,829 --> 00:35:21,660
increased and because of that and when

00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:26,520
they increase you have a team there are

00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:28,680
more effective and they come with better

00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:32,250
problem-solving in five better'n of

00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:35,880
innovative solutions how they did that

00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:38,579
so groups were supposed to talk about a

00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:41,250
problem or interact during the solve the

00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:45,180
puzzle solving and they saw the group

00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:47,670
where one person nominated that group

00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:50,490
was less intelligent than the group

00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:54,569
where people were more collaborative to

00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:57,540
solve the problem so groups with a

00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:59,339
better conversation turn-taking perform

00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:05,160
better than groups the where individuals

00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:07,650
were the majority of the problem this is

00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,359
why that they got they're not saying

00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:12,450
that because there are women there

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:16,020
they're dumber that's not what does this

00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:18,180
please no interpret no way what this

00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:22,349
means is it's the following they got a

00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:24,780
group with all males and they measure

00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:30,329
their collective intelligence and they

00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:33,930
sum it up for 4 15 and the same another

00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:38,220
group with only one women and they sum

00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:41,550
it up to 405 if you're like ok they're

00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:43,650
dumber than the other but the group of

00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:47,130
the only one we may perform better and

00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:51,000
then the group of all males there that's

00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:54,319
because we don't have something called

00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:58,650
social sensitivity it's higher demands

00:36:54,319 --> 00:37:00,720
so the better if you get the group that

00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:03,540
had the better score from

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:06,060
all males and the group that had at

00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:08,910
least one women if the worst score that

00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:12,360
group was even better than the one with

00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:14,130
the best score all male so if you only

00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:18,540
need one woman to make things change

00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:22,860
their this social sensitivity is a

00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:25,380
trigger for the number of speaking

00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:27,060
members what this means is not because

00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:29,940
we will talk more that's not what they

00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:32,150
are me they are saying that women are

00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:35,310
more engaged to have other people

00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:37,920
participating in this problem solving so

00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:40,770
as women women we tend to have more

00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,130
effect we see six people and only one is

00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:46,170
talking we all go that say something we

00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:48,270
usually are more preoccupied with that

00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:50,850
where men have not that preoccupies

00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:56,340
usually that's what they are saying on

00:37:50,850 --> 00:38:01,310
their study so Margie's were exchanges

00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:03,780
so they got a better problems of skills

00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:06,800
they also discovered the diversity

00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:10,170
powers innovation in your fluids

00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,660
innovations like key for success you see

00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:18,480
a lot of IT companies when they don't

00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:26,280
innovate they get like behind you see

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:28,350
for instance blackberry yeah but many

00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:33,420
thing many people think there is a link

00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:35,340
between women and innovation there's

00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,560
there is no I I think they don't know

00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:41,490
the cause yet but they think there is a

00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:43,820
link there is the center of talent for

00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:47,900
innovation they found this correlation

00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:50,640
but some things they can be said our

00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:54,120
competitive advantage because diversity

00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:56,460
Trump's individual ability company does

00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:59,880
there are more diverse they have they

00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:02,090
are ahead of other companies diverse

00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:05,220
groups have outstanding performance and

00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:08,570
for instance in the academic field since

00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:12,510
this is an University patents and other

00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:14,430
studies that have mixed gender on it are

00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:17,309
cited 32 for

00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:24,390
two percent more often then only all

00:39:17,309 --> 00:39:25,829
males are all females studies and a

00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:29,099
scotch page from the University of

00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:30,930
Michigan said if people think alike they

00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:33,270
no matter how smart they are they are

00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:36,300
most likely will get stuck at the same

00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:38,309
locally optimal solutions innovating

00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:40,079
requires thinking differently that's why

00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:43,109
the varsity power is innovation and

00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:45,089
makes sense if you're all women you're

00:39:43,109 --> 00:39:46,800
going to think that way if are all black

00:39:45,089 --> 00:39:49,260
males are going to think away from all

00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,450
white males are going to think away so

00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:54,420
the modelers group of people you have

00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:56,970
the model of the box ideas you have it

00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:02,490
makes sense so but people usually choose

00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:04,380
to ignore it another studies film on the

00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:07,619
business school just concluded that the

00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:10,890
optional representations 5250 but it

00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:13,819
depends on the task are doing for

00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:16,910
knowledge transfer experimentation and

00:40:13,819 --> 00:40:22,230
task performance is fifty fifty percent

00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:26,000
but for self confidence and a six

00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:29,069
percent amen that I think and this is me

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,359
thinking let's not only study just mean

00:40:29,069 --> 00:40:35,849
conjecturing something that's when

00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:38,630
you're all on a crown and there are more

00:40:35,849 --> 00:40:42,540
women there you make you feel more safe

00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:45,690
because as i don't know where i saw this

00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:49,260
but like men are the first cause of

00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:51,750
women's death if you you can't count

00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:54,210
like domestic violence and stuff like I

00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:56,520
think it's more about our limbic system

00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:59,130
there is made to protect us and I'll let

00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:02,430
me existence more like you're you're you

00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:05,760
run or your attack it only has two

00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:07,559
responses and if you have more females I

00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,020
delivered sister respond you don't need

00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:12,589
to attack you can be there cool it's

00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:16,280
more like a primitive response than a

00:41:12,589 --> 00:41:21,500
conscious response that's what I think

00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:21,500
but you can split that if it's okay and

00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:29,900
i won wanna talk about this guy

00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:37,430
um black sighs dude are the guy who does

00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:40,400
cosmos the web series he has 17 honorary

00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:47,869
doctorates that means he's know his

00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:50,720
and there is a conference in New York

00:41:47,869 --> 00:41:53,270
where people were talking I don't know

00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:56,810
about what but someone asks what about

00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:59,660
chicas in science and the mediator said

00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:01,730
Oh someone he wants to talk about the

00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:04,570
generic difference between women and men

00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:07,460
and he was like hi I want to talk I

00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:11,300
never been female but I have been black

00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:14,390
on my life he starts and he starts to

00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:17,290
saying that working as an astrophysicist

00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:19,970
was the path of most resistance to him

00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:22,910
and I can relate relate to that because

00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:25,369
when I told my mom I would like to do

00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:28,430
electrical engineering I did two years

00:42:25,369 --> 00:42:30,910
of life engineering and my family were

00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:34,460
all like don't you want to do business

00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:37,970
administration or nursing school I was

00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:43,099
like no i don't and he was taught the

00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:47,330
same so every time people would take you

00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:50,500
down to they were trying to minimize

00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:54,170
your dream say it's not possible and

00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:58,780
this is so true for him as a black male

00:42:54,170 --> 00:43:01,460
and as for us as women in science and

00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:06,800
there is a link I'm going to laugh there

00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:09,440
you're going to see and he ends with

00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,720
that before we start talking about

00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,630
generic differences you got to come up

00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:18,080
with a system that seek opportunity then

00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:19,280
we can have that conversation so it

00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,450
doesn't matter you're genetically

00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,900
different we have different

00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:26,930
opportunities a guy has two point seven

00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:28,849
more chances to be promoted and we don't

00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:30,440
have the same chance so you can't talk

00:43:28,849 --> 00:43:32,720
about generic difference if you don't

00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:38,359
offer me the same chance as you do the

00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:38,960
other guy so how can we as a community

00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:43,010
hell

00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:45,650
to improve diversity I want to talk

00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:48,710
about this this is our project from a

00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:52,130
female called developer in the PHP

00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:55,040
community Kayla Daniels but it's pretty

00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:57,770
generic it's not just for women it's for

00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:03,190
everything I think it's a ecosystem to

00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:07,190
empower developers and you have like

00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:08,839
discrimination you shouldn't criminate

00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:13,670
someone because of what they believe or

00:44:08,839 --> 00:44:16,070
what they are boundaries it's like your

00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:20,270
comfort levels are different than mine

00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:24,859
so you need to learn to respect that we

00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:30,170
are our biggest assets none of us learn

00:44:24,859 --> 00:44:34,940
when was born knowing everything we all

00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:39,349
learn from during our lives so because

00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:45,170
of that we are big as assets so he

00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:48,230
turned a favor teach someone respect the

00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:51,859
finance to each others like you wish

00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:56,690
like you you wish to be treated that's

00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:58,369
like everyone think should think like

00:44:56,690 --> 00:45:01,000
that I don't want to be mistreated so I

00:44:58,369 --> 00:45:06,140
want me sweet others just see was that

00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:09,140
respect the reactions require grace as I

00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:11,180
heard my male colleagues saying death I

00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:14,030
was pretty intelligent forgot I wanted

00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:19,970
to fight him but it will not service

00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:22,609
anything if it wasn't worth it so to be

00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:25,609
to think better how to respond to stuff

00:45:22,609 --> 00:45:28,220
like that and opinions are just that

00:45:25,609 --> 00:45:30,140
opinions if you respect your own

00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:33,050
opinions you should expect the opinion

00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:35,020
of others so even though you don't agree

00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:39,190
you should respect their opinion and to

00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:41,690
err is human so you need to tolerate

00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:43,670
human mr. honest mistakes sometimes

00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:46,790
people you say something they don't mean

00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:49,820
and you should learn to not take offense

00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:52,460
on it because you're probably going to

00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:55,020
do it sometime at some point so

00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:57,780
that's my description there on the

00:45:55,020 --> 00:46:01,200
website and you can help lest you last

00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:03,810
year we only had seven items do the tour

00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:06,030
is human it's new so you can always

00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:10,710
contributes not only for PHP developers

00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:12,630
for the whole developer community the

00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:16,260
other one is this one I saw people talk

00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:19,170
about mentoring and I this is the

00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:23,190
example we have in the PHP community so

00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:25,550
people who have time available are

00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:28,530
listed are to help someone that it

00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:31,890
doesn't know much and this is not only

00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:35,339
food for minorities is this for everyone

00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:38,880
so everyone can help someone and there

00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:43,230
is a IRC channel on freenode at the case

00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:48,890
for PHP metering it's the same name so I

00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:51,690
think you you can take this as like a an

00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:54,150
example and took what is best and fit

00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:57,119
around in our community it's just for

00:46:54,150 --> 00:47:00,240
that it's it works I have a mentor and

00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:02,640
he helped me a lot to improve my

00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,920
performance to improve my code and I

00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,770
think people should and I am mentoring

00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:10,260
someone else so it's like it's you learn

00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:15,420
when you teach so you should give back

00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:19,560
to others and other programs that's more

00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:22,470
focusing on women I can talk about the

00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:24,839
other ones only from Finch few women but

00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:26,700
we only we don't only have women there

00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:28,829
have a lot of May in there too that's

00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:30,780
it's all inclusive everyone can

00:47:28,829 --> 00:47:32,790
participate we don't discriminate anyone

00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:36,119
there's a lot of white males there too

00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:38,339
and they help us and we accept any help

00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:40,530
there is there's any help us out welcome

00:47:38,339 --> 00:47:41,790
and I think I don't know about the

00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:49,190
others but I think the idea is the same

00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:49,190
it's to be inclusive not exclusive and

00:47:49,870 --> 00:48:06,250
questions can the women who have had

00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:11,050
that question that she brought up a

00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:14,290
couple times the or this compliment you

00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:29,170
are like very talented for a woman can

00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:31,980
you raise your hands just to summarize I

00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:36,220
think that was every woman in the room I

00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:38,080
would um I I could encourage that

00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:42,910
discussion and we could just keep going

00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:48,280
with our experiences okay as women but I

00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:52,920
I would love to hear more about positive

00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:56,950
for specific steps that you've

00:48:52,920 --> 00:49:00,910
experienced and you said that you left a

00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:05,200
company have you had to confront anyone

00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:10,570
and what was that like for you or

00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:15,010
something along those lines I actually

00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:17,320
have a very confrontational spirit but I

00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:22,150
learned that at work doesn't bode well

00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:25,090
to do that but at the beginning of my

00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:28,900
career I would like say that for

00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:33,310
people's face and it would mean usually

00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:35,770
me getting fired are people not talking

00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:37,630
to me for a while because I had a lot of

00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:40,810
anger because I didn't understand why

00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:44,050
people were that way and after a while I

00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:45,820
learned why people are the way and how

00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:48,340
can I and I learned that being

00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:51,730
confrontational it doesn't help you need

00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:55,210
to be more and I don't need for you to

00:49:51,730 --> 00:50:01,390
run away from it but you need to show

00:49:55,210 --> 00:50:03,670
some thoughts about it you need to show

00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:05,770
some data because oh

00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:08,079
the fact I told you here are from

00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:13,000
studies some stuff on in other word my

00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:16,750
opinions but because usually from people

00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:20,440
from our industry people rely on data

00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:23,500
and much less an opinion so if you

00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:27,250
confront people with facts and not just

00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:30,760
opinions it may be a little go better

00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:33,460
than just why did you tell them that to

00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:37,359
me you know maybe that I think it works

00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:40,030
better but up usually me getting away

00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:43,059
from company to a smile Matt me running

00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:45,280
away from it from the problem because I

00:50:43,059 --> 00:50:49,180
couldn't deal with it and now I know a

00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:51,609
little more how to do with that but it's

00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:53,380
too hard because it's easier to run away

00:50:51,609 --> 00:50:56,260
and get another job I live in some

00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:59,829
pallets the biggest city in Brazil so

00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:01,450
there's a lot of jobs there so okay you

00:50:59,829 --> 00:51:03,220
are you going to treat me that way

00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:06,010
there's another company I can go and

00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:07,650
that was more than way in this is hard

00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:12,490
because when you go to job interviews

00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:15,190
why did you change jobs yeah you know I

00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:17,559
wasn't feeling like it's hard to explain

00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:19,480
because usually the people from a jar

00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:22,000
doesn't doesn't know how it is to be a

00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:25,690
woman in the industry and you just have

00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,339
to say oh they were downsizing and

00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:30,790
you'll have to lie because if you tell

00:51:27,339 --> 00:51:33,040
the truth that you left there because

00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:34,780
you were treated badly they didn't treat

00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:38,170
you with respect they're going to say

00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:41,799
this girl's problematic if people don't

00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:43,990
get that usually unfortunately I mean

00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:48,609
they're in my in Brazil it's like that

00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:51,670
so I had to say yeah it crisis i don't

00:51:48,609 --> 00:51:53,619
know the economy it's something like

00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:54,940
that unfortunately you have to go with

00:51:53,619 --> 00:51:58,990
that because everybody goes through the

00:51:54,940 --> 00:52:01,690
head so they won't dispute that but

00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:03,730
that's okay well Red Hat has an office

00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:07,599
in Sao Paulo and we would love to have

00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:15,270
you oh i just got a job right now i

00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:15,270
