	Intro to Mocking: Why Unit Testing Doesn't Have To Be So Hard by Daniel Davis

Many developers want to write better code, but simply don't know how to write units tests for:

Code that calls other code (i.e. code with dependencies)
Methods that have no return value
Code that throws exceptions
Mocking provides a valuable tool for solving these problems. In this talk, we'll discuss the scenarios in which Mocking is useful, the strategies for addressing each of the cases above and write simple, clean unit tests using the built-in Mock library.
