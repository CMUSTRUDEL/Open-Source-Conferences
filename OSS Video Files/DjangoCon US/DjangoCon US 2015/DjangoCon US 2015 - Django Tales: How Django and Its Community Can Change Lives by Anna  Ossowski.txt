Description: 
	Django Tales: How Django and Its Community Can Change Lives by Anna  Ossowski

"I came for the framework but I stayed for the community.“ Many people make this statement when asked "Why Django?“. The Django community can change lives and has changed many lives, including my own. I’d like to share Django Tales with you, stories of inspiring women whose lives were changed by learning Django and becoming involved in the community. But what is it that makes the Django community so special and awesome? What do we all love about Django and its community? There is no doubt that the Django community is great but we’re not done yet! There are things we can improve. So what can we do better? And how can you help improve our community? How can you help people become part of our community? If you’re curious about the answers to those questions and would love to hear inspiring Django Tales, then this is the right talk for you :)

Some things I will talk about:

The "Your Django Story“ interview series on the Django Girls blog

Why Django Stories?

How Django can change lives: Stories of awesome whose lives were changed by learning Django

What’s awesome about the Django community?

We’re not done yet! What can we do better?

How can you help people become part of the community/make our community better?

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,820
changed by doing so and in the second

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,729
part will take a closer look at the

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:38,520
Django community itself okay let's start

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:41,040
with the Django stories first I'd like

this interview series so we studied it

00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:29,640
for a couple of reasons the number one

00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,200
reason was we wanted to show that there

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,680
are a lot of awesome women in the

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,540
community who do django that some of you

may never have heard of and the second

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,950
reason is we wanted to show that there

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,900
are so many ways which can lead you to

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,239
work to a career in programming you

00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,470
don't need a computer science degree you

00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,410
don't need a boyfriend who's a

00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:54,510
programmer you can start now and learn

00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:57,420

00:02:54,510 --> 00:03:00,540
women we featured so far there are 65 of

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,940
them and they're a lot more to come we

if you feel inspired please check out

00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,570
the blog so this is Dori and Ori was one

00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,370
of the first Django girls attendees who

00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:38,580
got a job after attending a workshop

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,860
she's from Budapest and she studied

00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,570
psychology and philosophy and after

00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,420
finishing her degree she didn't really

00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:48,180
know what she wanted to do but she was

00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:51,390
interested in digital humanities so one

00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,880
of her friends recommended that she look

00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:56,160
at the Udacity website and she started

00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,900
teaching herself coding she then applied

00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,250
for the rails girls summer of code but

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,530
she didn't get in which she was really

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,510
upset about but she got into the Django

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,180
girls workshop and after the workshop

00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,610
she went home she quit her job and she

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:12,150
started teaching herself cutting

00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:14,280
full-time and after speaking about

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,079
Django girls at a local meetup she was

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,720
invited for an interview and she scored

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:23,010
her first job this is what she wrote on

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,750
Twitter Doria is now been working at the

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,550
company for almost a year

00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,370
she organized to django girls workshops

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:31,650
in budapest she's very involved in the

00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:34,560
local Python community and she coached

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:36,690
at for Django girls events and I think

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,150
she's the first person who coached

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,910
organized and attended a django girls

00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:44,700
work chef this is just one example of

00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:47,340
how Django girls can turn women not only

00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:50,460
into developers but new community

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:52,950
leaders dories actually not very

00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,810
interested in django itself she's more

00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:57,300
interested in pure python development

00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,940
but here's what she says about the jenga

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,930
community she'd want to be part of the

00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:07,470
django community even if in django suck

00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:08,760
because in communities also so it's all

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,560
about the community and i actually

00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,720
talked to people all the time and they

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,520
tell me you know i don't attend these

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,190
conferences because i'm particularly

00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:21,450
interested in the code i come here for

00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:23,700
the community next door is my friend

00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,830
King nest jori king as from Poland she

00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,740
just moved to Scotland last week well

00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:32,340
she'll study computer security and

00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,380
forensics and like dory i'm at kinga in

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,120
berlin at the very first django girls

00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,850
workshops and i can say it's because of

00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,550
junior girls that I met my two very best

00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:44,550
friends we traveled together we organize

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:48,120
workshops together we chat pretty much

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:50,370
every day and kinga organized to django

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:54,390
girls workshops last month she organized

00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:57,630
one in her hometown oof and her mom

00:05:54,390 --> 00:06:00,120
and her grandmother a proud to attend

00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:02,070
the workshop and got in her grandma

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,720
actually broke her arm in her leg so she

00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,700
couldn't come but she really wanted to

00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,590
and her grandma said her biggest

00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,660
motivation for attending a django girls

00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,340
workshop was to show people that you're

00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,900
never too old to learn something new

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,330
which i think is really really awesome

00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,640
and yes i do believe we can call that

00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:20,930
one of King us biggest successes when it

00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:23,640
comes to spreading the love of coding

00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,650

00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:59,010
started when her dad discouraged her

00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:01,140
from starting a career in science Andy

00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:03,029
was into video game programming then she

00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,579
was into 3d animation she ended up

00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:10,040
studying graphic design and then changed

00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:12,510
her major to web development i think and

00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,820
Jillian after college she had several

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:17,190
jobs as a PHP developer front-end

00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,930
developer and Python developer and this

00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,060
year and he organized to awesome

00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:23,760
workshops in Mexico which were a huge

00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,980
success and at the same time she started

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,500
teaching herself Django and after only

00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,810
three months of experience with

00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,370
tutorials she scored her first job as a

00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:35,010
Django developer which is really really

00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:37,350
cool and then at the Django birthday

00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:39,089
party and he gave her very first

00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,910
conference talk about the mysterious

00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:44,519
Python community in Mexico and with the

00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,620
help of Jeff Triplette she scored her to

00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:49,500
she just scored a job in salt lake city

00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,510
where she works as a django developer

00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,250
which is really really cool so I do

00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:57,990
think it's safe to say that Andy

00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:59,970
definitely proved her father wrong and

00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:02,310
he also loves about the community that

00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,990
it's approachable and friendly and she

00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:09,149
told me that she's really happy that she

00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:12,480
switched from PHP to django this is

00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:14,310
Erica erica is from Slovenia and after

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,310
high school Erica went to beauty school

00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:19,350
and became a hairdresser and after

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:21,660
working in that job for a while she then

00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:25,620
switched to sales which he didn't like

00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:28,290
and then she started working at as a

00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,180
social worker for a project which help

00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:33,000
young drug addicts find their way back

00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:35,880
into society and during that job she

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,380
would always teach them I want to do

00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,209
fill in the blank with what you wish to

00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,480
do in life and I'm willing to work hard

00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:44,610
to get there so she decided to practice

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,279
what he preached and she went back to

00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:49,410
school she had to finish two degrees and

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,709
at the age of 27 she enrolled in college

00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:54,540
to study computer science and after

00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:57,680
college she got involved in the Django

00:10:54,540 --> 00:11:00,550
community and she works as a Django

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:05,080
developer and she's very active in the

00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:06,850
munity and slovenia here's what Erica

00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,130
says I think that statement is really

00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:11,110
really powerful Django would have never

00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:13,300
reached its height if it wasn't for its

00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:15,370
community it's almost like Django as a

00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,930
software framework and the Django

00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:20,110
community is the framework for the

00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:24,610
successful tech community I think that's

00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:27,459
something we can be proud of this is

00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:31,269
Sylvie Sylvie is an economist by

00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:33,070
training and she worked in the field for

00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:34,630
eight years and last year she started

00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:37,750
burning out she didn't really like her

00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:40,000
job anymore and her family actually has

00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,920
a pretty strong back of tech background

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,380
so when she was 12 she started teaching

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:48,100
herself coding for a while until she got

00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:50,050
distracted by other things and so at the

00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,850
end of September last year adoria and I

00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:56,440
were organizing Django girls budapest

00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:59,380
and Sylvie applied and got in and she

00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,899
was so inspired that each day after

00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,399
working for eight to ten hours she would

00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:05,920
come home and start working through

00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:07,750
python and django tutorials and she did

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,149
that for a while then quit her job and

00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:14,829
just started volunteering for the

00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:16,959
community and she's now super active in

00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:18,910
her local community she organized the

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,279
second general girls budapest edition

00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:22,540
she's on the organizer team for django

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,970
con europe which will be held in

00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:27,250
budapest and three weeks ago she was

00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:29,110
offered her first job as a Python

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:31,089
developer and keep in mind that she only

00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,649
started with python and django and

00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:37,329
december so i think that's pretty

00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:39,130
remarkable so he also says that since

00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:41,320
Django role she hasn't only become a

00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:46,720
developer she's become strong and brave

00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:48,490
too and she was really surprised when

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,649
she entered the community that people

00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:53,709
were helpful and willing to explain

00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:55,660
things at no cost because apparently in

00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:57,699
the economy community people will only

00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:04,420
really share knowledge in exchange for

00:12:57,699 --> 00:13:07,630
money and this is Jordan she's the

00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:10,149
newest Django girl and professionally

00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:12,190
Jordan works in social media but she

00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:14,200
says her dream has always been to become

00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:17,600
a Disney Princess

00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,670
that's what she says she said she uses

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,580
she just modified it from wearing a

00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:24,320
crown to wearing a suit and she wants to

00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:28,310
work on the corporate side of Disney one

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,290
day and Jordan attended the Django

00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:31,970
birthday in Lauren since she said that

00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:35,000
changed her life because she realized

00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:37,250
that coding was more than just changing

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,260
some numbers and letters to make some

00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:44,780
box appear and Jeff Triplette then point

00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,670
then encouraged Jordan to start learning

00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:49,490
Django and she's now working through

00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:52,610
hello web and learning HTML and CSS

00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:57,260
along the way and her goal is to build a

00:13:52,610 --> 00:14:01,040
Disney character search website that's

00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:03,440
pretty cool when I asked Jordan what she

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,480
loves about Django she said Django has a

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,580
personality its welcoming it's helpful

00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,500
it's contagious it's the first part of

00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,660
this coding world that didn't feel like

00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,480
numbers and letters and incomprehensible

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,310
data on a screen to me and Jordan lives

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,110
in Lawrence Kansas she was to work for

00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:20,660
the lawrence journal-world for the past

00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:25,220
three years where Django was born so she

00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:29,810
thinks it must have been fate okay now I

00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:31,310
told you all of these great stories so I

00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:33,200
think it's time to talk a little bit

00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:36,650
about myself I don't like talking about

00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:38,690
myself but it all has a reason so okay

00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:41,150
so I got a degree in English and

00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:42,710
theology and after finishing my degree I

00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:46,280
didn't really know what I wanted to do

00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:48,350
but I had a friend at that time who was

00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,450
a Python developer and he was always

00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:53,030
very enthusiastic about Python and the

00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:54,470
community and one evening I just asked

00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,180
him out of the blue do you think I can

00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:58,190
learn how to code and he was like sure

00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,530
everyone can learn how to code and he

00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:03,020
gave me the link to the Python code

00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:08,839
Academy tutorial and that's how my story

00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:10,970
with code started I was always one of

00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:13,339
those girls I liked math I like problem

00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:15,620
solving but I wasn't as great in his

00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:17,690
eighth grade in it as I was in English

00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:20,000
or humanity so clearly to me and my

00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:23,310
family my strength learned in science

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,290
they were in a different field

00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:28,680
I really like coding and I decided to

00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:33,720
give it a shot so i went to pack on last

00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:36,390
year then I went to Europe a thon what

00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,400
else did I do then I I gave my first

00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:41,370
conference talk at PI Tennessee this

00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:44,520
year I'm the DSF grants chair I was I

00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:46,410
became a director of the peasants path

00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,960
on software foundation i render your

00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:50,880
django story interview series and the

00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,800
leader of the pie ladies remote group I

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,350
was recently ordered offered a job to

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,300
work for all Darien and I'm not telling

00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:58,710
you this to brag about myself at all I'm

00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,260
telling you this because it would have

00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:03,180
not happened had it not been for Django

00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,190
girls in the Django community and so

00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:09,510
many people helping and encouraging me

00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:13,020
so thank you everyone and you may think

00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:16,279
that going from an anticipated career to

00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:18,420
from English and theology to a career in

00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:20,250
programming might be a little weird I

00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,620
thought so too for a long time until I

00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:25,440
watched the Django birthday talks two in

00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:28,560
particular there is the one but Andruw

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,410
Godwin the Django conspiracy and one by

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,450
david ryan born in the lfk and i

00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:36,180
discovered that there's a little bit of

00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:38,790
a jangles conspiracy in my own story so

00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,600
this guy is Langston Hughes he's an

00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:44,220
American poet who was famous in the

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,589
1920s during the Harlem Renaissance and

00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,420
in the last year of my college I spend a

00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:51,120
lot of time with Langston because I

00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:56,760
wrote my thesis on him and guess where

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:59,010
he grew up in Lawrence Kansas so maybe

00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:03,030
me discover and Django was fate as well

00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:04,949
after all so all of these girls I think

00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:08,790
are superstars to me and I find their

00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:10,350
stories to be so inspiring and some of

00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,060
those stories may sound like fairy tales

00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:14,819
but there was actually a lot of how it

00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:16,800
worked and how to hard work involved in

00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:18,810
all of them so i think these stories

00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,689
prove that django can definitely change

00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:24,510
life change lives and has changed a lot

00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:26,130
of lives including my own in order to

00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,860
keep the interview series going we need

00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:30,720
your help though so there's only really

00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,670
two criteria you have to me to

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,520
participate you have to be a woman and

00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:37,140
you have to work with django in any way

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,280
it doesn't matter if you work with it

00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,620
professionally you're just build

00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,360
websites for fun so if you are an

00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,010
awesome woman and would like to do an

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,200
interview please get in touch with me

00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:48,440

please please reach out to me as well ok

00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:58,770
so we've seen that the Django community

00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,200
definitely definitely played a big role

00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,730
in all of these stories I presented to

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,100
you so let's take a more in-depth look

00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:07,620
at the Django community itself in the

00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:10,860
second part of my talk what even is the

00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:13,200
community so colon says communities have

00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:15,540
standards values and rules that kind of

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,190
defines the community when we look at

00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:20,040
the Django community we have standards

00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:22,290
values and rules as well we have for

00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:24,870
example contribution guidelines we have

00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:27,570
rules when it becomes to becoming a DSF

00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:30,150
member but we also have values like

00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:32,300
diversity friendliness respect being

00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,800
welcoming considerate and understanding

00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:37,200
which we documented in the code of

00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,760
conduct and the diversity statement but

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,650
if you look at communities there is

00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,780
something that all people of the

00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:45,390
community have in common so what do we

00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:48,570
all have in common it's pretty easy we

00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:50,190
all love Django whether we love the code

00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:53,460
or the community there's something we

00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:55,500
all love about Django so let's take a

00:18:53,460 --> 00:19:00,060
look at what's really awesome about

00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:01,860
Django why Django you had some answers

00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,020
in the first part of my talk if you're

00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:06,060
interested in reading more answers again

00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:08,640
check out the interview series but it

00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:11,130
also asked on Twitter and he liked some

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:15,150
of the answers I received and a lot of

00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:17,670
them are pretty similar and just to sum

00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:19,560
it up people like the excellent

00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,510
documentation they like the code of

00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,400
conduct and the willingness to enforce

00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:25,920
it and that people are welcoming

00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,510
friendly and supportive so let's do a

00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,460
little survey again if I would have

00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:30,810
asked you what's awesome about Django

00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:36,180
who if you would have given the same

00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:40,230
answers that's quite a lot so I guess

00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:42,360
that that's accurate have you ever heard

00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:45,810
people say I came for the framework I

00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:47,400
stayed for the community if I who if you

00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,490
would say that's true for them if you

00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,320
look at your own Jay

00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:53,470
no story who you would say it's true for

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:57,700
them yeah and Andrew actually told me

00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:59,260
that he he didn't really do Django and

00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,820
then he was asked to do to write a

00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,990
django book and he told them while i'm

00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,440
not going to write a django give up

00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:07,210
before I don't like experience the

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:12,309
community and he told me he wrote the

00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:13,630
book for the community ok so I think we

00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:15,730
all agree that there are a lot of things

00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:19,390
that are awesome and that that Django

00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:21,250
does right but now comes the but like

00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:23,890
Lynn said this morning we're not done

00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,780
yet there are things we can do better so

00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,610
what are those things I asked on Twitter

00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:33,070
again and here are some of the answers

00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:35,650
are received and I like to take a closer

00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:37,870
look at two of them contributing a

00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:39,400
django is not beginner-friendly having a

00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:42,550
few beginner-friendly books with

00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:44,830
mentoring included would help i was a

00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:47,740
little confused when i read that

00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:49,570
statement because people talk about how

00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,580
beginner-friendly Django's all the time

00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:53,350
and then I thought about it for a while

00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:56,290
and I did some research and I tend to

00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:58,179
agree with it so what I did is I went to

00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:00,940
the Django project website i clicked on

00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:03,940
contribute to django and when you do so

00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:06,940
you find a bunch of information sign up

00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:09,340
for IRC sign up for the mailing list how

00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:11,140
to contribute your first patch but

00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:13,420
there's something missing which is

00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:16,240
really crucial we don't have mentor in

00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,890
formation we had speaker mentors for

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,230
Django con why don't we have code

00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:22,179
mentors for the Django project think

00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:24,670
about it this way one evening you decide

00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:27,010
I want to contribute to django and then

00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:29,170
you start working on your first patch

00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:31,120
and you get stuck and you need to ask

00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:32,559
someone a question but you don't want to

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,630
ask the mailing list you don't want to

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,679
ask on IRC because you don't know the

00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,929
people you don't know if they're

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,760
friendly you don't want to sound stupid

00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:42,130
you don't want to waste their time I'm

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,320
like the head I hate asking questions in

00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:46,059
front of a bunch of people so you don't

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,610
ask a question and then you don't finish

00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:51,040
it finish your patch and that way we

00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:53,020
might potentially lose contributors and

00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,960
I think there's an easy way to fix that

00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:58,360
it's much easier to just ask one person

00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:01,960
and we could easily fix that by adding

00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:05,549
mentoring information to the website

00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,549
then had a look at the easy pickings

00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:10,570
there were five of them at that time and

00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:12,130
they were all unclaimed which was pretty

00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:14,020
good but there were other times when I

00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:16,840
looked when all the easy pickings were

00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:19,270
claimed and they were still all hard to

00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,159
me and that's one reason why I haven't

00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:23,649
contributed to django yet because it's

00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:25,630
still hard so I think if we had if we

00:22:23,649 --> 00:22:28,990
would save the easy pickings and had

00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:30,789
mentors who could walk beginners through

00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:33,039
the steps of contributing your first

00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:37,539
patch or fixing a bug we would gain a

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:39,730
lot more contributors and someone else

00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:42,010
said that Django should offer more

00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,779
opportunities for sponsors to give back

00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,610
so that Django can grow faster and

00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:48,580
better and they didn't mean that

00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:50,590
sponsors should give back by giving the

00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:55,120
Django project money they meant that

00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:57,760
sponsors should let their employees work

00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,270
on django for free for a couple of hours

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:04,059
a month so if you own a company give

00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:06,789
your employees some time to work on

00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:09,820
django for like i don't know half a day

00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:13,330
a week a day a month I think that's a

00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:16,840
great idea next improvement let's take a

00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:18,669
look at our core team if I counted

00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,919
correctly they're currently only three

00:23:18,669 --> 00:23:22,870
women on the core team for a long time

00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:26,399
there was only one woman one woman on

00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:29,080
the core team which was care and Tracy I

00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:30,700
think we can do much better than that on

00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,429
our own mess lied you can actually see

00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:35,350
fifty percent women and I think that

00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:37,870
should be our ultimate goal so how can

00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:40,539
we achieve that if you went to pack on

00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:42,250
this your Guido gave a keynote and he

00:23:40,539 --> 00:23:45,130
said he would personally take the time

00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,779
to train two women to become Python core

00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:49,270
developers over the course of the next

00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:51,820
year if each member of the core team

00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:54,159
took some time to mentor someone from an

00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:59,049
underrepresented group we could reach

00:23:54,159 --> 00:24:01,539
that goal in no time also I would like

00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:04,809
to propose to change the name core team

00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:07,529
to support team or something else Jane

00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:10,149
girls did that recently and I think it

00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:12,399
it meant a lot to me and I think that

00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:14,659
change made a huge difference so if you

00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:16,309
look at the core of an apple the

00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:18,679
core is kind of like the heart of the

00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:20,690
Apple which helps the apple grow but we

00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:23,509
all do that for Django we all help

00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:26,359
Django grow in some way so we're at part

00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:29,359
of the heart of Django so why do we only

00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:32,059
call that small team of people core team

00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:34,639
I think we could by changing the name

00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:37,009
that it would be a lot more accurate so

00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:39,080
let's start thinking about that i would

00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:41,950
suggest support team if you have a

00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:46,249
different idea i love to hear from you

00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:48,529
next suggestion I would like to I would

00:24:46,249 --> 00:24:51,470
like the DSF to open up their membership

00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:54,109
and actually already proposed that to

00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:55,849
them so so far we only have two

00:24:54,109 --> 00:24:57,559
membership categories there are the

00:24:55,849 --> 00:24:59,359
corporate members and there are the

00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:02,029
developer members and the corporate

00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:05,149
members are members because they donate

00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:07,700
to the DSF and the developer members are

00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:10,399
appointed in recognition of their

00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:13,669
contributions to django and I don't like

00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:16,029
systems that appoint people because I

00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:18,619
don't think those systems are very open

00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:22,129
because it's awkward to nominate your to

00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:23,960
nominate yourself and even those people

00:25:22,129 --> 00:25:26,749
that I'm friends with I'm not sure of

00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,849
their DSF members so maybe I wouldn't

00:25:26,749 --> 00:25:30,559
nominate them and someone else would

00:25:28,849 --> 00:25:34,399
nominate them and so they will never

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:36,440
become DSF members which is unfair in an

00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:39,499
hour diversity statement we say we are

00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,629
what we welcome everyone so a logical

00:25:39,499 --> 00:25:45,950
consequence for me would be to open up

00:25:41,629 --> 00:25:49,070
membership the psf did that a couple of

00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:51,470
months ago I believe and what they do is

00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:53,269
that everyone can become a basic psf

00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:56,419
member which means you don't have voting

00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:58,279
rights but everyone can sign up to be a

00:25:56,419 --> 00:26:00,859
contributing member so you have to agree

00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:03,590
to the code of conduct and self-certify

00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:06,379
that you contribute to python or the tsf

00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:08,809
for at least 10 hours a month and if you

00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:10,639
if you look at yourself I'm sure that a

00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:14,989
lot of us who contribute to django for

00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:17,210
way more than 10 hours a month so let's

00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:20,299
start thinking about that i would also

00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:22,879
again like to propose to rename

00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:25,039
developer members to just members or

00:26:22,879 --> 00:26:26,730
contributing members because i think

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,950
it's misleading

00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:30,660
because not all of us are developers we

00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,429
don't all contribute code but we all

00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:34,890
contribute to the Django community in

00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:38,100
some way so I think we can find a better

00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:40,200
name for it and sometimes it's kind of

00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,730
like you have the developer members and

00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,250
then you have a different membership

00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:45,750
category and it's kind of like that if

00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:48,360
you're not a developer remember you only

00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:52,020
a second class member so i think we

00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:54,900
should really change that next

00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:57,299
improvement sometimes things become

00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,630
political in open source communities and

00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:02,580
that creates barriers to contributions I

00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:05,040
have not experienced that in Django yet

00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:07,440
some of you may have experienced it but

00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,270
I have experienced it in a sub community

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,480
of the Django community and that let me

00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:14,700
to feeling very unwelcome and thinking

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,250
about leaving that project and only

00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,840
contributing very little nowadays so

00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:21,600
sometimes what happens is that people

00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,340
create a project and then the open

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,530
source it because they kind of want

00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,360
people to contribute their time to make

00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:30,179
the project bigger but what they

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,429
sometimes don't want to do is to listen

00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:34,559
to people's suggestions and that doesn't

00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:37,200
work and I don't think we really want

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:39,870
that to happen so I think we shouldn't

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,480
only we do a lot we have a lot of

00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:44,160
initiatives that bring new people to the

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,260
Django community but I think what would

00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,510
what we should really concentrate on is

00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:51,450
keeping those people that are already

00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:52,890
community in the community that we

00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:54,900
should make sure that they actually stay

00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:58,590
in the community there's a pretty easy

00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:00,480
way to do that just listen to people and

00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:03,660
make sure that you actually hear them

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,549
and there's a big difference between

00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,350
listening to people and actually hearing

00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:09,600
what they have to say so when someone

00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:12,030
makes a suggestion you should

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,490
acknowledge the problem thank them seek

00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:16,650
help and see how you can improve things

00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:19,169
and I'm not saying that you have to do

00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:20,850
everything that people suggest but just

00:28:19,169 --> 00:28:22,320
make sure that you give them the feeling

00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:24,720
that you hurt them and yet that you

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,000
think about it so if you decide not to

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,950
do it at least take the time just say

00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,870
hey I hurt you I thought about your

00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:33,480
suggestion I don't want to do it because

00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:37,730
and then tell them the reason and the

00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,730
reason shouldn't be no because I said so

00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:48,390
okay oh and I also want to pan out so i

00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:51,060
think you should treat your contributors

00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:53,250
as friends not as employees especially

00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:55,560
if you don't pay them and i think that

00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:57,720
sometimes happens and i think it's

00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,640
really really important that we try to

00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,280
be kind to each other because you may be

00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,780
the founder of a project but if what if

00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,760
it wasn't for a lot of other people

00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:09,210
contributing your project wouldn't be

00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:15,270
what it is today which leads me to the

00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:18,300
next point money we should really start

00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:19,890
talking more about how we can fund open

00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,200
source projects like django more

00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:24,480
sustainably and russell Keith McGee he

00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,640
opened the conversation about this in

00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,980
his pack on Australia talk he's giving

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,930
the talk again at django con in Korea

00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,580
benfield he wrote an excellent excellent

00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:34,170
article about it so if you have time

00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,600
watch Russell's talk and read the

00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:38,370
article and I just want to find out that

00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:41,430
this is not about people getting rich

00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:43,320
from contributing the open source this

00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:45,390
is about creating equal opportunities

00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,130
because all of us were able to

00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:49,200
contribute to open source we have the

00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:51,030
time and money to do so there are other

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,580
people who need to put into putting

00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:56,100
those hours at their day job to make

00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:59,250
money to make a living so by paying

00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:01,830
people we contribute we help them

00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:04,200
contribute to django or other open

00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:05,760
source projects and let Corey says it

00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,950
turns out that time and wealth are

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,650
disproportionately possessed by the

00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:14,460
young white middle class and mail we

00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:17,880
really need to change that so how can

00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:19,470
you help of course if you have the

00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,270
financial means it would be awesome if

00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:25,170
you would contribute to initiatives like

00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:27,990
the DSF devna general girls or the

00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:29,850
Django current US and EU financial aid

00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:31,800
programs but there are a lot of things

00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:34,320
you can do which don't cost any money at

00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,750
all first thing which is so important is

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,880
just be kind if you're walking around

00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:41,460
Django con and you see someone looking

00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,410
kind of lost or sad just walk up to them

00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:45,540
introduce yourself ask them do you want

00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:48,240
to come to lunch with me do you want to

00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:50,490
go to the next session with me just be

00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,140
kind smile tell them there

00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:54,630
them tell them you appreciate their work

00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:57,630
kindness is so easy to achieve and

00:30:54,630 --> 00:31:00,720
something we so often forget the next

00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:02,220
point is encourage people encourage

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,320
people to start learning Django

00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,300
encourage them to submit their first

00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,690
patch to django encourage them to submit

00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:11,760
a top proposal even if they think they

00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:14,730
have nothing to say and you think they

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:17,040
do encourage them to come to a

00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:18,660
conference with you if it hadn't been

00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,220
for so many people encouraging me I

00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,780
wouldn't have done so many things I

00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:24,150
wouldn't stand here wouldn't be on the

00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:26,190
psf board I wouldn't be involved with

00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:28,970
the GSF I wouldn't work for a large area

00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:31,770
and it's all about encouraging people

00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:34,559
help connect the dots all it took for

00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:36,210
Jeff to do was to guide Jordan in the

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,280
red direction give her the right

00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:40,470
resources and now she's learning Django

00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:42,390
and she's super motivated all it took

00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:44,400
for my friend to do was to tell me yes

00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:46,800
you can learn how to program and to give

00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:49,020
me that one link if you had told me no

00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,550
and I don't think programming is for you

00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:52,830
than I wouldn't stand here today if

00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:54,960
someone's looking for a job and you know

00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:56,910
someone who's hiring just connect the

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,320
two it doesn't take a lot of time and

00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:02,610
effort but it makes such a huge

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:05,970
difference in someone else's life be a

00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:07,800
mentor this is Battiste explaining

00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:10,410
something to King measuring the django

00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:12,210
sprints at PyCon a lot of you may know

00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:13,800
Battiste he's awesome he holds the

00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:17,190
record when it comes to coaching at

00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:19,590
django girls events and he's an awesome

00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:22,260
mentor and I believe that it's every

00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:25,559
experts obligation to spend their time

00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:27,120
for help to help beginners if you think

00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:29,130
about it this way when you started

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,260
learning Django there were other people

00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:33,540
who knew more than you and those people

00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,490
helped you and they took some time to

00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,950
explain things to you and that's it's

00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:39,720
because of those people that you are

00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:42,570
where you are today so I think you

00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:46,550
should spend your time to volunteer and

00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:49,110
help other people just start giving back

00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:51,570
it doesn't have to be a whole day just

00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:53,760
an hour a week is enough I'll give you

00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:55,530
an example so my friend Ian I met him at

00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,020
PI Tennessee he lives in wisconsin

00:32:55,530 --> 00:33:00,360
elleven germany so there's a seven hour

00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:02,850
time difference and each wednesday he

00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,900
gets up an hour earlier so we can pay a

00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:06,180
program before he

00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:08,460
has to start working and it's working

00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:10,320
really really great I know that I can

00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,900
ask him questions he doesn't make me

00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,720
feel stupid and he learns because I'm

00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:18,060
asking questions so mentoring isn't only

00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,040
super rewarding you'll also gain great

00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:22,140
teaching skills and one tip I can give

00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,180
you the best the first step to being a

00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:28,110
good mentor is asking a lot of questions

00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:30,060
don't assume just ask as your mentee do

00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:32,220
you know that don't assume they know

00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:34,950
concept x and y just ask them do you

00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:37,470
know that that way you'll give them the

00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:39,240
opportunity to say no because if you

00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:41,430
assume that they know something they

00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,170
might feel uncomfortable to say I'm

00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:46,290
sorry I don't know that so just ask

00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:48,350
questions same goes for beginners if

00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:51,600
you're a beginner ask lots of questions

00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:53,340
Nicole Harris's asking questions isn't

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,560
just about helping yourself you're also

00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:57,060
teaching the community how they can

00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,800
better help beginners if you don't

00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:00,840
understand then your teacher the

00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,760
community the docs needs some

00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:05,280
improvement it is not a reflection of

00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,930
your intelligence or ability to learn so

00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,240
by asking questions you help the

00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:10,919
community you help us understand what we

00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,620
need to do better so I can only

00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:17,460
encourage you to ask lots of questions

00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:19,260
and my final suggestion is to organize a

00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:21,570
genuine girls workshop in your town or

00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:23,399
to coach at a django goals workshop if

00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:25,380
that's something you like to do I love

00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:28,950
to chat with you about it I promise it's

00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:31,140
a lot of fun just to give you an idea of

00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:33,780
what Django girls has achieved for the

00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:35,880
Django community in the past year this

00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:39,090
was Django girls in july two thousand

00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:44,880
fourteen we had a workshop in berlin and

00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:49,050
oh sorry and in australia and this is

00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:50,940
Django girls in may 2015 but you know

00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:54,540
there's still a lot of space left on the

00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:59,040
map so consider organizing a workshop

00:34:54,540 --> 00:35:03,360
yourself here are some stats from last
