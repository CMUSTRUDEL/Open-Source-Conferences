Title: DjangoCon US 2015 - Leveraging Procedural Knowledge by K Rain Leander
Publication date: 2017-11-03
Playlist: DjangoCon US 2015
Description: 
	Leveraging Procedural Knowledge

On the road to senior developer, one has to learn multiple languages. This often seems like a series of massive obstacles wherein each new language resembles a new beginning. However, developers may often underestimate the extent to which procedural knowledge from one language transfers to a new language. In this talk, I will demonstrate that the process from Red Hat Technical Account Manager to Django Girls workshop participant to OpenShift developer was a series of procedural knowledge transfers, wherein the obstacles to learning reduces with each new technology that is learned. I will provide specific examples, from using editors to troubleshooting issues, and conclude with practical recommendations on which language to start with and how to create a coherent plan for transitioning from one language to another.

I realize I'm the only thing standing

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,910
between you and lunch so I'm going too

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:27,240
fast but if you have questions more room

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,429
for questions okay so today is about

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,399
leveraging procedural knowledge which is

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:35,040
three really long words to say how to

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,510
learn and so don't be intimidated by

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,329
that part if you're new because

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,370
everyone's actually a noob I promise add

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,280
something we're going to talk about

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,170
procedural knowledge and how to

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:51,420
implement that first you're going to

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:53,190
know thyself by getting to know me we're

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,320
going to drink from the firehose return

00:00:53,190 --> 00:01:02,789
to our roots talk about a jingo girls

00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:05,850
workshop and talk about next steps okay

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:08,610
so procedural knowledge is actually

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,970
better defined better understood by

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,890
understanding declarative knowledge

00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:18,540
declarative knowledge is Amsterdam is

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:20,759
the capital of the Netherlands jay is

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:24,720
the tenth letter of the ISO Latin

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:27,570
alphabet it's really hot outside because

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,990
we're in Texas and I'm melting because

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:33,659
i'm from the netherlands that's

00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:36,360
declarative procedural is how you ride

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:40,140
the bike how you drive your car how you

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:45,060
train for a marathon which I've never

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:50,369
done how you learn how you do so its

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:52,500
facts versus process so why does that

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:55,439
matter well there are two schools of

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,829
thought one is that in order to learn

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,540
something new you learn the facts and

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:01,890
then you practice and practice and

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:07,020
practice and practice and practice and

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:08,280
practice until it becomes procedural

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,810
knowledge you don't even need to think

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,530
about it anymore and you don't even

00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:15,240
maybe

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:17,490
bur how you learned that fat and that's

00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:21,690
totally valid the other school of

00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:23,430
thought is that you learn something and

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,400
then when you want to learn something

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,080
new you remember the environment where

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,750
you learned that maybe there was some

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,550
white noise but it's a quiet room with

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,170
all the curtains blocked out and

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,360
therefore you want to learn something

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,420
new so you recreate that environment and

00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:42,030
you learn something else it's learned

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,230
more efficiently that way because that's

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,300
how you learn something else and your

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:53,730
brain goes ah I'm learning something ok

00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:55,590
focus so the first step to procedural

00:02:53,730 --> 00:03:01,590
knowledge is to actually know yourself

00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:04,290
and oh hi Sasha I am a ten-month-old a

00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:09,440
mother of a ten-month-old who is right

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:15,120
there and you can say hello later or not

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:18,750
um I first programmed on a TI 99 for a

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,160
computer which maybe you remember and

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:24,329
maybe you have no idea what I'm talking

00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:26,940
about and that makes me feel old but I

00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:30,660
one basic on the manual that came with

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,640
that computer and the only thing you

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,860
could do was follow the rules that was

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,590
it there was no hacking there was

00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,510
following the rules or it doing nothing

00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,090
you couldn't even take it apart and put

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:45,090
it back together and do something new it

00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:48,239
was that or nothing and so I learned how

00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,220
I learned I practiced and I read and

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,590
then I did and I found that if i just

00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:56,459
read the manual and then put it down

00:03:52,590 --> 00:04:03,510
that I it completely was gone so I I

00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:06,450
realized I had to go uh-huh ok uh-huh ok

00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:09,359
so when I self-taught myself HTML and

00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:13,850
CSS and PHP and JavaScript back when I

00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:18,180
was a developer for the web's I did I

00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:20,430
built a website it was on Angel Fire I

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,520
know i'm dating myself please don't

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,389
judge it's important for you to know how

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,460
you

00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:31,229
not necessarily linguistics or languages

00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:34,009
but how you learn and what you're

00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:36,389
comfortable with because that's what

00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:40,139
you'll use to apply and learn new things

00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:42,029
I like logic puzzles I like math and

00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:45,060
therefore every time I learn a new

00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:48,120
language I pick out relationships and

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,969
that may not work for you and if you ask

00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,529
the question at the end who are you to

00:04:50,969 --> 00:04:55,110
me I'll be like an though and i'll

00:04:52,529 --> 00:05:00,120
probably make up something just like hey

00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:03,060
did you might be a surgeon too so I work

00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,729
for red hat this is actually a red hat

00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:10,620
because the Fedora doesn't travel well

00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:12,360
internationally so i took this because

00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,370
it crushes up and goes in the suitcase

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,949
really easily i started out as a

00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:22,560
technical support engineer and six years

00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:25,620
ago when i started hi you had to pass

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,650
the rhce within 90 days you got three

00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:34,379
chances or you were fired and that's a

00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:36,589
lot of stress no pressure I want to tell

00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:40,589
you a little bit about the US Air Force

00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:43,889
military boot camp vs. Red Hat's boot

00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:45,899
camp I know it doesn't seem related but

00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:48,839
it is give me a second I know lunch is

00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:51,899
calling give me a second so the US

00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:54,240
military boot camp for the United States

00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:56,430
Air Force is you go to Lackland Air

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,969
Force Base and it's about six weeks and

00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:02,849
you exercise a hell of a lot you run

00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:04,529
like crazy you get a lot of orders you

00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:08,009
change clothes a bunch you get your hair

00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:11,490
shaved off it seems like hell if you're

00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:13,949
there maybe you're sleep deprived you

00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,319
learn a lot of rules and it seems like

00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:19,129
the purpose of it is to get you in shape

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,680
and teach you how to use a gun maybe and

00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:26,159
maybe learn those basic skills but the

00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,770
actual underlying reason for that boot

00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:31,919
camp is so that when someone tells you

00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:36,019
to jump you jump you don't even ask how

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:38,120
high you just jump that's the underlying

00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:39,350
so then we get to Red Hat

00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,669
and I promise there's no sleep

00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,770
deprivation well there is sleep

00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:47,930
deprivation but there's there's no

00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:50,300
running definitely and it's it's 90 days

00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:54,919
it's actually 30 days and then you get

00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:58,490
three chances and the obvious is that

00:06:54,919 --> 00:07:02,300
you're learning to pass the rhce yay and

00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:04,720
not get fired whoo but the underlying is

00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:07,070
that every time you answer that phone

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,050
you will have no idea what they're

00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:13,580
talking about none and you have to

00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:16,160
completely stay calm what are you trying

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,260
to do how are you trying to do it what's

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,810
happening what do you want to happen

00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:23,570
stay calm gather the information and

00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:26,180
then hang up the phone and learn

00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:27,889
whatever they're talking about in a very

00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:31,490
short period of time and that's what Red

00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:34,610
Hat boot camp is so there are two layers

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:36,289
to things and you basically have to

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,750
drink from the firehose and that's what

00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:41,660
I did procedural knowledge I started

00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,520
taking the logic I personally need a

00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:46,970
white noise generator lots of quiet

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:53,740
outside of that darkened room and logic

00:07:46,970 --> 00:08:02,690
between commands line words and I passed

00:07:53,740 --> 00:08:04,940
yay after the second try so I did that

00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,699
for six years I was a technical support

00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,229
engineer and I got promoted and stuff

00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:11,060
and then I moved to the Netherlands

00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:12,380
became a technical account manager and

00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,510
while you're doing that you're

00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:16,669
constantly having to learn lots and lots

00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:20,510
of information really fast and inhale

00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:23,840
and I went okay that's great but I need

00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:26,750
a break and then I gave birth to that

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:31,220
guy the 10-month old not like that guy

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:33,380
in the front the 10 month old and in the

00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:36,169
Netherlands you're allowed to scale back

00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,880
at work and go to part-time but you

00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:41,150
can't be a part-time technical account

00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:45,170
manager so my job became to look for a

00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:46,670
new job hopefully within red hat so I

00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,410
started taking workshops in the very

00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:52,220
first workshop I took his jingle girls

00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:56,640
up in town again which is where I live

00:08:52,220 --> 00:09:03,150
groaning again if you're American this

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:04,860
place and I loved it preparation again

00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:07,020
was using procedural knowledge it was

00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:10,230
using get which I had lots and lots of

00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:14,790
experience from this guy it was using

00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:17,550
troubleshooting lots of Google and I

00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:21,090
remembered how much I loved web

00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:24,030
developments and I went why I am I not

00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:33,230
programming anymore well I don't have

00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:36,300
time ok so I put up a app on heroku com

00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:45,660
which I'm very tempted to upload to the

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:47,070
Microsoft as your site Red Hat ok after

00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,730
the workshop and did the tutorial

00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:52,380
extensions which you can get there I

00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,760
uploaded it on openshift I would give

00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,860
you the link except I've torn it down

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,570
and put it back up and torn it down and

00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:01,380
just hacked away you can get your own

00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:04,280
free hosting there and make a lot of

00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:12,030
ugly mistakes i highly recommend it and

00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:14,520
and then next steps so your next steps

00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:18,540
might be when you're learning a new

00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:21,600
language especially with Django they

00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:23,880
change the tutorial work tutorial so

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,840
that now it goes on to python anywhere

00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:29,490
and you might do that you might practice

00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,580
practice practice practice if that's

00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:34,620
what you need a highly recommend you do

00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,839
community contribution even if you're

00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:40,020
not coding you can always contribute to

00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:43,740
the documentation and it's usually the

00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:46,920
same process as submitting a patch and

00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:51,210
therefore you've learned a procedure

00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:54,990
that once you use code will be easy to

00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:57,480
implement build an app break stuff and

00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:00,510
then for me I'm going to go back to

00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,570
corona ghen and be a coach on September

00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,350
19th and I promised it would be to sleep

00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:09,240
deprived

00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:11,190
fly so what's really next actually is

00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:17,430
that I'm not coding in Django at all

00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:19,200
anymore whoo I went from being a django

00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:23,190
girls workshop participant to a red hat

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,350
software engineer in five months because

00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:28,170
I drank from the firehose approved

00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:30,540
myself and then I ended up getting hired

00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:32,760
to a different section of red hat that

00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,700
doesn't use Django at all they just

00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:38,040
cared that I'd know how to learn and so

00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,560
they don't care that I learned they

00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,960
don't care the language the python and

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,410
django and and actually i learned some

00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:48,630
rails they care that i learned fast and

00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:51,060
that's what a lot of people care about

00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,860
can you learn fast and then I know

00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:58,020
myself and therefore I know how to learn

00:11:52,860 --> 00:12:00,690
fast so now I code on OpenStack and my

00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:02,700
coat on I mean I contribute to the

00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:05,070
community because they just started on

00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,080
July sixth so I'm still just helping

00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:11,460
with the docks and doing a lot of

00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:14,690
reading and ramping up and that is how i

00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:17,910
used procedural knowledge to get from

00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:21,720
the workshop to red hat software

00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:23,130
engineer and now you can't you do have

00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,250
any questions would you like to go to

00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,250
lunch

00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:39,690
so back in the day um the companies were

00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,360
totally into this idea of having

00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,950
knowledge bases and one company I worked

00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,560
for had a chief knowledge officer whose

00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:49,530
duties were somewhat ill-defined and all

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,840
that kind of stuff so but the idea seems

00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:53,940
very sound what do you think of having

00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:57,300
company wide or group wide or

00:12:53,940 --> 00:13:01,050
organization-wide systems for organizing

00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:02,670
all this shared in intuitive group

00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:04,320
knowledge that people are otherwise just

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,480
keep you locked in their heads right we

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,810
do that actually and by we I mean red

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,730
hat in the support side and we're

00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,230
starting to integrate engineering

00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,220
actually a lot of people on the support

00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:18,450
side we're like you're going to

00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:21,360
engineering let's implement a basis we

00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:23,700
have SP RS which are especially based

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,310
routing so if I get that call and it's

00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,380
about cluster and I have no experience

00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:31,440
with cluster I get all the information I

00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:33,150
stay calm i learn the basics so that I

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,060
know what questions to ask the people

00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:39,200
that actually do know about cluster my

00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:41,490
specialty is satellite so when I have

00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,190
what I'm not answering the phone I then

00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:46,350
go over and help people that don't have

00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:49,500
any experience with satellite answer

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:52,080
their questions so we we do that and i

00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,030
highly recommend it um I actually think

00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:57,510
that's part of what open source is all

00:13:54,030 --> 00:14:07,470
about is here's my knowledge play with

00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:09,120
it go and we have time for other we have

00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,530
time for other questions the microphone

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,660
can come to you if you'd prefer not to

00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:19,940
come to the microphone don't be scared

00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:19,940
okay oh well

00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,680
hi thanks for the awesome talk and I was

00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:31,080
just going to ask following on from the

00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,740
first question do you think there's or

00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,700
how much value do you think there is to

00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:38,790
knowledge bases that are kind of

00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,200
descriptive versus maybe kind of

00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,640
tutorials and things that people can

00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,200
work through and like which would you

00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,500
recommend or do you think there needs to

00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,270
be a mix of both I say both actually and

00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,040
we have both we use both there are

00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:52,770
people that come on and they're like I

00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:56,040
need something very very specific I need

00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:59,460
to know how to set up a rel environment

00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:01,950
with a cluster using VMs and something

00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:05,340
very very specific and those might need

00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:08,610
a person to give the final a con but we

00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:11,370
have something to get you close and then

00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:14,220
we have tutorials and interactives that

00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:17,550
people never need to come call us

00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:22,560
because it's all the informations there

00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:25,380
and I I strongly I passionately feel

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,840
that if the if the knowledge is there

00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,970
then you can self help and that actually

00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:33,090
that's more important to teach people

00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:35,250
which is what this talk about is about

00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:37,440
actually I can teach you something all

00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:41,880
day long but you won't digest it until

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:45,270
you actually teach yourself and practice

00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:50,760
or whatever you need but if I'm I can

00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:58,730
talk all day but it won't stick so yeah

00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:58,730
both short answer anyone else

00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:10,790
so to build on that same question and

00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:12,350
your answer may be too proprietary and

00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:15,110
maybe the audience can help too but my

00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:17,450
team struggles with how best to share

00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:19,399
that knowledge with each other and with

00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:23,300
our future selves and and the tools

00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:25,519
we've chosen over time are varying and

00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,860
so does what advice do you have for how

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,440
best to share the tutorials the lessons

00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,060
learned the instruction manuals and not

00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,950
even specific documentation for an

00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:36,560
application but as a team business rules

00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:39,440
that change over time yes yeah yeah so

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,440
when I first started with redhat we were

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,990
very like all over like we the

00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,029
information and it still is I will be

00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:49,670
completely honest on the back end and

00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:51,709
the tooling there's like a million ways

00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:53,120
and it's kind of ugly to share

00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:55,459
information but you have to have a

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,829
really good search that can network with

00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:59,810
all of them and that helps and the other

00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:02,300
thing that we did was we built a portal

00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:04,970
that was a central location where

00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,760
customers and employees could both go

00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:10,990
and depending on your permission of

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:14,900
course you would be able to dive into

00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:18,079
more or less information so a customer

00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:20,270
we wouldn't want to give a raw issue

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,720
that we're working on that has other

00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:26,059
customers private information on but if

00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,220
there was another employee searching for

00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:30,770
that same problem we would want them to

00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,320
see that raw information because that

00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:37,010
might solve their problem and therefore

00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:39,290
they can help solve this problem so so

00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:42,730
it's it's double I would highly

00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:46,429
recommend an integrated search and then

00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:49,850
like integrating all your tools into one

00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:51,860
portal for example is what we did there

00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:54,530
might be other solution I'm sure there

00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:59,720
are but that's what we did thank you

00:17:54,530 --> 00:18:02,000
welcome this is my twitter handle if you

00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:05,150

remarks please feel free to shoot the

00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:11,100
mound over the twitter fear and i will
