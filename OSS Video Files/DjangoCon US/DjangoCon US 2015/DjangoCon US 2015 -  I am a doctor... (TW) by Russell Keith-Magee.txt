just as a prior warning on this talk in

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,640
the program it was flagged as a Content

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,859
warning in this talk I will be

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,840
discussing some fairly disturbing topics

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,000
for some people issues of depression

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,289
suicide suicidal thoughts drug use and

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,239
miscarriage will come up in the course

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:34,680
of this conversation so if that is

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,290
something that is likely to affect you

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,920
in a bad way then please be advised and

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,809
take whatever controls you need so my

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,940
name is Russell I am a 10-year veteran

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:47,039
of the Django core team I'm a member of

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,300
the Django Technical Advisory Board I'm

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,000
president of the Django software

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,739
foundation as you just heard I'm also

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,850
founded the B word projects project

00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:56,340
looking at the tools we use to develop

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,930
Python big part of beware is toda

00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,160
cross-platform widget toolkit that

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,129
allows you to build iOS and Android

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,840
mobile apps in Python beware and Tiger

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,820
both works in progress if you're

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,710
interested in Python development tools

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,460
or Python on mobile please come talk to

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:13,110
me I'm also the CTO and co-founder of a

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,409
startup company with all the pressures

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:19,920
and stresses that come along with that

00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:21,930
I'm also a doctor I'm not that kind of

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,299
doctor my doctorate is in computer

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,890
science my doctoral thesis was entitled

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,659
models of learning and development in

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,759
kohonen style self-organizing feature

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,159
maps and that's three and a half years

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,780
I'm not getting back

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:39,659
the reason I say this is what I'm about

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,090
to say is not medical advice it's

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,860
personal anecdote if you find yourself

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,909
being affected by any of the problems

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,490
that I'm about to start discussing

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,369
please seek professional help

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,409
don't rely upon me because I'm not the

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:54,090
professional my hope though is the by

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,560
sharing what I've been going through I

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,850
hope you encourage others to go and do

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,780
something that I didn't do for a very

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:03,030
very long time you may have noticed that

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,220
I have my fingers in a lot of pies I

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,140
have a stressful job I volunteer with

00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:09,899
Django I've got side projects my side

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,979
projects have side projects I have a son

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,480
I also have a son with learning

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,099
difficulties I have a daughter I have a

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,599
wife and in the last few years the

00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:19,620
combination of the stresses of all of

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,599
these started to take its toll my temper

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,640
started to grow short I found myself

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,160
getting really frustrated both with

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,040
myself and with others I found myself

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,840
genuinely doubting my own oblique my own

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,970
abilities not just impostor syndrome

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,940
level stuff I'm talking a genuine belief

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:37,590
that I was incompetent my enthusiasm to

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,049
go out and socialize with friends was

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,180
almost completely removed picking up the

00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:43,739
phone to call a friend to go over for

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,930
dinner or to have them over for dinner

00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:48,269
felt like just too much effort to even

00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,579
be worth it I also had some intermittent

00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:52,859
health problems in particular I started

00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:54,480
having real issues with my back and

00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:55,769
shoulder on back muscles to the extent

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,420
that I was spending sometimes three or

00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:00,260
four days laid out on the couch doped up

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,340
and some really really great opiates but

00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:05,850
long-term that's not a burden on a

00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:08,160
productive situation it wasn't constant

00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:10,139
it wasn't a continuous decline I had

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,810
good days I had bad days I had good

00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:15,060
weeks I had bad weeks but this pattern

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,280
had probably been going on in a serious

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,549
way for 18 months and probably even four

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:24,150
years before that but in early this May

00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:26,340
I hit rock bottom for about a week I

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,200
would wake up in the morning and the

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:32,340
only thing that got me out of bed was

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,139
habit I felt absolutely no joy in what I

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,060
was doing in my anything in my life the

00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:38,160
only reason I was getting out of bed was

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,630
habit and contractual obligation the

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,790
fact that my new my kids needed to be

00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:45,660
fed so I suppose I'd better get out of

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:48,780
bed then and then one Wednesday I

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:51,270
into my office I started work and by

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,080
about 9:30 I just had no energy to

00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,510
continue

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,170
I couldn't summon the energy to give a

00:03:54,510 --> 00:04:00,420
damn about anything I went back to bed

00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:03,900
I buried my head in my pillow and I

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:06,000
cried that was the final straw for my

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,910
wife she pushed me out the door to go

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,440
see a doctor a medical one and I was

00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:13,650
diagnosed as being in the middle of a

00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,840
major depressive episode now I am being

00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,160
treated now I am relatively speaking at

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,890
the start of my treatment so it's way

00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,299
too early for me to declare victory but

00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,980
even in this short time the last couple

00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:25,830
of months I've noticed a huge positive

00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:27,450
change at some level it's probably just

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,700
the cathartic release of knowing that

00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:32,280
what I was feeling wasn't right and can

00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,240
be treated but frankly at this point I

00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,170
would at that point I would have taken

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,940
any improvement I could get the reason

00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:41,250
I'm going public is because in

00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,020
retrospect I put off getting help for

00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:46,170
far too long

00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,970
I didn't want to admit failure I didn't

00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,790
want to attract the stigma of admitting

00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:54,030
that I was mentally ill I didn't want to

00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:56,190
see a doctor because of pride successful

00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:58,290
people don't get depressed successful

00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:02,979
people power through successful people

00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:05,840
win and that's bull

00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:07,729
studies universally agree the depression

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,110
affects at least one in ten people in

00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:11,210
the general population and it's higher

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,949
in some demographics and guess what this

00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,419
is one of those demographics computers

00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:16,340
computer science and programming people

00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:18,110
our industry is particularly prone to

00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:22,009
the tune that discussions of burnout are

00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:24,949
almost a constant undertone I want every

00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:27,919
single person in this room to know that

00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:29,990
you're not alone I am by almost every

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,849
conceivable measure I can see a

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:35,840
successful member of this community and

00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:37,250
I have depression now I've given a

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,389
version of this Turkish as a lightning

00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,370
talk twice now

00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:42,710
once at Jenga corn Europe when I sort of

00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:44,180
came out as it were and once it parked

00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,039
on Australia about a month ago and what

00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,449
is amazed me is that both times the

00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:49,940
number of people who have sought me out

00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:52,039
afterwards to thank me about being so

00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,690
open because they had depression but

00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:54,770
they were free to seek treatment or they

00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,060
had sought treatment but they didn't

00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:59,330
want to tell anyone about it because of

00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:02,500
the shame and it's the shame that is

00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:05,090
quite literally in some cases killing us

00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,820
and when I say us I mean that quite

00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:12,020
literally people who could've should

00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:13,729
have been in this room today aren't men

00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,199
over 10 years ago Django received some

00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:16,460
contributions from some runner from this

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,650
little 19 year old guy named Aaron

00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,330
Schwartz you may know him from some of

00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,800
his other projects Redditch marked down

00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,630
his Activision work on SOPA

00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,070
I'll never met Aaron myself and at the

00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,389
time I certainly didn't recognize him

00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,580
for the intellectual powerhouse that he

00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:30,349
was he was someone who contributed to

00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,030
the discussions about Django's ORM he

00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:34,039
was a major contributor to the magic

00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,990
removal discussions and the model that

00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:37,580
objects top filter API design we have

00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,009
today is at least partially due to some

00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,719
of his feedback

00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:43,159
now Django never really stuck for Aaron

00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:44,479
he was too much of an independent spirit

00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:46,490
he went off and started his own web

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,139
framework web drop by and about two

00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,699
years after he was engaged with the

00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:52,190
Django community actively Aaron wrote a

00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:54,590
blog post and in that blog post he said

00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:56,479
the following I have a lot of illnesses

00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,849
I don't talk about it much for a variety

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,550
of reasons I feel ashamed to have an

00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:03,889
illness surely they've been times when

00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,060
you've been sad perhaps a loved one has

00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:07,130
abandoned you or a plan has gone

00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,199
horribly awry your face Falls perhaps

00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,940
you cry you feel worthless you wonder

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,560
whether it's worth going on everything

00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,089
you think you think about seems bleak

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,960
the things you've done the things you

00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:17,000
hope to do the PIPA

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,639
around you you want to lie in bed and

00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,410
turn the lights off depressed mood is

00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,650
like that only it doesn't come for any

00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:25,849
reason and it doesn't go for any either

00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:27,020
go outside and get some fresh air or

00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:29,300
cuddle up with a loved one you don't

00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,220
feel any better only more upset at being

00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,349
unable to fill the jury that everyone

00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:37,099
else seems to feel everything gets

00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:40,849
colored by the sadness and then in 2013

00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:42,919
Aaron took his own life now it's really

00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:44,780
easy to reduce this to saying that the

00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:46,310
Aaron was killed by the US Attorney he

00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,650
was mercilessly going after him for no

00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:50,270
good reason and to be sure malicious

00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,550
prosecution was part of what contributed

00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,530
to his situation but that wasn't why

00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:57,169
Aaron took his own life he took his life

00:07:54,530 --> 00:08:00,050
because he was depressed and when you're

00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:03,440
depressed thoughts of self-harm start

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:05,030
sounding like a good idea and the thing

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,190
is other people actually noticed this

00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:09,259
happening at least after his list and

00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,789
abroad said I knew he was struggling but

00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:12,380
he was also a passionate activist and I

00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:16,130
genuinely thought that we would see him

00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:18,050
through this dark period this isn't

00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:20,750
something we can ignore or hope that

00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:24,289
will go away this is as I said quite

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,909
literally killing us an Aaron's story

00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:27,770
isn't unique over the last two years

00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:29,240
I've had conversations with at least two

00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,919
other prominent jangan oughts

00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,270
who have told me that they've been in

00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:36,079
positions where they've seriously

00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:38,060
considered self-harm I didn't ever meet

00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:40,729
meet Aaron but we do actually have a

00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:43,339
connection we share a birthday he's

00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:45,200
exactly 10 years younger than me now

00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:46,820
that's a really really dumb thing to

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,200
fixate on on the ground scheme of things

00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,950
but when I found that out that hit me

00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,870
really hard the upside of that shock is

00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,550
that I'm gonna be damned if I'm gonna

00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:57,920
let any member of this community that I

00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,120
love so much fall by the wayside over

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,930
something as simple as making sure

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,959
they're okay my plea to each and every

00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:08,209
one of you don't ignore the science

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,010
don't put off getting help if you've

00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:11,600
even got a vague feeling that you might

00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:14,750
be depressed or suffering from burnout

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,370
please seek help because you don't have

00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:20,899
to feel like this denying you have a

00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:22,610
problem won't make it any better so ok

00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:24,920
you've accepted you need help what does

00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:28,280
help look like well first off it's

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,630
important to get a good diagnosis if

00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,360
looking to just kind of put your toes in

00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:34,340
the water you can do some of these tests

00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,960
online one example is the k10 test for

00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,880
psychological distress it's a bit like

00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,660
one of those which superhero are you pop

00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:43,040
quizzes but you know for reals

00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,720
but pop quizzes ultimately are no

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,190
substitute for real diagnosis and

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,700
there's no way to sugarcoat this you're

00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:51,050
going to need to see a professional

00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,370
they're going to administer some tests

00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,560
and some of them are actually very

00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:57,320
similar to the k10 test and work out

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,790
exactly what you've got because to that

00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,950
end it's important to recognize that

00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:02,840
depression is very much a blanket term

00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:04,130
there are lots of different types of

00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,590
depression and lots of different types

00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:07,520
of mental illness I was diagnosed as

00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,890
being in the middle of a major

00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,480
depressive episode my son who is nine

00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:13,880
has what's called generalized anxiety

00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,620
disorder some women get postpartum

00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:19,190
depression after giving birth or after a

00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:22,280
miscarriage many of the symptoms of

00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,900
these illnesses are similar and many of

00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,980
the treatments are similar as well but

00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,750
it's very important to get a good

00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,880
diagnosis because while they're similar

00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,610
they are distinct and the differences

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,480
matter when it comes to treatment and

00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,400
sometimes just to complicate matters

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,790
they are comorbid you can have both

00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,960
depression and an anxiety disorder so

00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:40,370
what does treatment look like well it

00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,870
can take a bunch of different forms and

00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:44,360
they're not mutually exclusive you can

00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:46,400
do many of them at once as I said

00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,680
earlier I'm now taking medication for my

00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,030
depression in modern Western society

00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,710
this is awful obviously one of the big

00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:54,800
first ports of call one pill makes you

00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:56,660
bigger one pill makes you small but be

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,390
wary of thinking that a magic pill will

00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,580
fix all your problems it won't but it

00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:03,800
can help you manage symptoms if what you

00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,420
have is episodic it can give you a brain

00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,330
that kickstart it needs to start

00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:10,190
producing the right chemicals again some

00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:12,830
of them don't even need to be prescribed

00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:14,420
some John's wort is a horrible extract

00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,740
it's available at health food shops in

00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,900
Australia I presume it's the same in the

00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,650
u.s. it's a very very mild

00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,790
antidepressant but it's strong enough

00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:24,790
that if you start taking something

00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:27,530
prescribed a prescribed antidepressant

00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:29,120
it's contraindicated they say stop

00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:30,860
taking some John's wort for a couple of

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,200
days before you start taking these other

00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,940
drugs I used some John's weren't around

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,459
for several years before I moved to the

00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:40,610
hard stuff and it actually was hopeful

00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:41,630
during that period melatonin is another

00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,080
supplement that's available without

00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,880
prescription

00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,290
melatonin is a hormone that's important

00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,790
for regulating your body clock and some

00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:48,290
studies have found that people suffering

00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,890
from depression have low melatonin in

00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,140
their systems

00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:52,459
now supplements may help however for

00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:56,450
some people taking melatonin actually

00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:58,130
induces depression so be careful and one

00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:00,440
thing I will say though is even if there

00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:02,720
things are even remotely serious do not

00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,510
rely on self medication seek

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,820
professional advice I mentioned those

00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:09,200
two as simple things you can try if it's

00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:12,709
not that bad

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,720
maybe you need a little bit of help also

00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:16,610
keep an eye out for other forms of self

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,760
medication in particular alcohol and

00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:21,529
drug use it's really really easy to slip

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,899
into the habit of getting drunk until

00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:26,750
you can't feel feelings anymore but

00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:28,910
that's not helping in fact it's part of

00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,550
the problem it's even used as a

00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:33,470
diagnostic criterion the same goes for

00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:35,120
illicit drugs I never took a list of

00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:37,100
drugs myself other than some really

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,760
really fine opiates for the codeine for

00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:42,769
the back pain but I know people have and

00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,990
again it's a mask for the real problem

00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:46,550
if you start noticing a pattern of

00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,800
excessive alcohol or drug use in

00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:52,520
yourself seek help and if you see it in

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,260
others intervene now of course the hard

00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,209
stuff is the prescription medication

00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:58,550
broadly the category of drugs used to

00:12:56,209 --> 00:13:00,860
manage depression is generally the SSRIs

00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:03,110
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors

00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,970
there are several of these on the market

00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,990
they all work fundamentally the same way

00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:08,120
they have slightly different

00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:10,459
metabolization processes some work for

00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,350
some people don't work for others white

00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:14,089
eggs are left and I was really lucky it

00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:16,190
worked first time for me and the effect

00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:18,680
was both profound and quick a matter of

00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:20,720
days for some people it can take weeks

00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,730
and for some people it doesn't work at

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,529
all

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,029
if you ant issues a more anxiety elated

00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:27,279
you might be prescribed an SSR all you

00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:29,000
might be pointed in the direction of

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,050
benzodiazepine they work in a very

00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,190
similar kind of way

00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,050
that's only work at work at a different

00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,310
way now they're much better at an

00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,990
intermediate straight an immediate

00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,790
treatment for onset anxiety syndrome

00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:40,000
symptoms rather than SSRIs which need a

00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:42,230
baseline blood concentration to work

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,820
dosage is also very important when I

00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:45,769
started I was on about half the dose

00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,779
that I am now and while they did have a

00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:48,880
very dramatic effect on my mood I found

00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:50,930
that I was sitting on the couch

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,820
completely calm and relaxed

00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:55,939
with my shoulders tensed up around my

00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:58,039
neck all day strangely increasing

00:13:55,939 --> 00:13:59,689
actually made that go away now you have

00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:03,559
to work with your doctor on this to dial

00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:05,179
in the right dosage SSRIs also have some

00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:08,269
very interesting side effects ranging

00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:10,879
from the awkward to the potentially

00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:11,989
dangerous they also have some very

00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:13,279
interesting interactions with other

00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:15,949
commonly used medications especially

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:19,209
aspirin aspirin and codeine so again my

00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:21,979
good friends codeine has all gone away

00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:24,379
treatment doesn't just mean drugs though

00:14:21,979 --> 00:14:27,439
there is a lot you can and should do

00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:29,419
without even popping a pill get exercise

00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:31,819
now having me up here advocating

00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:34,519
exercise is more than a little

00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:35,929
hypocritical but I should get a lot more

00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:37,220
than I do but from a depression

00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:39,589
management point of view it doesn't even

00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,389
need to be vigorous exercise even taking

00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:43,129
a 30-minute walk each day can be enough

00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:45,889
and frankly just clearing your head can

00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:47,269
be a wonderful thing part of the

00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:49,489
advantage of taking a walk is getting

00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:50,899
some sunshine exposure to spend sunlight

00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:52,279
stimulates vitamin D production which

00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:53,569
plays in the melatonin production which

00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:55,699
is the whole of a bunch of chemical

00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:56,809
processes now this can be a problem for

00:14:55,699 --> 00:14:58,339
other reasons there isn't enough

00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:59,599
sunlight at some latitudes in Australia

00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:01,099
the Sun is actually trying to kill you

00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:05,749
thank you very much the northern

00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:07,759
hemisphere for that you can also think

00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:09,619
that seek out therapy as with the family

00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,299
pharmacological solutions there are many

00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:14,029
different forms of therapy as well two

00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:15,709
common ones that come up in in in in

00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:16,999
discussions are cognitive behavioral

00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:19,369
therapy and acceptance and commitment

00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:21,109
therapy which one's work for you will

00:15:19,369 --> 00:15:23,929
depend very much upon your own headspace

00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:25,759
and how you tackle problems it's not one

00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:26,959
size fits all if you go to a therapist

00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:28,009
and that therapist doesn't seem to be

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,159
working for you seek out another

00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:33,470
therapist it doesn't need to be

00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:35,689
professional help either just talking to

00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,029
a friend can be helpful burden shared is

00:15:35,689 --> 00:15:39,319
a burden halved

00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:40,819
there are also some voluntary groups out

00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:43,220
there in the coda developer space

00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:44,839
specifically there's MH prompt blue

00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,549
hackers there's also a group with wider

00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:48,279
focus like beyond blue and black dog

00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:50,419
Institute or two that are in Australia

00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:51,889
but much of the information that is

00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:53,899
there is applicable regardless of

00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:55,609
nationality the US Department of Health

00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:57,259
and Human Services also has mental

00:15:55,609 --> 00:16:00,319
health dogs that provide some us-centric

00:15:57,259 --> 00:16:01,519
information and if you're not the not

00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:04,100
depressed if you're a well-adjusted

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,449
happy individual well first off you're

00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:09,329
here so liars

00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:11,129
but seriously an incredibly happy for

00:16:09,329 --> 00:16:14,069
you your job now is to make sure that

00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:15,959
everyone else around you is okay if

00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:17,369
you've never been depressed it may be

00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:19,109
very difficult to understand exactly

00:16:17,369 --> 00:16:21,089
what's going on so let's be clear about

00:16:19,109 --> 00:16:25,679
what depression is and what depression

00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:27,509
isn't depression isn't being sad it's

00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,509
not something you can just snap out off

00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:33,389
it is all in your head but it's not just

00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:37,739
a frame of mind or a mood it's the brain

00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:38,999
being broken and broken limbs broken

00:16:37,739 --> 00:16:40,679
parts of your body actually a really

00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:43,259
good analogy here if I was to break my

00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:44,970
leg no one would tell me to shake it off

00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:48,660
have you considered not having a broken

00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:50,369
leg everybody gets you know broken leg

00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,559
sometimes no you'd understand that it's

00:16:50,369 --> 00:16:54,149
painful a bone has actually been broken

00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:55,859
I'm going to need to use a crutch for a

00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:57,569
little while to get me around or you

00:16:55,859 --> 00:16:59,369
might need to hold some doors open for

00:16:57,569 --> 00:17:00,540
me for a bit and you know I might be

00:16:59,369 --> 00:17:01,410
wrong I'm doing that you've hope I'm

00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,089
probably not gonna get a go

00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:04,889
bungee-jumping with you and if it's a

00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:06,179
particularly bad break I might not ever

00:17:04,889 --> 00:17:08,250
be able to review in some of the

00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:10,110
activities that I once enjoyed if

00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,669
someone around you says they have

00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:14,610
depression they're not saying they're

00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:17,549
sad they're saying that brain is broken

00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:20,880
and they need your help assistance and

00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:22,230
understanding to heal another analogy

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,059
that's helpful in explaining mental

00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,130
illnesses is what's called spoon theory

00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:28,289
whereas spoon theory was first described

00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:29,940
by Christine mr. Andy Oh mr. Andy knows

00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:31,620
she was using it in the context of

00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,330
having lupus but it's actually an

00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,190
analogy that holds for many disabilities

00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:37,889
including mental illness particularly

00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:39,299
things like anxiety disorders spoon

00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:41,429
theory grows something like this imagine

00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:43,289
you have in your hand a handful of 20

00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:45,870
spoons and they're the only cutlery you

00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:46,519
can use to eat all day when you use one

00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,870
you throw it away

00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:50,669
now you have to eat three times a day

00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:52,440
sometimes it's nice to have a snack so

00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:54,269
for happy life you need at least three

00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,429
and maybe five spoons would be nice to

00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:58,139
have but every time you do something

00:17:56,429 --> 00:18:00,389
challenging during your day it costs you

00:17:58,139 --> 00:18:01,380
a spoon to resolve that challenge you

00:18:00,389 --> 00:18:02,909
have an argument with your boss that

00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,440
costs a spoon you need to adapt to a

00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:06,000
last-minute change of plans that costs a

00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,220
spoon now if you're a well-adjusted

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,960
individual you've got 15 spare spoons

00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,070
even on your worst day it's hard to

00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,240
think that you might use up all those

00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:15,450
spoons you'll still be eating three

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,470
squares and two snacks but if you're

00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,480
going through life with a major

00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,380
disability or a major mental illness you

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,050
don't have

00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:24,660
fifteen spare spoons getting out of bed

00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:26,240
costs your spoon dealing with the fact

00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:30,150
that your son has just lost his shoes

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,500
again that costs a spoon getting out of

00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,410
your house in the morning can cost you

00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,930
half your spoon supply so you spend your

00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:38,250
entire day rationing your spoons making

00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:40,610
decisions about the things you can and

00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:44,520
can't do even though you'd like to and

00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:46,380
that cost spoons sometimes you can

00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,760
borrow spoons from tomorrow but then

00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,590
you're starting tomorrow was spoon down

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,060
and unexpected things always happen so

00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:53,730
you need to have a couple of spoons in

00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:55,200
reserve that's why some of the things

00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,330
that you may want to send to someone

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,610
with depression just aren't hopeful

00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:02,880
they're not even long they completely

00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:04,590
miss the nature of the problem saying it

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,030
will all get better you don't have it so

00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,580
bad there's always someone worse off

00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:11,610
than you stop being so negative they're

00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,560
not even wrong this isn't about feelings

00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:16,760
it's about a major mental condition it's

00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:18,960
about someone's brain being broken

00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,790
another thing to avoid is making light

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,550
of the situation casually referring to a

00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,480
desire to have a neat desk as being OCD

00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:25,530
calling out something slightly unusual

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,180
is crazy

00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,700
be well a lot of people out there who

00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,060
have actual OCD and it's not a joking

00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,160
matter

00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:35,400
there are people out there with serious

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,170
mental illnesses reducing everyone with

00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,630
a mental illness to a punch line is

00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:43,710
really no better than reducing all women

00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:46,260
to sex objects so what can you do well

00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,400
be there for people if it looks as

00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:50,040
though someone might be having a bad

00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:52,470
time be there for them ask if they're

00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:55,470
okay they might not want to talk about

00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:58,650
it but they might and even if they don't

00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:01,170
having someone ask is a sign that you're

00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:03,030
connected to the world and that can be a

00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:06,660
really big thing when you're in a dark

00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:09,120
hole also except that you're not going

00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,710
to fix them a five minute chat about

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,720
someone's problems isn't going to make

00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:15,540
their depression go away any more than

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:19,680
it would fix their broken leg you are at

00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:21,180
best going to give them a spoon back now

00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,800
sometimes it's also going to mean taking

00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,210
charge of the situation one of the big

00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,460
symptoms for me that I mentioned is that

00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:28,530
I lost all enthusiasm for organizing

00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,910
social outings the effort involved in

00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,990
picking up the phone and suggesting hey

00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,240
maybe we should have a picture in watch

00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:36,990
a movie was a spoon I didn't

00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,340
have but you can provide that spoon if

00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,570
someone said hey I want to come over

00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,830
what little Pixar watch a movie I

00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,450
probably would have done it because

00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,130
connecting with friends makes you feel

00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:46,050
good and I would have done me the

00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:48,020
world's good to get out and someone talk

00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:50,790
to someone about what was going on and

00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:52,440
so you might need to the long lightly

00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:54,720
shove someone out the door make it as

00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,880
easy as possible as spoon cheap as

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,730
possible for them to do something that's

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,800
good for them and it also doesn't mean

00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:03,810
you spend an evening playing therapist

00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,010
it just means an evening of taking

00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:06,600
someone's mind off things

00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:08,430
it's not come out and talk about your

00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,470
problems it's come out and be with us

00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:14,340
come out and connect with us come out

00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:15,780
and be human with us so that's all I've

00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,130
got to say I'm sorry for being such a

00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,090
download I what the end at the end of

00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,380
what has been such a fantastic

00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:23,700
conference so here's a picture of a

00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:26,550
kitty the reason I've done this is

00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,710
because I suffer from depression and I

00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:33,060
put off getting help for far too long

00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:36,600
the reasons I did that are in retrospect

00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:40,620
more numbing lead um and they're really

00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:42,990
easy to fix we need to talk about this I

00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,940
love this community I love everyone

00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:46,620
that's in it and I don't want to think

00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:50,550
that someone else is going through what

00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:54,210
I went through when it can be treated it

00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:56,100
can get better we just have to care

00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:59,070
about one another and break the stigma

00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:01,410
that makes people ashamed to admit that

00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:03,560
they've got a problem thank you very

00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,560
