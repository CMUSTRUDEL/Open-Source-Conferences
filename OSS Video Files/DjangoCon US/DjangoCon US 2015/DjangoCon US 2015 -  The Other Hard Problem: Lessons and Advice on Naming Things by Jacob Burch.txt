	The Other Hard Problem: Lessons and Advice on Naming Things

There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things. -- Phil Karlton

This quote finds its way into many-a-talk about caching systems (including my own), and sometimes we as developers will recall it when we spend an hour to name that one nebulous variable. But why is something so difficult as nomenclature also thought of as too simple to actually talk about?

In this talk, I'll review what has been written in the last few decades on naming, go over the easy parts of right or wrong as defined in PEP8 and other style guidelines, and finally suggest some patterns and anti-patterns found in in today's Django and open source environment for us to adopt (or avoid!) in our everyday naming of variables, libraries and other "things".

Lizzy Williams gave a talk yesterday on

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:25,590
the intersection between humanities and

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,930
Technology specifically how her lessons

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,330
as an English major influence and helped

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,300
her life in the tech world I'm an

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:36,480
English major as well and as soon as I

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,940
saw her abstract I knew there was going

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,930
to be a pretty big intersection between

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:45,480
our talks so we talked and plotted

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,250
things out and the core lesson that I

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,809
kind of want to take from her is that

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:55,079
there are soft problems soft and

00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:56,670
technology that we can use lessons from

00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,050
from writer's lessons from your English

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,090
professor lessons from your high school

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,520
English teacher to make us better

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,170
programmers if you didn't catch your

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,520
talk please put at the top of your list

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:11,549
of to rewatch once the videos on demand

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,710
go up it was a wonderful talk I think a

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,509
lot of people I think people both from

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,009
humanities majors and people who from

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,650
sort of more technical backgrounds have

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,030
a lot to learn from it but again the

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,729
core listen I want to take away is that

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,310
there are hard problems in computer

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:29,310
science that are maybe not solved but

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,920
aided by some lessons we can take from

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:37,619
humanities and the problem that I want

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:39,450
to talk about is names names of

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,780
variables means the methods names of

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:45,240
projects like like the cell allistic

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,250
guides that lacy covered yesterday names

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,670
are important because they're what we

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:54,299
leave behind as signposts to fellow

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,860
developers both current developers

00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,229
people work your current co-workers

00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,869
people who may work with you later and

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:03,090
you one year from now you will want

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:05,610
yourself your old self to have named

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,500
things correctly if you do not future

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,840
you will be mad at you and that is how

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,800
time-travel movies start

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,840
and you do not want to be the

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,580
protagonist in that movie I promise you

00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,080
now there are other reasons why you want

00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,640
to have good barrel names other than to

00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,400
avoid being killed by yourself and

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,660
causing some sort of conflict but we'll

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,170
go into those kind of when we get into

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:30,150
the actual advice later in the talk

00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,459
speaking in in my name is Jacob Burch

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,880
the name of the company I work for is

00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:38,220
red assist the name of my title is

00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,890
developer I guess and the name of this

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,420
talk is the other hard problem a lot of

00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,580
you probably know what the name of the

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,590
talk is referring to there's a quote

00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,080
that gets battled around I used it and

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:52,380
talk here at changuk on three or four

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,390
years ago when I gave a talk on catchin

00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,640
validation and cashing within Jango with

00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:59,280
my cobras and Arno Silas so here's that

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,380
quote there are only two hard things in

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,410
computer science cache invalidation and

00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,489
naming things

00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,660
no there are other sort of jokey

00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:09,450
versions of this but this is the one

00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,680
that matters and it's funny on in its

00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,239
own right right because you have this

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,820
super super technical thing cache

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,170
invalidation hard CS grads have a really

00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,850
hard time with it and you have this

00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,549
super soft problem in naming variables

00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:22,019
and that's why it's kind of funny that

00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:25,650
the two polar opposites of our

00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:27,720
discipline still are the highest highest

00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,930
in difficulty at least at least

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,450
according this quote and I'm grateful

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,040
for that because that means my American

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,510
literature degree was not gone to waste

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,359
I can use it in my professional life

00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,459
even if it's just to give this talk one

00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:43,200
or two times so let's go everyone I'm

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,810
gonna be talking about this is a novice

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,170
level course so a lot of things I'll be

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:51,090
saying may seem self-evident to some

00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,500
seasoned developers here but I kind of

00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,090
want to stress and I'll be stre

00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,040
stressing this throughout that a lot of

00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,019
the mistakes here are not mistakes of

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,269
ignorance there are mistakes of laziness

00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:01,709
it's easy to do the easy thing and just

00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:04,260
move on with your life even if you know

00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:07,079
better that said I do think this is sort

00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,430
of a step to talk and that it's not I

00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:09,989
expect you to have a little bit of

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,670
background on Pepe maybe you went to

00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:14,069
Lacey's talk maybe you've read the Pepe

00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,840
talks that's it I'll cover pep eight a

00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:17,310
little bit we have a special guest

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,269
instructor that all introduce in a

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,789
little bit who's going to give us some

00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,620
tips on naming our variables and then I

00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:23,639
have a few notes just on how we can take

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:29,580
these lessons and apply

00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:31,590
to our tests and documentation so to

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,360
start up something up f8 I want to

00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,039
actually quote verbatim from Lacey's

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,550
talk she's talking about the elements of

00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:37,919
style

00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:40,439
the English style guide by Strunk and

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,419
white the broader point of about Strunk

00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,490
and white though is that this is a guide

00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:46,800
written to help people write clear more

00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,460
concise more consistent more readable

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,560
English

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,479
pepÃ© tis a guide for helping people

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,550
write clearer more concise more

00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:55,499
consistent and more readable code and

00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,389
that bears repeating because it works

00:04:55,499 --> 00:04:59,340
exactly the same for names the point of

00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:01,919
our names are these signposts and we

00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:06,029
want them to be clear more concise more

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,469
consistent and more readable so I'm

00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:09,270
gonna like I said really breeze through

00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:12,330
Pepe and what it has to say about naming

00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:13,949
variables even if you haven't read Pepe

00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,930
I think a lot of these are apparent if

00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:17,370
you just read a little bit of Python

00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,370
code that's been written in the last few

00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,800
years or less decade we all upper

00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,509
camelcase are class names we lowercase

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,400
and underscore are variable names in our

00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:28,050
method names and our function names and

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,770
we shout at the top of our lungs are

00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:32,779
constant names there's a few slightly

00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:38,580
lesser-known

00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:40,080
advice as well we add a one underscore

00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,759
when we want to kind of suggest that

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,439
this is a private method that may may or

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,629
may not get maintained we can add a

00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,669
double underscore to reinforce the idea

00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:49,860
that it's a private method and Python

00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:51,689
will invoke some name mangling again I

00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,419
read Pepe to learn more about that and

00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:57,149
if you're sort of hugged by a double

00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:58,710
underscores and know it's a magic method

00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:02,610
that's used somewhere else in the life

00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:05,729
of the class those are guests this is

00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:07,789
our guest host Mark Twain so I picked

00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:12,389
rain for a reason

00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:15,240
just move the mic so Lacey had jane

00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:16,949
austen helping us guide us through tests

00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,629
and through Pepe and through the imports

00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:22,469
and style guide and I picked Mark Twain

00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:25,319
for a number of reasons first is he's an

00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:27,960
American master to kind of compose go

00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:32,159
against the juxtapose the British nature

00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:34,949
background of Jane Austen he is a known

00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:37,230
for his simple elegant straightforward

00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:40,290
style so I think we can all appreciate

00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:42,060
Denyce does he has a really mean face I

00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,620
don't know I do not know if there's a

00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:47,130
picture of him smiling there's pictures

00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,870
of him as a baby he is not smiling and

00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,250
he looks like a guy if he's doing a

00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,380
cobra view with him you don't want to

00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,820
tick him off like this is a guy he will

00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,550
have vengeance on you if you have a bad

00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:59,430
variable name but the main reason I

00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:02,400
picked Mark Twain is he hated Jane

00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:04,920
Austen that I I'm not I'm not kidding

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,330
about this and I'm not gonna say any of

00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,220
the mean things that he said about Jane

00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:12,120
Austen because I would just be mean and

00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:14,070
cruel and I'm above that but he I kind

00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:20,160
of want to I kind of want to try to fix

00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:25,680
this there are more if you google Jane

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:27,840
Austen Mark Twain he's not a fan but I

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,000
want to fix this I want in real Jane

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,460
Austen style I want to marry off me

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,070
Knoll Mark Twain to Jane Austen

00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:38,280
arm-in-arm and have them guide us to a

00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:40,940
nirvana of Python naming and help have

00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,170
them both help us in both aspects of it

00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,780
so the first bit of advice that Mark

00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:48,240
Twain has for us is use plain simple

00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,580
language and short words this is easy

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,650
right like we can directly use this in

00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,650
as advice' naming our variables

00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,370
yesterday at the there was a comment at

00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,540
the end of Lacey's talk because I was

00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:05,310
trying to think of an example to show

00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:08,640
like what not to do what violates this

00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:10,740
and there was a comment about not using

00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,450
docstrings as your method name which is

00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,140
brilliant that's exactly how I want to

00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:17,580
put it so this is a good example of that

00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:20,220
so this is a hyperbolic example you see

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,890
this and you think I would never do that

00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,770
that's not me I know better I use nice

00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:27,450
concise descriptive language and that's

00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:29,370
true like this is a very silly example

00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:33,210
but I think there's another bit of

00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:36,180
advice where maybe we do fall into that

00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:37,470
trap we don't even notice it this is one

00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,570
of the more well-known Mark Twain

00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:41,240
writing devices which is when you catch

00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:43,590
an adjective kill it

00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,420
nouns verbs these are the building

00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:47,550
blocks and very very sparsely should you

00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,960
be using adjectives and we read this and

00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,760
like well this doesn't translate to

00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,730
programming right we don't use really

00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,470
maybe properties maybe arguments but for

00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:58,680
the most part nouns and verbs is kind of

00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:02,040
what we stick to but I disagree so look

00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:05,579
at this model name and that's now now

00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:08,459
noun in this case but we're using user

00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:10,170
and vote as adjectives and it would be

00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:13,680
so much better if we just had one word

00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:17,100
to convey this and there's a couple of

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,230
techniques I want you to use when it

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,760
comes to fixing this first I guess three

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,690
because the first is when you notice

00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,269
that you're doing this you're just

00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:26,399
shoving words together to create a new

00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:26,880
class I just want a bell to go off in

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,680
your head

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,180
doesn't mean you need to fix it doesn't

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,010
mean there's something wrong it doesn't

00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,839
mean it's a bad variable name but it

00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:36,810
means there's an opportunity here to be

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,430
better and to be more concise the first

00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,889
technique we can use to actually fix it

00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:43,050
is what if we just got rid of one of the

00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:45,420
words do we lose in the actual meaning I

00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:47,730
find this happens a lot within models

00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,279
and especially with the user model so

00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:52,110
many things are related to the user so

00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:55,110
we add user to it but there's no such

00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:57,269
thing in this case as a non user vote

00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:00,630
collection so if we just get rid of the

00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:02,430
user we have just as valid just as

00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:05,250
descriptive but a little bit shorter and

00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:07,079
it matters when you start adding manager

00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,899
to things and view two things really

00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:11,250
helps the code stay concise there's

00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:12,750
another technique that's not quite as

00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,819
easy as just chopping something off and

00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,730
that's if you can combine two or more

00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:20,040
words to me to one single word different

00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,899
word somewhere in the dictionary of all

00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,029
of the thousands and thousand in English

00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:25,170
words that means the same thing now this

00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:27,389
is harder because it's a problem

00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:29,970
vocabulary sometimes you can't just

00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:31,500
google that there's a new word and even

00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:34,740
if there is a different word doesn't

00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,240
mean you should use it if it's a word

00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,709
that's not kind of widely understood by

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,569
the people you're coding with you still

00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:41,940
shouldn't use it luckily for us VOC

00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:43,529
collection in this mythical model that

00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,990
we're using there's another word when

00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:47,430
you just call it ballot I mean this is

00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,720
probably of all the examples I have

00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,730
ining this is a thing that the most

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,800
people don't do because it's hard you

00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,850
have to think you have to put it you

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,250
don't even have to think that much you

00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,660
have to put in the effort to Google like

00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:01,100
is there a domain word that I'm not

00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,100
thinking of that I could be using

00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:12,500
so I'm going to go back to that last bit

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,850
advice that Twain had for us because

00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,530
this is actually not the complete quote

00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:17,000
when it gets quoted this is usually all

00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:19,130
you see but it's not the complete one

00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,050
this is the complete one when you catch

00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:22,700
an ad you to kill it no I don't mean

00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:25,340
that audibly but kill most of them the

00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,190
rest of them will be valuable and this

00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:30,470
is sort of a tweeny and way of saying

00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:32,720
context matters not all don't apply the

00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,160
rule universally don't be combative you

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,900
have to balance things out you have to

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,480
balance concise us with descriptiveness

00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:40,550
and I want to make it clear that every

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,930
little bit of advice I give you again

00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:45,080
bell goes off in your head it's not

00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:47,450
universal another bit of advice that we

00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:52,190
definitely have to take context with us

00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:54,800
is do not omit necessary details this

00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:57,440
comes up I'll kind of give the silly

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,840
example when you use really vague words

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,860
because you're maybe you're not sure at

00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,510
the time what the method is actually

00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,040
what the arguments are actually gonna be

00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:06,830
so you just use vowel and you forget it

00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,390
I mean most of us know not to use

00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,350
something like this but maybe there's a

00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:13,910
method like this that you've written

00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:15,230
before and in this case you know maybe

00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,870
there's one line after this where you

00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:19,940
returned the response of a request so

00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,440
why bother why bother calling it trying

00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,200
to figure out what D actually is because

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,290
I mean kind of weird its parts of URL

00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,790
URL prams there's no kind of like nice

00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:31,760
concrete word so why bother I'll just

00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:33,290
call it D and that's that's fine until

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,960
you notice that maybe this method needs

00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:38,360
to get worked on by someone else and in

00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,940
that case D is only the second worst

00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,160
variable name that will be contained in

00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:45,140
this function because the worst variable

00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,480
name is d2

00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:50,640
and you can see how this just starts to

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,460
compound and this I can almost guarantee

00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,110
every one of us has done this maybe not

00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,490
recently but we've done this and it's

00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:58,200
really tempting to do it's really

00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:01,110
tempting to do in test code and I'll get

00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,670
to that in a little bit because it's the

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,990
second example of something I don't I

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,310
don't want to think about how it's

00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:11,970
change or how it's different so I'll

00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:13,460
just move on so what doesn't work - in

00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:15,930
heaven for us next

00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:21,420
don't let fluff and flowers and

00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:23,250
verbosity creep in so we know this that

00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:26,010
don't get cute there bill right there

00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:29,730
very little rule same variable all day

00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:33,180
long so it's it can be really tempting

00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:35,880
to make a play on words or a pun or a

00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,650
cultural reference with our variable

00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,870
names this is really common maybe not

00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:42,000
super common but more most common in

00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:43,560
application names right you have your

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,390
project and maybe that's acutely named

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,130
and that's fine you kind of want your

00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:49,500
project name to be marketable to be

00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,970
searchable to be unique says the guy at

00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,180
a conference saying that there are gypsy

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:57,450
guitarists but beyond that keep keep it

00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:59,400
boring don't don't be cute if you need

00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,810
to show your creative energy show it

00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,700
when you name your project think of it

00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:06,420
you have a beautiful baby boy

00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:08,700
and you named him mark and that's it it

00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,500
may be it's a it's a family name but you

00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,110
don't go out of the way to name his hair

00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,670
or his mustache there's just his hair in

00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:20,700
his mustache you don't don't you don't

00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:22,290
need to get cute beyond that so there's

00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,600
one last advice that mark has for us and

00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:26,130
it kind of encompasses everything which

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,710
is using the right word not it's second

00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:30,890
cousin this kind of comes up everything

00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:33,210
use the correct word doesn't like as

00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:35,910
descript as it needs to be as brief as

00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:38,400
it can we use the right word but I think

00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,750
this has another sort of anti pattern

00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,930
that comes into play and that comes up

00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,880
with consistency maybe again you think

00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:47,400
oh I wouldn't do this I have a name for

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,570
URLs and that's the one I use but maybe

00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,490
you're in a project where they were

00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:52,740
using you or I when they really meant

00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,910
URL and you're well you're like I don't

00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,110
want to change the other code it might

00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,210
break things so I'm just gonna start

00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:58,529
using the correct one and then someone

00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:00,149
down the line says well

00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:02,399
now we're using your eyes an URLs so

00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,990
let's just let's stir using address but

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,060
again I'm too lazy I want to fix the old

00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:08,249
code and we'll just keep it going on now

00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,930
now you have code that's harder to parse

00:15:08,249 --> 00:15:11,310
you have code that's harder to refactor

00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:14,129
because you have to search for all three

00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,449
of these and it's just not as pleasant

00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:17,339
as just saying this is what we're using

00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:19,050
when we see what someone else used

00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:24,089
before and that's what I'm gonna keep on

00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:31,379
using somos we've been talking about

00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:40,079
application code in this talk and give

00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:42,920
me that again sorry and it's important

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:45,839
to the test test and documentation are

00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,509
different we should treat them a little

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:51,749
differently and I think for both cases

00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:53,129
verbosity is is less of a sin this is

00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:54,990
actually I think a completely fine test

00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:57,120
name it's super verbose you would never

00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:59,610
have a method in an actual class or a

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,490
view named this but I'm I'm quite

00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:03,629
alright with it as a test name because

00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,129
you're never really invoking this

00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,990
everywhere else or I can't imagine a

00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:08,459
place where you are so the only place

00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:10,319
you're using it it's sort of a chapter

00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:12,089
title when you're reading your test or

00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:13,740
someone else is reading your desk and if

00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:16,350
the test fails it points to you exactly

00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,639
- what's failing now that said because

00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,339
we kind of got to break the rules in our

00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:22,920
test names it's really easy to just use

00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:24,059
R and s and just short short little

00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,309
lines because who's ever gonna read this

00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:27,750
ha ha ha but people will people will

00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:29,009
need to change the test maybe it'll need

00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,839
to introduce another variable that

00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:32,040
starts with an R so just be explicit

00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:36,300
when you can it doesn't take that much

00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:39,410
more time and it's just worth it to not

00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:44,939
use something like foo and bar and Baz

00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:48,360
so about foo and bar and Baz stop using

00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:50,939
it stop it stop it stop it stop it I own

00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,110
fo0 net so I love the sort of lineage

00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:54,809
and the connection that makes new

00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:56,970
programmers but stop using it especially

00:16:54,809 --> 00:17:00,509
especially stuff using in documentation

00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:02,730
there are so many bad examples in

00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:04,649
documentation where it's written by a

00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,149
developer who knows the code so well and

00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:07,490
they know something is frivolous and

00:17:06,149 --> 00:17:09,360
they just want to show some

00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,419
implementation detail and it doesn't

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,449
matter what the context

00:17:10,419 --> 00:17:15,459
and those so class food defined bar and

00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:17,109
if munch is a strain or something stop

00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:18,999
doing it someone will come along who

00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:20,529
does isn't as experienced that's you

00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:22,359
doesn't know why you would want to do

00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:24,879
this and once a really good concrete

00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:27,159
example the Ginga ducts are incredible

00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:28,720
at this they have common motifs the

00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:30,009
track title artist thing

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,450
they're common throughout the

00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:32,859
documentation its concrete it's

00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:38,619
universal it's something that's really

00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:40,149
well-known so the only other things I

00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:41,889
kind of wanted to add is that this has

00:17:40,149 --> 00:17:43,450
been very sort of general advice the

00:17:41,889 --> 00:17:46,480
Mart chain quotes I think are awesome

00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:49,690
they help you categorize a lot of other

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,820
nitty gritty advice on how to write good

00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:54,820
variable names chapter 2 of clean code

00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:57,159
by Uncle Bob Robert Cecil Martin is

00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,929
really really good at this has a laundry

00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:02,409
list of rules that you can follow I

00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:04,269
highly recommend buying the book and

00:18:02,409 --> 00:18:06,369
reading it I'll also be linking to a

00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:09,100
source when I publish this talk on

00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:10,840
github that kind of some maze it

00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,129
summarizes that chapter to kind of get

00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,820
you started but you should you know

00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:19,889
support the man by the book and that's

00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,889
all I have there any questions

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,960
so we have five minutes for questions

00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:36,810
okay so I just one comment and one

00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:39,600
question my comment is in regard to the

00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:42,120
example used of ballot versus vote

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,220
collection and that's simply that I mean

00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,590
I I love words I love what they mean I

00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,330
love the subtleties of them but like in

00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:50,100
common North American parlance when you

00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,330
say ballot what people think of is that

00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,530
and get that piece of cardstock with the

00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:55,160
bubbles you have to fill in with the

00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:57,660
blacking pen with it you know with

00:18:55,160 --> 00:19:00,020
candidate names on it so it's like

00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:03,120
there's an actual I think there's a

00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:05,520
clarity in vote collection that

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:09,840
unfortunately is a lowest common

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,130
denominator type target so I mean I like

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:15,000
what you're saying I completely agree

00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:18,270
with you but and I also understand why

00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,670
that that that final transition doesn't

00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:25,380
occur very often um the other thing I'm

00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:27,000
actual question was there are times you

00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:32,910
like an excision with the with the ORM

00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:35,640
you can change you know method calls to

00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:37,740
the end of the screen and beyond and so

00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,660
oftentimes you know you want to you know

00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,000
break that out and you can do that to a

00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:44,370
certain extent with you know just

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,210
intentions you know nextline intentions

00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:49,700
but sometimes you literally do have a

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:52,320
variable it's just a throwaway variable

00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:56,780
it doesn't mean anything other than

00:19:52,320 --> 00:20:01,050
einem what to assign this blob of stuff

00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:05,970
someplace such that I can then do

00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:08,220
additional work on it and add clarity in

00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,960
the separation of what's being done but

00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,940
it's not necessarily carried over in the

00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,740
variable names I mean so I'd like to

00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,890
give you back on that sure on the

00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,510
comment first I would defend even though

00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:20,700
about it may not be representing an

00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:24,540
actual physical ballot and maybe there's

00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:26,610
another word for it but as long as that

00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:28,410
is you our models tend to be are sort of

00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:31,620
our starting blocks for nouns thereafter

00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:34,740
views and managers are named after the

00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:36,720
model I think it's okay I don't sit

00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,740
again don't get cute but it's okay to

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,220
enter be

00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,929
a little metaphorical when it comes to

00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:45,240
naming those things because if you're

00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:46,620
gonna be using ballot everywhere you can

00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,380
kind of introduce this is what a ballot

00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:51,000
is for us it is a collection of votes

00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,500
and you can kind of set that stone and

00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:04,770
hopefully your documentation and say

00:20:52,500 --> 00:21:06,179
that's what a ballot is sure and just to

00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:08,100
get it on the microphone for the video

00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:10,200
he was saying that there is such a thing

00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:13,020
as a ballot is a physical thing and it

00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,059
means something I would say depends

00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,920
again it depends it's contextual if

00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:18,120
you're if you're you don't ever care

00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,929
about that physical thing you know

00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,900
you're never actually going to be

00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:23,520
talking about how it's it's fine on that

00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,990
on the question itself I would say do

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,580
your best and when you do do those

00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,170
throwaway variables still name them

00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,660
contextually you may end up using that

00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:31,940
variable and it edit later it's also

00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:34,860
really important when you're debugging

00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:36,690
test breaks and you throw in a PDB you

00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,820
know what you're like well what was this

00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:41,280
before I did select related or prefetch

00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,660
related and then you know what you can

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,790
actually help it out

00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:48,300
prepare for edits and prepare for

00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:52,650
debugging later so thanks for a great

00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:55,980
talk like it goes to the sort of ballot

00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:58,170
example as well for like we work in a

00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,900
community with a lot of non-native

00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:04,650
speakers as well what are your thoughts

00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:06,480
around that sort of thing clarity for

00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:10,650
non-native speakers that maybe don't

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:13,920
have that level of vocabulary sure this

00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:15,600
is I'm gonna say a hard problem and it

00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,920
depends entirely on your audience I

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,990
think it open open source it's

00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:21,360
especially hard and I think you do end

00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:23,190
up just cut using those compound names

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,380
that are hopefully avoided but that said

00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,210
you know it also don't think it's

00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,250
necessarily a-- in the world if you if

00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,570
you say you're like we're gonna use

00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:33,210
ballot even though it's not a physical

00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:35,280
ballot we're gonna use ballot and i

00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:36,750
would say if you document it well both

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,460
within the code and within your

00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:40,500
documentation that does this is a

00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,120
metaphorical term we're using so we can

00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,429
keep things concise and concrete and

00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,690
easy to parse a big problem with user

00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:47,309
vote collection is you kind of have to

00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:48,140
read all three words before you know

00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:50,280
what you're talking about

00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:52,000
versus once you see ballot you can kind

00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,230
of contextualize it like that

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,880
billion it's hard sometimes you just

00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:57,760
have to give up the coast and not use a

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,860
word like that I wonder if you might

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:03,850
have words of wisdom on commitment

00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:08,200
messages so this is gonna be completely

00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:10,450
do as I say not as I do I am until I'd

00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:13,450
slit literally two months ago I was

00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:15,100
probably the worst commit writer because

00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:17,260
I largely worked on projects by myself

00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,570
and I was like hahaha who cares so when

00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:21,130
I talk about future me that's that is

00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,780
literally in the back of my mind I'm

00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:25,270
looking through year-old code and it

00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:29,470
says fixing bug fixing bug fixing bug

00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:31,420
fixing bug and I'm like there's a really

00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:34,750
good blog post that came out a month or

00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:36,040
so ago and I really like that keep your

00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,620
subject super short

00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:41,560
I think the get recommendation is 50

00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:44,620
characters I go a little over that and

00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:46,360
then space space and then a huge as huge

00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:48,310
of the body as you need and again it's

00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,650
context dependent if you're just fixing

00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:53,170
a bug maybe the subjects fine but if

00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:55,930
it's a you know emerge a feature branch

00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:57,340
merge right as much as you can like even

00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:59,140
if you're copying pasting Doc's or

00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:02,110
you're caught you copy and paste your

00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:04,120
commit message in the docs it's not more

00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:09,880
information commit messages isn't a bad

00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:12,700
thing I'm sorry I have a comment but

00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:15,010
it's not my comment okay this get

00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:17,080
absolute URL is poorly defined and

00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:21,570
poorly named it is too late to fix it

00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,570
for djenka 1.0 and we should rethink it

00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,910
yeah I'll let the other Jake or the real

00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:33,880
Jacob I guess

00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:35,770
comment on that whenever he wants okay

00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,230
that's all the time we have so stick

00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:40,500
around for the Microsoft winners being

00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,500
