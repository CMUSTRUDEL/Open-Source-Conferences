okay is this anyone's first time in

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:27,119
austin all right my first time in austin

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,439
i live in raleigh now i lived here for a

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,949
year last year but my very first time

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,840
here was in nineteen ninety i was going

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,630
to k you in Lawrence Kansas and I took

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,890
spring break down here and it's a few

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,100
months later I dropped out of K you and

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,219
I moved here Hannah and I took some time

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,140
off of school and saw a lot of bands and

00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:49,110
eventually I transferred into back into

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,510
UT and eventually i graduated from UT

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,579
and so it's been really fun for me also

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,960
to be back here and if you have an

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,480
export campus yet i encourage you to

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,359
walk around I have a little hole in the

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,010
wall sign up there in home walls right

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,539
across the street from the University

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,210
and if you haven't been there it's been

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,460
around since the early 70s and had my

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,650
graduation party there and buy a lot of

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,210
bands and got started there so it's a

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,200
cool place to stop by and check out if

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,689
you haven't been there yet it's got a

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,479
lot of austin history and music history

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:20,009
so who's wondering why i would be

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,549
speaking at django con if I'm not

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:25,080
involved with django all right yeah okay

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:26,729
that's a legitimate question but I am

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:35,130
kind of connected to django and it's a

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:37,140
funny story so as Jeff mentioned my

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,090
career started at sysadmin magazine

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,829
after I graduated from UT i moved back

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:45,090
to lawrence kansas and i got a job at a

00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:47,100
publishing company and customer service

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,979
and after a few months I had transferred

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,229
over to my first job in in publishing

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:53,640
and sis ammons not around anymore and

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,229
sadly this is about the only sign of it

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,549
I could find online the magazine it's

00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:58,200
unfortunate because it was an

00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,520
exceptional magazine i'm really proud to

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,590
have gotten my start they are about even

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,159
if it was my accident it's what

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:07,259
introduced me to lenox and it was just a

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,849
journal for unix stuff out man's and

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,759
then once linux started getting big we

00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:13,849
expanded our coverage for linux up

00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:16,040
also and some of the relationships I

00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:18,200
have all these years later date back to

00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,260
the very beginning of my career and so I

00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:24,500
want to talk about doing what you like

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,939
to do for a long time with a diverse

00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,099
group of people that you like working

00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:32,870
with and who like working with you which

00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:36,019
is also an important part of this so

00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,159
Frank Wales is right up here and this is

00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:38,959
an example of somebody i ended up

00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:41,659
working with for a very long time he

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,909
wrote that for as back in 2003 I

00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:45,260
couldn't find our cows from sysadmin but

00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:47,450
I could find a newsletter online which

00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,579
is really weird but so this is a

00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:54,170
newsletter i sent out in 2003 promoting

00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:56,659
an article that Frank wrote for us and

00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:58,670
so I was that sound me for about 10

00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:01,159
years and then I moved over a German

00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:03,889
company was expanding and wanted to open

00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:06,139
an office in Lawrence Kansas and so I

00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:07,909
helped them open that office and I was

00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:10,400
there editor of Linux pro magazine which

00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:12,290
is still around and and they have since

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,389
launched several other magazines good to

00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:16,579
use your magazine and admin magazine a

00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:17,840
lot of the writers from sysadmin you

00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:20,209
know still contribute to our admin

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,349
magazine and so the journal-world wrote

00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:25,160
an article about this what was it 2007

00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:26,599
is anyone familiar with the

00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,730
journal-world heard the world's company

00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:33,199
right see your scene where it's all

00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:34,790
coming together now so as I'm traveling

00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,739
the country and going to conferences

00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,970
talking about linux pro magazine and

00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:39,919
linux new media and how we have an

00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:42,980
office in lawrence now I kept hearing

00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,449
that's where jingos from and agent

00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,919
Engels not even officially released yet

00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:48,079
that's a project right and said this is

00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,060
really weird and that we kept hearing

00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:52,040
this from people you know in San

00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,120
Francisco you know international people

00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,530
who were here at events it was very

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,549
strange to be hearing about this already

00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:01,579
and so when I got at home I was like hey

00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:05,359
Frank can you read an article about this

00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:07,120
Jango that I keep hearing about and so

00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:09,889
he did and he submitted the article and

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,500
he probably submitted about August 2008

00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:14,989
because then publishing you know the in

00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,519
for print and you submit it and then

00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:18,079
several weeks before it goes through

00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,269
printing you know and then it hit

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,769
newsstands in September in

00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:23,180
europe because that we were

00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:26,330
international and they got printed over

00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:28,400
in Europe and see what i called it fret

00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:31,099
free that was my idea for the title so i

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,050
thought was clever so it didn't hit over

00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:36,050
here in the states until october but so

00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:38,270
it's hitting and europe in September

00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:43,210
right as Ginga one gets released so that

00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:46,849
was kind of cool so yay ten years later

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:50,210
Django happy anniversary so here we are

00:04:46,849 --> 00:04:52,550
10 years later and 19 years after i

00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:55,280
graduated from UT and 18 years after i

00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:57,590
started my career in tuk and i'm happy

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,360
to say that Frank has even contributed

00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,460
to the project i'm on now open source

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,860
com and i encourage everyone to do that

00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,560
I like these long-term relationships and

00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,500
hearing about cool new projects so

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,569
anyway back to my talk what inspired

00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:15,289
this talk I wasn't able to attend pi

00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:18,020
calm but I being from warrants I know a

00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:20,300
lot of the people involved in in Pike on

00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,979
projects and Django and so I was

00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,199
watching some of the YouTube videos that

00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:27,319
came out of Pi calm and I saw Jacobs

00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:29,000
keynote and i really i really liked it

00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:31,930
and he I thought it was cool how he was

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,539
able to tie in you know that Rockstar

00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:37,430
developer myth and tell if you haven't

00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:38,960
seen the talk yet I really encourage it

00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,779
he talked about how what we need it's

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,190
more average developers and you know

00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:45,380
that the idea of a rockstar developers

00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,580
very limiting he and he also managed

00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:49,669
Italian trail running which I thought

00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:52,190
was cool because we used to run together

00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:55,069
also bit so anyway that inspired this

00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:57,050
talk and if you're not familiar with the

00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:59,060
whole concept of Rockstar developer and

00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,029
many of you are but I know we also have

00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,319
some newer people here it has been a pet

00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:05,479
peeve of mine for a long time and I've

00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:07,250
given talks about recruiting at other

00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:09,860
conferences and and how we have to get

00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,990
rid of this idea of recruiting for a

00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,580
rockstar developer here's one of the

00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,830
bazillion articles that you'll find

00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:18,490
online which recruiters apparently don't

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,620
read these but this one

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:23,110
this one and was interesting because

00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,819
Scott writes it sets an unreasonable

00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:27,009
expectation for regular folks calling

00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:29,050
out rock stars he motivates the team and

00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:30,610
telling someone that their Rockstar me

00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,410
cause them to actually believe it and

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,849
one of the many reasons i have a problem

00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,650
with this whole idea of a rock star is

00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:37,770
it takes a lot of people behind the

00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,729
scenes you know like as an editor a

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,800
publisher I often got credit for the

00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:42,819
magazine and I was just like yeah I was

00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,199
the one that just kind of plugged in

00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,240
holes there are a whole bunch of people

00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:47,860
you know that actually did the heavy

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,990
lifting like writing articles and

00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,099
editing and doing art and you know

00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,110
getting it to the printer and all of

00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:56,889
that so same thing with this idea of a

00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:58,509
rock star developer and so if you want

00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:01,270
to increase diversity you know as Jacob

00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:02,530
was talking in his keynote and you this

00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,770
is one of the many things that you can

00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:08,470
do is eliminate these limiting terms and

00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:10,120
you know that clearly when I read this I

00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,319
mean people see different things when

00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,210
they see Rockstar developer but I'm

00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:14,949
seeing young young white male you know

00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:17,080
and I think a lot of people probably see

00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:19,139
that I'll sound like a lot of country so

00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:22,060
i might not really to this you know and

00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:23,440
and a lot of people that have no desire

00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,590
to be a rock star you know like when I

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,240
see a recruiter you know that talks

00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,500
about beer in the kitchen I personally

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,180
don't work well after I've had drinks

00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,650
during the day and so that's not a big

00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:37,240
motivating factor for me to apply for a

00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:39,400
company there's a keg in the kitchen so

00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,300
I and so when I was looking a little bit

00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,659
more about what people have said about

00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:45,789
rocks are developers and Nathan hearse

00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:47,440
wrote on higher higher light he read an

00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:50,889
article about what developers think when

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,449
you say rock star and he also he posted

00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:54,099
a question on hacker news and asked

00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:56,800
developers what do you think when you

00:07:54,099 --> 00:08:01,560
see rock star and ads and he has some

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:06,729
pretty funny comments like this one I

00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,990
said yeah I like that one if by Rockstar

00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:09,490
you mean someone that her diesel night

00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,469
comes in late and hungover has weird

00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,719
contractual demands and trashes hotel

00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:17,860
rooms on business trips then yes I guess

00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:19,330
I'm a rock star when do I start don't

00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,520
forget to bite the head off the bat and

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,780
trash the place on your way out and one

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,430
of the comments that was kind of funny

00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,690
somebody actually wrote to the recruiter

00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:29,669
and said what do you mean by Rockstar

00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,669
and she wrote back on sorry I'm at ninja

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,970
so uh this is M from the from the

00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:39,349
article you know he said and next time

00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,150
you're thinking about saying rock star

00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:42,890
ninja guru etc and your job post

00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,330
consider it a sign that you have more

00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:47,330
thinking to do about your hiring

00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,980
requirements and I mean it's lazy to say

00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:50,810
rock star ninja or whatever it is lazy

00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,490
it doesn't say anything to me when I I

00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,370
see that I'm thinking this must be an

00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,570
intern who wrote this or somebody who

00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,530
has no idea what they're recruiting for

00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,870
doesn't understand the technology

00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:01,580
perhaps or you know the business if this

00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,960
is what they're doing so obviously it

00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,120
would make more sense to say what do you

00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,620
want me to be able to do what level of

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,450
experience are you hunting for what am I

00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,970
supposed to know what you know what do I

00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,380
need to be really an expert in and

00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,720
somewhat competent in what can I just

00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,490
pick up really fast on the job and but

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,990
more importantly I'm at the position in

00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,820
my career where I want to know what you

00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,110
have to offer me you know and what's

00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,180
your company like what's your culture

00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,210
like you know what am I going to like

00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,950
about the project so that's going to

00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:30,890
make more sense when you're recruiting

00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:34,130
and you want diversity so back to Jacobs

00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:35,300
talk um I I have a DD and people have a

00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:38,330
DD it's not that they're not listening

00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,950
to you as I'm watching his PyCon talk

00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,150
I'm five steps ahead because he's not

00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,160
talking fast enough as far as I'm

00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:45,980
concerned he now and and so I'm thinking

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,390
steps ahead and I'm thinking I've left

00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,460
past his talk and I'm thinking about

00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:51,560
django reinhardt which you know was

00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,880
where django gets his name and i like

00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,620
django reinhardt if you haven't listened

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,260
to him I encourage you to it's wonderful

00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,810
gypsy jazz music it never goes out of

00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,700
style but here's where Willie Nelson

00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,940
comes in django reinhardt is one of his

00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,680
biggest musical influences so i go from

00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:09,020
Jacobs talk at PyCon right into Willie

00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:12,890
Nelson moment and it all happened really

00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:14,000
fast and so I went home and like you do

00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,320
I pulled out all my records and I

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,410
started playing Willie Nelson records

00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:21,050
after work and if you're not familiar

00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,170
the flat ones or albums LPS and the

00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:24,580
little one

00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,590
the cassette they play on much bigger

00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,150
devices in your used to nail the cat was

00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,560
I did not place her if anyone's got a

00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,580
cat they place themselves all in your

00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,480
business and that's what happened there

00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:36,190
but that's Buffy so um that's what I was

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,550
doing when I got home and I started

00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:44,470
listening to records and watching

00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:46,690
YouTube videos and thinking about Willie

00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:49,630
Nelson developers as opposed to rock

00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:51,610
star developer and so I wrote that

00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,260
article and eight ways really am

00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,760
developers to be more like Willie Nelson

00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,520
and I thought about lessons at Willie

00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,510
Nelson has four developers and I'm not

00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,430
going to go through all eight here but i

00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:02,410
have a few and one of them is that he

00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,520
helps others succeed has he actually

00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,980
wrote his first song when he was about

00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,990
seven and you know he didn't make it big

00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,340
until the 60s or 70s so if you've been

00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,410
doing this for a few decades don't worry

00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:13,540
you still could get really big and get a

00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:15,250
good paint job at some point and they

00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,650
said he and he worked behind the scenes

00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:20,740
quite a bit at first and he was a disc

00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:22,600
jockey he played bass in a rape crisis

00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,690
band who I saw in Austin and college he

00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,220
was excellent rest in peace and he he's

00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:29,680
written a lot of songs that other people

00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,810
made famous and he wrote crazy which is

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,320
you know Patsy Cline's probably biggest

00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:36,640
hit right and he wrote songs that Roy

00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:42,550
Orbison and fifty billion together

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:45,730
people have recorded and then I think

00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:47,170
that all of us and not just developers

00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,840
should constantly be learning new skills

00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:53,920
and Willie Nelson I think he's 81 now

00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:55,600
and 81 or 82 by things 81 and he got his

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,430
fifth degree black belt to celebrate his

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,130
80th birthday so this is pretty recent

00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:02,590
oh he's as awesome he's constantly

00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:05,200
learning new skills he's a in addition

00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:07,480
to you know recording and writing music

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,250
he has dabbled on TV I believe he was on

00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,730
episode of Dukes of Hazzard and he's

00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:15,760
been on and the colbert Christmas or

00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:18,880
Hanukkah special whatever it was and he

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,470
he you can look on youtube and there's a

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,740
video of him doing a magic trick in his

00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:26,280
tour bus that's pretty funny and you

00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:30,490
know just a bunch of different skills

00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:32,980
and then I also think that regardless of

00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,279
how far you are in your career and you

00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:38,180
should be accessible to

00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:42,069
wide range of people and so as you know

00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:44,749
Willie records with a range of people

00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:46,639
relatively new in the field and then he

00:12:44,749 --> 00:12:49,040
just released an album recently i think

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,100
is with Merle Haggard and where they do

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,529
i'm django reinhardt songs and jimmie

00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:58,819
rodgers songs and then I've seen him

00:12:54,529 --> 00:13:00,290
play in a rodeo type situation a County

00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:02,329
Fair and I've seen him playing a really

00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:04,279
fancy very expensive theater I got free

00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:06,680
tickets or I would've been there and I

00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:08,720
saw him play and I'm Liberty Hall which

00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,519
is a cool historic theater in Lawrence

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,959
Kansas and it's only time I've ever

00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:13,730
stood in line for tickets but they were

00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:16,370
only about 30 books so it was affordable

00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:18,559
and so I think that's a big lesson for

00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,149
you know anybody who's working an open

00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,279
source that that's very important to be

00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:23,809
thinking about helping new people in

00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,889
addition to working with you know people

00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:26,749
that you know and like it worked with

00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:32,509
for a long time and that helps keep it

00:13:26,749 --> 00:13:34,550
all fresh also and so he also uses the

00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:37,040
best tool for the job and the guitar he

00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:41,569
plays and he's had since nineteen

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:43,399
fifty-nine i believe and 15 or 16 anyway

00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:46,550
he paid 50 bucks for it and it's a

00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:47,660
classical guitar and it's not meant to

00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,399
be played with a pic and that's why I

00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,379
has a giant hole in it and if you've

00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:52,910
ever seen him play i cropped out there i

00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:55,759
guess but and he's had it patch

00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:57,470
repeatedly and he was inspired to do

00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,540
this from Django Reinhardt see how I'm

00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,889
tying them all together because that's

00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,149
what right her place and said

00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:03,589
that's not normally what you hear in

00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:05,089
country music but he gets this unique

00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:08,629
sound out of it that he really likes and

00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:11,930
so he has stuck with it and used it in

00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:13,579
an innovative way so think about that

00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:15,790
the next time you're at an open source

00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:18,649
or Linux event you see people with macs

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:20,120
because I used to bring a Mac to events

00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,939
and i would get grief once in a while

00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,439
and I was like you know get off my Astor

00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:27,470
allowed to use multiple operating

00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:29,059
systems you know and you don't you don't

00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:31,040
have to just print you know pick print

00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:33,110
or online as your favorite you can

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,970
subscribe to a magazine and read you

00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:41,449
know online publications you're allowed

00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:45,230
to do this right thank you and I also

00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:46,460
think it's important to lead and and

00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,110
like I said he's perfectly comfortable

00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,940
working in background roles he still

00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:52,820
records you know on other people's

00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:55,550
albums and that he's also a leader and

00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,260
he really sets a tone for his band I

00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,580
know somebody who worked with him who

00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:01,220
calls him st. really because he's so

00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:03,410
delightful to work with and that leaders

00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,790
I know some people in our field are

00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:06,860
really uncomfortable being in front of

00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,560
people you know or maybe talking on

00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:11,150
stage or they don't want to lead them a

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,280
team but you can lead by answering

00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:16,610
questions in IRC you know you can lead

00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:18,760
by welcoming newcomers to your event you

00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:21,260
can lead by helping organize events or

00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,760
attending a meetup and participating so

00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,190
there many ways you can be a leader in

00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:30,170
open source you don't have to be in

00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:32,500
front on guitar this is not a picture

00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:34,490
Willie Nelson but I like the picture and

00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,900
collaborate with the diverse mix of

00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,610
people and I think this is really

00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,920
important I've this has helped me so

00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:43,640
much in my career um you know anytime

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,080
I'm feeling a little bit stagnant you

00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,310
know it's very important for me to reach

00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,080
out and think of you know what where how

00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,460
haven't I worked yet what haven't I

00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,710
learned and who haven't I worked with

00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,090
yet and what events haven't I've been to

00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:54,380
I haven't been to django con yet I've

00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,730
been wanting to come for a long time so

00:15:54,380 --> 00:16:00,730
I was happy to get invited to this event

00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:02,690
so he Willie Nelson records with

00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:05,540
everybody I mean he would he'd the

00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,950
outlaw music scene that he got into when

00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:10,100
he moved back to austin he kind of

00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:13,040
retired and quit in the late 60s early

00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:15,710
70s because he wasn't getting the fame

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,240
you know that and record sales or

00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:19,250
whatever that he had expected but when

00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,630
he got here you know he started hanging

00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,600
out with these different people the

00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:26,390
Austin people and it helped him come up

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,100
with this new sound to outlaw music you

00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:32,090
know sound and it completely changed the

00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:35,360
direction of his career and and and he

00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:37,250
got some commercial success finally so

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,740
in he's recorded with you know jazz

00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:42,620
artists you know country rock artists

00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:44,600
he's covered at rock songs and he's

00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,520
recorded with Snoop Dogg which I think

00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,480
it's kind of cool and apparently they're

00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:52,640
kind of good buddies and hang out so and

00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,750
that's some good advice from Willie

00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:58,710
Nelson

00:16:54,750 --> 00:17:00,540
so if you are not a rock star developer

00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,800
and that you know you're never feeling

00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,470
like you're going to want to be a rock

00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,750
star developer that's great like Jacob

00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:09,150
says watch the video and it's perfectly

00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,470
awesome to be an average developer we

00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:14,040
need a lot of Jessica dependable

00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:17,579
developers and willing else and one of

00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:19,380
the my favorite quotes from him you know

00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,939
he's been around for decades now and he

00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,410
said I never gave up on country music

00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:25,589
because I knew what I was doing was not

00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:27,089
that bad and so you know he's had some

00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:28,530
not great songs and you're not the best

00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:30,690
selling album see now I mean he's had a

00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:32,160
whole range and and he I think he even

00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,630
recorded a reggae album which I've never

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,020
heard of so apparently it wasn't a huge

00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:38,280
hit right so but I think it's okay to

00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,660
get out there and try new things and

00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,680
you're going to fail at some of them you

00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,730
know and then you can keep doing the

00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:45,450
stuff that you're real comfortable with

00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:50,340
also and and that you're that pays the

00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:52,470
bills I guess so here are the few of the

00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,880
highlights from but I think we can learn

00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,500
from willing else and there many more

00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,730
but I know this isn't a whole week about

00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,100
what I think you can learn from Willie

00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,990
Nelson so I try to condense it but help

00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:05,040
others succeed that learn new skills and

00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:06,750
be accessible to a range of the people

00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,950
in your community and experts and

00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,600
novices also I think it's always

00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,950
important that we can consider it for

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,020
people who don't have the funds to

00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,280
attend events because I certainly have

00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,810
been in that position and I know a lot

00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,780
of people who are and so make sure

00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:20,790
you're able to you know be accessible

00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,070
online in IRC or a community advanced

00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:25,020
low-cost events use the best tool for

00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:27,600
the job or innovate on an existing tool

00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:29,220
or create a better tool or you know

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,330
document the tool because you think it's

00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,890
crappy and realize it's just at the

00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:35,460
documentation scrappy you can help that

00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:37,500
way to play supporting and leading roles

00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,880
and collaborate with the diverse mix of

00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,110
people which I know here you all are

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:45,810
really good about doing that but we can

00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:47,280
always improve in this area and so if

00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:50,000
you all have not seen the willingness

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:55,190
and statue that was developed it was a

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,190
dedicated a few years ago on 420 huh and

00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:00,990
it's over am on 301 Nelson Willie Nelson

00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:02,280
Boulevard it's only about when I have

00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,660
miles from here which i would say walk

00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,460
except it's supposed to be about 100

00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,480
degrees out and but I think would be fun

00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,850
if you do go over to make that

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,860
pilgrimage post a picture on Twitter or

00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,540
Instagram or wherever and tagged jinguk

00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:16,010
on because I would love to see if anyone

00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:18,630
makes it over there it's a cool statue

00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:20,130
