	How to Practice Inclusion and Benefit Django by Kojo Idrissa

WHAT: Inclusion Defined

Not about morality
Inclusion vs. Diversity vs. Political Correctness
WHY: Why does this matter?

Inherent limits on community membership: not ALL 7 billion humans will join AND contribute
Inclusion lets you maximize the number of contributors
HOW: How do I DO this better?

Check your assumptions
Zen of Python on Inclusiveness
Errors should never pass silently
Check for exceptions
Discuss errors when they occur
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess: how much does the ambiguity matter?
Get out of your bubble
Flip the Demographics
Understanding The Power of Privilege
Your Personal Privilege Matrix
Privilege Arbitrage
"Turn Your Sadness Into Kindness"
Closing

What if you feel you can't?

If your heart's not really into it or you feel it's "too hard", be honest with yourself and just hang around others like you. An insincere effort often does more harm than good.

Recognize that this behavior may leave you isolated from a large (and growing) portion of the community.

It's up to all of us

Just as systems tend towards entropy, if you leave a community alone it tends towards toxicity. Good communities require continual effort. - Jacob Kaplan-Moss
