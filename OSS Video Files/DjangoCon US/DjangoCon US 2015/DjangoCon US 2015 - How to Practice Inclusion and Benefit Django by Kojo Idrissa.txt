	How to Practice Inclusion and Benefit Django by Kojo Idrissa

WHAT: Inclusion Defined

Not about morality
Inclusion vs. Diversity vs. Political Correctness
WHY: Why does this matter?

Inherent limits on community membership: not ALL 7 billion humans will join AND contribute
Inclusion lets you maximize the number of contributors
HOW: How do I DO this better?

Check your assumptions
Zen of Python on Inclusiveness
Errors should never pass silently
Check for exceptions
Discuss errors when they occur
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess: how much does the ambiguity matter?
Get out of your bubble
Flip the Demographics
Understanding The Power of Privilege
Your Personal Privilege Matrix
Privilege Arbitrage
"Turn Your Sadness Into Kindness"
Closing

What if you feel you can't?

If your heart's not really into it or you feel it's "too hard", be honest with yourself and just hang around others like you. An insincere effort often does more harm than good.

Recognize that this behavior may leave you isolated from a large (and growing) portion of the community.

It's up to all of us

Just as systems tend towards entropy, if you leave a community alone it tends towards toxicity. Good communities require continual effort. - Jacob Kaplan-Moss

	00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:22,140
thank you everyone and good morning

00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:23,220
again this is me lots of there's a as I

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,199
look at the slide now's like there's a

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,420
lot more information that's a busy slide

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,410
with all this stuff on me said I need to

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,179
make that better for the next time I

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,740
present something but I do talk about

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:33,510
I've given to us on a number of

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,129
different topics but today we're going

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:40,050
to focus on practicing inclusion and so

00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:42,780
if you go back here look at the top

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,340
bullet point here I'm changing careers

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,140
from accounting and finance and moving

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,270
into software development so if you

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,370
wanna hire me you can hire me so why do

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,870
I focus on that bullet point not so much

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,820
for the self-serving plug but more for

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,190
the motivation of the talk so I am

00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:00,449
relatively new to software development

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,620
and when I sort of became active with a

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:03,359
both the Python of the Django

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,320
communities one of my early thoughts was

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,890
how can I make some sort of a

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,210
contribution to the community and as

00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,430
someone who doesn't have a CS background

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,170
I knew that my primary mode of

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,880
contribution wasn't going to be writing

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,890
the wicked codes and that sort of thing

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,369
so I thought well what can I do I can

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,930
try to help grow the community and I

00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:23,340
wanted to focus not just on getting more

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,460
bodies in but actually trying to make

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,259
the most useful growth possible as far

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,369
as bringing in people who would be new

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,530
contributors who would actually be able

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,150
to benefit the community so what are

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,420
some of the challenges that run into

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,340
that one of the issues is that currently

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,829
the community sort of pulling from a

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,759
small pond check communities in general

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:46,320
as many of you know are predominantly

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:50,670
SAS gender the heterosexual white men

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:54,390
and a community in general any community

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,460
tends to optimize its culture to the

00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,549
benefit of the people who make up the

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,619
largest percentage of that community and

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,490
the issue with that is a culture that

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,810
optimizes itself in that way can be

00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:08,700
alienating to people who aren't from

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,410
that specific demographic so that's this

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:14,020
isn't to say that there's a problem with

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:16,330
heterosexual cisgender Dwight men but

00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,070
having a culture that tends to optimize

00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:21,490
itself for that one particular group

00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:22,840
tends to alienate other groups and so

00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:25,120
what does that look like if we take a

00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,920
look at the u.s. population the big

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,260
green chunk and this is the u.s.

00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,580
population broken up by ethnicity as

00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,500
defined by the Census Bureau that's what

00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,260
the data come from the big green chunk

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:38,260
is people who are identified as white

00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:40,480
the light blue is hispanics or latinos

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,910
the dark blue is african-americans and

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,160
so you've got a big chunk there the

00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:48,130
falls into that category but then if we

00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:51,100
separate this the white group by race

00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:52,690
I'm sorry by gender you notice that the

00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,450
big green the dark green shot gets a lot

00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:58,660
smaller so if we have a community whose

00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:01,540
culture is being optimized for primarily

00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,190
heterosexual white men what we're doing

00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,860
is we've got a culture that's optimized

00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,790
to pull from 31 about 30 or so thirty

00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,880
thirty-one percent of the population

00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:12,520
which is a small pool and so what that

00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,740
also means that we are sort of ignoring

00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,750
or overlooking two-thirds of the

00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:19,630
population this is jess us data I know

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,040
Django is a global project but there's

00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,560
only so much data i can get from around

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,510
the world and definitions of what is

00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,370
ethnic vary from country to country that

00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,510
sort of thing but the idea here being

00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,640
that we're pulling from a relatively

00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:33,640
small pool to begin with or that the

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,350
culture is optimized to benefit a small

00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,120
pool and that's a problem as far as

00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:40,000
finding the largest number of

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,920
high-quality contributors but it

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,040
actually gets worse so we take this

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,040
small one third slice and then it gets

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,900
smaller so all of that small slice that

00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,520
the culture is optimized for there is a

00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,650
certain percentage of people who aren't

00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,910
going to join a technical project like

00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,610
this because it's too hard or they think

00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:00,040
is too difficult and so what was the

00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,360
small slice gets smaller and then you

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,350
look at people who might have joined it

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,610
but you know they're not going to do

00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,170
Django we're going to do rails or

00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,250
they're going to do PHP or something

00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,070
else so that's the lies to get smaller

00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:11,980
again and so now you have an even

00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:13,239
smaller pool of potential contributors

00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,070
to draw from because the people who are

00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:16,870
going to contribute to django or to the

00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,820
Python community or to whatever your

00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,049
technical community might be are going

00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,720
to need to be members of that community

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:26,860
so how do we take that shrinking slice

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,660
and make it bigger the focus here is on

00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,310
inclusion

00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,280
and you might have heard the term

00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:34,470
inclusion used sometimes to be

00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,620
synonymous with the diversity I make a

00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:39,450
distinction here in this way a diversity

00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,010
in and of itself it just means having

00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,590
lots of different types of people and

00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:46,140
that's not really difficult to do if you

00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:49,740
want more women or more people of color

00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,780
or more LGBTQ people to show up at your

00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,060
event or function there are different

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,910
groups that focus on those demographics

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,800
you can go find women you can go find

00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,410
LGBTQ people you can go five people of

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,920
color and hey come to our jangle thing

00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:05,760
but are they going to want to stay is

00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,080
when they come and they interact with

00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,910
your community is the culture of your

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,860
community such that they're going to be

00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,850
comfortable when they arrive and they're

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,380
going to want to stay and they're going

00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:15,240
to come back again and again and

00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,830
continue to make contributions so that's

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,500
the distinction between inclusion versus

00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,640
diversity diversity easy to do but hard

00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,680
to maintain inclusion more like

00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,830
sustainable diversity self-sustaining

00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,390
diversity really so now that we've

00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,460
talked about this the focus of the talk

00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,810
is well how how do you do this because

00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,370
yeah I told you what conclusions good

00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,980
you need to have it a little and hence

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,630
your community the focus is on how so

00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,300
I've got some different steps here and

00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:41,490
this is by no means an exhaustive list

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,550
or all the options but these are just

00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:46,290
some basic thoughts I had on the topic

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:49,080
as far as how can you actually try to

00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:51,630
make your individual local communities

00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,940
and the cultures there in a little more

00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:56,730
inclusive the idea being that while

00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:59,720
Django and Python our global projects

00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:03,300
the community actually happens in your

00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,680
individual groups so your looks like

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,690
i'll see some people here in the room i

00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,300
live in houston i'm part of the python

00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:11,040
houston meetup python web meet up some

00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,020
people here from austin the actual

00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,140
community happens in those local meetups

00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,130
or in those local user groups so how can

00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,830
you go about trying to make your

00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,810
individual community culture a little

00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,030
more inclusive step one is to be aware

00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:27,210
of your group culture so step one is

00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:28,680
building awareness clearly the design of

00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,060
Python if you're familiar with Python

00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,940
hopefully you are because you're at a

00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,230
django conference one of the things in

00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,630
the zener python is that error should

00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:39,360
never pass silently and that's one of

00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,460
the things that actually happens if you

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,100
don't have an inclusive

00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:45,020
culture if someone comes to your event

00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,120
to your meetup or your your Co challenge

00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:50,000
or what have you they arrived and

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,310
they're like I don't I'm not comfortable

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,470
here they're not going to file a bug

00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,960
report they're not going to you know

00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:59,180
write you a nice letter you know they're

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,509
not going to you they'll just go away

00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:04,160
and you'll never see them again and then

00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:05,479
you'll wonder well gee you know there

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,590
aren't a lot of there aren't a lot of

00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:07,729
women to come to our events where there

00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:10,520
aren't a lot of people of color become

00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:12,830
bro events I don't know why well again

00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,419
the error will pass silently and so to

00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,370
keep that from happening just like with

00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:20,389
writing code you try to you know check

00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:21,830
for exceptions so as a member of your

00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:23,210
community you try to be a little more

00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,620
active as far as looking around for

00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,810
issues that are happening it's running

00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:29,630
with one who seems to be left out or

00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:31,940
excluded just in general there's anyone

00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:33,500
who seems uncomfortable by certain

00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,870
conversations or comments that are going

00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:39,229
on or are people making jokes that might

00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:41,210
seem fine and dandy but you know just

00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:44,449
some people but might be exclusive or

00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:47,479
offensive to other people other people

00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:49,520
who are being sort of boxed and I've

00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:52,039
seen at a number of different technical

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,380
events so in addition to the Python and

00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:55,849
program meetups I'm also a member of TX

00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,099
Rx labs which is a hacker space in

00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:58,909
Houston so I'm by participating in

00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:00,919
number of different technical

00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:04,669
communities and you know you see a

00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:07,039
phenomenon of oh a woman shows up and

00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:08,690
then all the men just sort of gather

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,880
around the woman is if it's like they've

00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:13,669
never seen one before it's like Oh a

00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:17,449
woman let's look at the woman you know

00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:20,000
and so trying to be aware of those sorts

00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:21,020
of things in your community as opposed

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,210
to just sort of chatting with your

00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:25,849
friends so building awareness of how

00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:27,770
your community culture actually you know

00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:29,930
actually manifests itself is important

00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,250
because you can't try to enhance or

00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,500
improve something if you're not aware of

00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,360
it first I'm not to check your

00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,070
assumptions and Lynn root in our

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,959
excellent talk this morning talked about

00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,599
this a little bit there are certain

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,159
assumptions that get made what

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,899
assumptions are you making in your

00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,820
community and about the people who

00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,350
attended if your groups you know

00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,750
nineteen ninety-five percent a certain

00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,010
way do you just assume oh well it's

00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,779
because these are the people who like

00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,129
programming web development

00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:58,189
people who aren't here are people who

00:08:55,129 --> 00:09:01,399
don't like that is that really the case

00:08:58,189 --> 00:09:03,410
or is that just kind of the convenient

00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:05,149
answer is there any reason that people

00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,980
certain types of people might not want

00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:09,920
to come to your event and if so what can

00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,389
you do about that and this last point

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,189
spend more than 30 seconds on it I mean

00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:14,509
it's a 30-second answer is oh well there

00:09:13,189 --> 00:09:16,220
aren't any women here so women to let

00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:17,449
code well without any people call it

00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:21,050
here so I guess those people don't like

00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:25,059
to write code well that's one potential

00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:27,920
using but maybe not the actual problem

00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:29,180
left is an exercise for the reader is

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,029
this is sort of a homework assignment

00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,620
for you all wherever you are and it's

00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,240
sort of work on this over the course of

00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,790
the week here at django con but also

00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,410
when you go home whenever you're in a

00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:42,410
lot of group setting flip the

00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:45,829
demographics for yourself individually

00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:49,879
so if you're in a situation where you're

00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:52,999
a man and a group of mostly other men

00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:55,699
how would you feel if you were the only

00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:58,370
man in a group of mostly women or if you

00:09:55,699 --> 00:09:59,540
were if you're a white person group of

00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,490
full of other white people how would you

00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,660
feel if you were suddenly the only white

00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,069
person or one of the very few white

00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,809
people and a room full of people of

00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:07,459
color and so on and so forth so just

00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:10,910
spin those around in your mind flip

00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:12,410
those different accesses and and kind of

00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,699
try to think about how you would feel to

00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:16,430
help you develop a little empathy for

00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:18,980
people who aren't in your group and then

00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:21,709
start to think about okay well if I were

00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,269
in that situation what sort of culture

00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:24,470
what sort of culture would I feel

00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:26,990
comfortable with how would I want people

00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,579
to interact with me so these are all

00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,790
things to help you build awareness this

00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:35,540
is step one for being more inclusive or

00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:38,629
developing a more inclusive culture 102

00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:40,730
is to then actually take action so here

00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:44,209
processing your log files talked earlier

00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:46,490
about being aware and not letting areas

00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:47,839
pass silently in any sort of software

00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,490
situation you've got errors there's some

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,410
sort of log file that's created you

00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,939
don't just keep track of those areas you

00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,350
don't just write them down you actually

00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:57,980
have to do something about those errors

00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:59,540
so if you become more aware of your

00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,879
groups culture and you start to notice

00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,860
that there are problems or issues be

00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:05,680
prepared to talk to the people who are

00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:09,130
the organizers of your community

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,570
and who are your community leaders to

00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:12,970
bring those issues to their attention

00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:16,390
but also be prepared to help them to

00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:19,089
work on these things so I see one of our

00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:20,710
organ at Paul Bailey's here one of a is

00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:24,310
the organizer for the Python web meet up

00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:26,860
so and also our general Khan shares here

00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:29,200
if you are organizing a group or

00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,220
something along those lines you've

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,570
already got a certain amount of

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,820
responsibility and pressure that you

00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:35,620
have to deal with and so members of the

00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:38,170
community can help you deal with these

00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,370
issues if you become aware of them so

00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,230
don't just leave it to the leadership

00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:43,000
don't say hey leadership I found these

00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:45,459
problems here you go take care of that

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,430
you should be willing to contribute to

00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:51,070
that as well feedback mechanisms are

00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,990
also important so if you're organizing

00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:54,820
community you're living in community do

00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,860
you have some sort of feedback mechanism

00:11:54,820 --> 00:12:01,209
so that if someone runs into a problem

00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:02,500
or an issue of some sort they can let

00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:04,839
you know that they've had this sort of

00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:08,800
problem also if you have a feedback

00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:11,020
mechanism is it clear is it obvious is

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,029
it easy for people to find but also have

00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,279
you made it clear that you actually want

00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:18,550
feedback from people even if it's

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,589
feedback that might not be positive this

00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:21,820
is also an issue you know they can leave

00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:24,540
me a message on meetup or whatever

00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,650
that's not really a proper answer

00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,510
anonymous by default is always a good

00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:30,310
thing because if someone does have a

00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,420
problem that they want to share with you

00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:34,720
have ever experienced some sort of a

00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,770
negative issue they might not feel

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,000
comfortable having their name attached

00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,290
to it because nobody wants to have that

00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,040
tweeted out later all this person

00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:43,120
Canberra are made up and they were

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:46,240
terrible and the reality is that when

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,880
people do make comments or have

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,370
complaints and that sort of thing there

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,870
it is not uncommon for that do that

00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,370
certainly be turned into a weapon

00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:57,730
against them it's not uncommon for them

00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:59,709
to be blamed for having a problem oh you

00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,450
had a bad experience it's your fault why

00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:02,890
are you such a terrible person the only

00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:05,079
people who have terrible experiences are

00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:08,800
terrible people like you terrible person

00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:13,329
so why are you here being terrible so

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:15,310
it's I mean it sounds funny but it's a

00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:19,480
reality for people and for those people

00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:21,100
not so much with the funny so again

00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,339
be prepared for that so this is step two

00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:28,060
you're taking action step 3 and here we

00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:29,170
get into what is one of the more one of

00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,220
the less develop or shins of the talk

00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,990
because this is an idea that's

00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,550
relatively new to me that I'm still

00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,410
working on actually but i thought i'd

00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:38,380
share with you all here this idea of

00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:40,199
understanding privilege and i gave a

00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,399
version of this talk at ultracaan in

00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:44,470
april of this year here in austin and

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,970
one of the speakers just so i read on

00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,889
twitter made this comment about

00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,779
privileged privileged it isn't welfare

00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:51,579
having it easy it's what you don't have

00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:53,440
to deal with and so when we talk about

00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:56,769
privilege a lot of people imagine

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,810
privilege as like you like reclining on

00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:01,120
a sofa being fed grapes while somebody

00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:03,070
fans you you know and or you know or

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,139
someone you know coming to offer you

00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:07,240
your choice of champagnes but you know

00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:10,029
but no that's that's not what privilege

00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,350
is privileged is this wide range of

00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:12,930
things that you can just go through your

00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,730
life without having to worry about

00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:16,990
having less privileged means that you

00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:23,019
have more things you have to worry about

00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:24,579
day-to-day so based on that I've

00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:27,010
developed this idea of privilege

00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:28,810
arbitrage and if you're familiar with

00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:31,360
financial arbitrage or arbitrage in

00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:34,000
general it's a matter of you know buying

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,180
buying a low selling high taking

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,790
advantage of differences for your profit

00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:42,670
here you can use privilege arbitrage

00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:46,569
again it's the term I made up the IA na

00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:48,279
SS I am NOT a social scientist so I'm

00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:50,649
not an actual sociologist I'm sure

00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:52,630
there's perhaps a better academic

00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:54,880
discussion of this but this is just the

00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:57,850
term i'm using the ID here a privilege

00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,069
arbitrage is if you find yourself in a

00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:03,010
position a relatively higher privilege

00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:05,380
then try to use that privilege to be of

00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:07,180
benefit to people who might have a lower

00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,410
privilege than you in that situation and

00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,790
again when we talk about these

00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,079
differences in privilege as far as

00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:15,010
things that you do and don't have to

00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:18,819
worry about well let's see we'll just go

00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:20,440
into the next slide so here i'm sort of

00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:22,720
working on this sort of personal

00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,480
privilege profile and this is so this is

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,750
what i've set up is a my visualization

00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,310
is my personal privilege profile and so

00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:32,360
we've got a few accys can you all read

00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:34,160
the terms

00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,160
some of these different actually so one

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:40,910
being see is gendered it's a ten-point

00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:43,070
scale heterosexuality male being white

00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:45,290
educational background wealth and income

00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:47,269
and so if you see here this is my

00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:50,810
personal privilege full profile is I've

00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:53,209
developed it as the CIS gender person

00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:55,519
I'm it so I am Missy a standard

00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:58,040
heterosexual blackmail as a CI is

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,720
gendered person I'm pretty much maxed

00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,399
out on privilege like I don't have to

00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,050
worry about anything with regard to my

00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:04,640
gender identity there's like there are

00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:07,700
no issues for me I just go through my

00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:11,120
day-to-day life fine as a heterosexual

00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:13,010
male no issues like this there's

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,690
literally nothing I have to deal with I

00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,829
don't have to if I'm dating someone and

00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:19,670
I were just want to walk down the street

00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:22,130
holding that person's hand okay I don't

00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:25,910
think I don't think twice about it but

00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:32,600
if I'm not heterosexual that I do as a

00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:34,220
man I have I I have been very few times

00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,370
where I've had to stop and think about

00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:39,529
my safety anywhere now some of it is

00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:41,589
also because I am 65 and well over 300

00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:45,500
pounds that have martial arts training

00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:47,750
so so that definitely helps but the

00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,430
enhanced melon into my skin sometimes

00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,600
causing me to be concerned about my

00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:52,850
safety because I might be shot in the

00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,760
face because of the enhanced melanin in

00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:58,519
my skin but for the most part there are

00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,230
situations where not only am I entirely

00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:03,260
safe but I don't even think about safety

00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:06,230
concerns because I'm a man and that's

00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:10,209
just how things are unfortunately the

00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:14,750
world that we live in is in many ways

00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:17,240
sexist and heteronormative and as a man

00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:19,610
who is heterosexual that doesn't create

00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,919
any problems for me and so those are

00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:24,500
areas where I have higher privilege and

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,329
I can try to use that privilege to

00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,250
benefit people who don't have as much

00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:29,059
privilege as I do in those areas now

00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,580
there are some of these other areas

00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:34,010
again on white I gave myself a one that

00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,780
supposed to a zero I'm I could be a

00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,910
little darker you know I'm the lightest

00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:40,580
lighter skin side of things as far as

00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:42,350
african-americans go and and that

00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,169
actually matters in some situations

00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:47,919
there are some cases where that is

00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:51,159
fit to me so again this is still a work

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:54,190
in progress but this is something I'm

00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:56,109
doing just try to help develop the idea

00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,820
of thinking about when and where and how

00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:59,499
do you have privilege and how can you

00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:02,409
use that privilege to benefit other

00:17:59,499 --> 00:18:03,999
people and to make your community more

00:18:02,409 --> 00:18:06,669
inclusive to people who might not be as

00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:08,529
privileged as you are on those axes if

00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:12,369
you want to develop your own personal

00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:13,869
privilege profile there isn't there's no

00:18:12,369 --> 00:18:15,639
real scientific instrument so far as I

00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:17,950
know although BuzzFeed the website

00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:19,720
BuzzFeed has a privileged quiz that's

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:22,539
not a bad starting point as far as

00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:25,330
thinking about what areas might you be

00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:27,879
privileged in again I'm not a social

00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:30,129
scientist so final thoughts here one

00:18:27,879 --> 00:18:32,799
from our former benevolent dictator for

00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:34,989
life just jacob kaplan moss just as the

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,730
systems tend towards entropy if you

00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:38,679
leave a community alone it tends towards

00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:40,720
toxicity good communities require

00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:43,960
continual effort so it's something that

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,480
we have to work on continuously my

00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,940
addendum to that is continual effort by

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,549
as many community members as possible so

00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:53,470
we can't just have jacobian being the

00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:55,090
person who's handling it or just the

00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:57,279
chairs of Django comping the people who

00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:59,409
are working on this the more of us that

00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:01,779
are working on enhancing the quality of

00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:07,299
our community culture the easier it is

00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:08,529
for everyone that's all I've got so I am

00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:11,259
if you want to find me later on the

00:19:08,529 --> 00:19:12,429
internets I'm transition on Twitter the

00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:16,330
slides are going to be available here at

00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:18,279
my github my I have a website but it's

00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:19,720
not really functional because I'm not so

00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:22,269
great with Django and I'm ashamed about

00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:25,480
that especially being at django con but

00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:27,070
that's just how that is so we have but a

00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:32,200
few minutes left for questions and if

00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:34,419
anyone has questions if you have

00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,119
questions after this then I am on the

00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:38,289
internet and I'm also tall and my head

00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:41,379
of shiny so I should be easy to find

00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:43,239
while we're here yeah and this is great

00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:45,039
because I didn't know from talking last

00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:47,350
night that you were you involved the

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:52,799
community you are and in to the extent

00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:56,649
but how what what would be your advice

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,610
in a situation because you know I mean I

00:19:56,649 --> 00:20:00,790
can

00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:06,340
I can imagine that my privilege quotient

00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:09,370
is pretty good to graph it out but um it

00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:12,340
in a scenario though where you have I

00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:13,929
mean like you witness that thing or

00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,280
maybe you don't witness that thing but

00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:18,490
then that person that you're talking

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:22,480
about that you would really like to come

00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:24,820
back but then they're just gone and you

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,820
likes you you know that person who is

00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:29,140
performing the toxic behavior and you

00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:31,270
know in some cases I mean as

00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,770
specifically in a linux user group that

00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:36,790
I was involved with briefly back in the

00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:39,130
90s I mean there were I mean there was

00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:41,380
some of the organizers and I mean but

00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:43,110
they were kind of the sacred cow of the

00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,309
organization and I ended up leaving

00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,990
because you know I didn't want any part

00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:48,910
of it but at the same time I didn't

00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:50,860
solve the problem I mean how would how

00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:53,260
would you suggest you know moving

00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:57,340
forward especially in in local groups

00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:58,660
like that because it you know I'm not

00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,980
the most social person I'm not the

00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,750
person who wants to go out and hang out

00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,010
with people all the time anyway but I

00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:08,530
mean I want to be a part of the

00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:11,049
community but yeah and so so so it seems

00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:12,520
like what do you do if the community

00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:13,630
itself is just sort of toxic or the

00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:17,380
people who are leading the community or

00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:18,760
toxic actually at ultracaan something

00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:22,090
like that came up i had a conversation

00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:24,640
with a few people and they were dealing

00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:25,870
with a technical community that seemed

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,580
like it was just going to be inherently

00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:29,470
toxic because that's how the leadership

00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:32,830
was and their response was similar to as

00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:35,650
they left and that might be the thing to

00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:37,750
do one leave toxic environment too

00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:40,210
perhaps you start another community of

00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:44,020
your own with similar interests but with

00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:47,740
a difference on cultural focus so fast

00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:49,690
slides the third group that i'm a proud

00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,190
member of here is girls coding club

00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:54,490
which is the meetup that we have in

00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:56,260
houston and it is designed for women who

00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:58,600
are learning to code well women who are

00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:00,100
kotas so some of a lot of the people who

00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,630
attend our women who are learning to

00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,490
code it's a comfortable environment for

00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,570
them to come in and work on code but

00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,340
then some of them are women who are

00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,660
already professional coders and they do

00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,550
some mentoring and that sort of thing so

00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,110
it is a space that is designed to be

00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:13,870
inclusive and comfortable for women

00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:15,760
we're coding and so something like that

00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,130
might be necessary so if you've got a

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,960
linux group linux user group that is

00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:23,320
toxic then maybe you just start another

00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,000
linux user group that isn't as toxic you

00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,260
know one that has a better culture as

00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:33,010
they say be the change you want to see

00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:34,120
in the world and again if it oh if odd

00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,320
of these things are ideas that I'm

00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,730
working on so if anyone has any other

00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,530
questions or wants to talk to me about

00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:41,520
it you can find me on the internet or

00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,520
