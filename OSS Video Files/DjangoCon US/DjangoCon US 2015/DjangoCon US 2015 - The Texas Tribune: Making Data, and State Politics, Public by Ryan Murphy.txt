Description: 
	The Texas Tribune: Making Data, and State Politics, Public by Ryan Murphy

The goal of everything we do is the same – how can we produce something useful for the citizens of Texas that enable them to be better participants in their state government?

Our News Apps team is responsible for the building and maintaining of editorial-focused data explorers. Django's ease of use has made it possible for us to architect both robust back-end systems for managing the government data sets that power these apps, and to build compelling interfaces to the data for our users to find their own stories.

More details on the three projects we'd discuss:

The Government Salaries Explorer is our most popular explorer. This project manages the payroll data we've collected of more than 300 thousand public employees, providing a peak behind the curtains into how tax dollars are being spent. It required a system that could standardize the many different formats a public agency may release its payroll information to us, but also remain easy to use for all members of the team so updates happen in a timely fashion.

The Texas Legislative Guide was our spin on a legislative bill tracker. Instead of placing all the focus on the bills themselves, we instead created a platform for our reporters to provide context on the many topics and issues that come up during a legislative session. While we still have the capacity for users to search for bills, the site's bigger focus is on the potential changes this session's legislation may have on the state.

And finally, our upcoming revamp of our Public Schools Explorer will be a Django app. This project is currently in it's very early stages, but it's on track to be released by DjangoCon so there will be plenty to show by then! The challenge – how can we take Texas Education Agency data and turn it into something usable for the citizens – and parents – of Texas? We are building an interface that makes it easy to compare and districts and campuses to one another, opening up state data that has always been public but frustratingly trapped within complicated web forms and paper printouts.

While this proposal is more focused on "what we did with Django" vs. "how we did it" – although that will be touched on as well – I believe the work we've produced is a testament to the impact we've been able to have on the state and its citizens thanks to the support of a system that works well for us.

everybody um thank you for coming and

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:25,350
joining us here in Austin today and kind

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,840
of taken to using your labor day for for

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:32,369
hanging out with a bunch of other of

00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:36,000
Django folk so yeah so I work at The

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:39,450
Texas Tribune which is a start bouncing

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,600
my science news outlet here based out of

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:46,920
Austin Texas we cover state-level

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,149
politics and policy so we're really

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,430
interested in anything that's going on

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:54,719
at that big pink building just down the

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:56,969
road we I'll be explaining in just a

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,129
second what what news apps means and

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:01,770
kind of the bigger picture of the Texas

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:05,159
Tribune and how our kind of technology

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,320
groups are organized but just to touch a

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,960
little bit on the Tribune itself we were

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,830
founded in 2009 so still relatively

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,619
young and far as news organizations go

00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:21,420
we launched on election night in

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:24,229
November of 2009 and we were kind of we

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:27,150
were founded as intently as a non-profit

00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:30,810
and that was that you know is funded

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:34,710
through membership so a little bit of

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:39,060
the kind of PBS and NPR model we have

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:41,210
foundation support we have events that

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,189
we host that we charge admissions for

00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:46,070
the Texas Tribune festival for example

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,110
is one that's that's coming up here in

00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:52,229
October you have Tribune people back

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:55,770
there yes October that is actually here

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:57,630
at the UT campus and HTT conference

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:02,700
center so if you're around you should

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:04,860
come check it out we have the largest

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,960
state house news bureau in the United

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,349
States so that means that we have more

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,960
people who are covering state politics

00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:15,460
did any other organization

00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:17,630
in the US which has been was one of our

00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:19,910
initial kind of claims to fame in one of

00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:23,770
our kind of goals when we were founded

00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:26,330
was to fill in the gap that we saw was

00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,460
kind of left open as a lot of the other

00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:30,080
other news bureaus kind of work were you

00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:33,680
know figuring out where everyone was

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,820
going good news is is a lot of these

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,820
these other organizations have

00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:40,450
definitely rebuilt a lot of that team so

00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:45,470
good news for texts and good news for

00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:47,750
state coverage if you if you've never

00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,310
heard of The Texas Tribune are just

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:53,450
maybe you may know a couple of these

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:56,390
things but we've kind of a few different

00:02:53,450 --> 00:03:00,110
projects that we've that that we tend to

00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:03,410
be known for the salaries Explorer which

00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:07,430
is 1 i'll touch on a little bit later is

00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:09,680
our one of our kind of biggest traffic

00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,110
draws and when our biggest actual data

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,480
applications that we have currently has

00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:17,150
more than 350,000 state employees within

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,460
it and for more than 50 different

00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,630
agencies in the state this is something

00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:24,550
that we're constantly updating

00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:28,430
constantly adding new agencies and

00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:30,170
refreshing the data and the kind of goal

00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:33,920
or purpose of this project has always

00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:35,570
been to kind of show the citizens of

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,150
Texas where you know where their tax

00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:41,540
dollars are going you know it's it's

00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:43,000
been it's always been kind of a you know

00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,810
one of our kind of bread and butter

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,280
experiences that we've always had at the

00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:52,130
Tribune just kind of carried it through

00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,360
I think even think it was 2010 x is when

00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:57,680
we when that when the original version

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,300
of this came out I mean this is one of

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,860
our again I'll touching a little bit

00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,390
later but this is actually one of our

00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:05,990
Django apps that I'll be talking about

00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:10,850
in a couple minutes the person errs

00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:13,010
Explorer same kind of idea we have data

00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:15,800
that we collect from the Texas

00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:17,960
Department of Criminal Justice which has

00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,549
danielle has this big database of

00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:22,669
everyone that's in the currently in the

00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:24,770
state prison system and we've taken that

00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:25,320
data we've cleaned it up we presented

00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,360
based on

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,580
on kind of crime breakdown by housing

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,640
you know by the unit that they're

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:36,300
located in this is updated month by

00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:38,760
month so as people leave the system they

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,640
get removed from a rap as well but the

00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,480
kind of goal this was originally to

00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,070
present you know make this something

00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,710
that was a lot more user friendly than

00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:49,470
what the state currently had and still

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:51,930
has its it's very very lucky it's more

00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,310
kind of just a search box and hopefully

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,910
you get lucky finding you know looking

00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:59,250
for someone that you want so this is

00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,500
kind of a negative of a lot of the work

00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:05,130
that we do with the Tribune is taking

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,780
these large datasets these large state

00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:09,060
government produce data sets and turning

00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:12,960
them into things that are more

00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:15,450
consumable and more user-friendly one of

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,020
the tribunes kind of maintenance has

00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:21,180
always been you know and it's kind of a

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,550
you know a basic news journalism tenant

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,770
is just kind of serving as like the

00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:28,290
translators of kind of the walk eNOS and

00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:31,860
turning into something that the people

00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:34,260
of Texas can use and understand and and

00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:38,370
our work with with data is is a big part

00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:39,810
of that our other one of our other this

00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:42,990
is not necessarily a data project but

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:45,980
definitely one of our other kind of

00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:49,080
claims to fame was our coverage of the

00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:52,140
abortion filibuster here in Austin back

00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:55,890
in 2013 this is our last legislative

00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:59,100
session just it was almost by stroke of

00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:02,340
luck that we happen to be that session

00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,560
had got a agreement with the state to

00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:09,570
stream to live stream the House and

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:11,520
Senate chambers and we you know they've

00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:13,530
always had the ability for to do this

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,650
but it was a horrible horrible

00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:19,860
realplayer powered monstrosity back in

00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:23,220
the one of the back rooms of the Capitol

00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,980
and we we got over to kind of organize

00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,080
with them to get it turn into something

00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,850
that could actually be on YouTube and be

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,270
streamed to YouTube which really opened

00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:35,370
up the audience and a bit in just the

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:38,760
ability for people to actually see this

00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:40,290
stream and again just just kind of

00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,440
just so happened to be that that was a

00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:46,590
very good year to to have have that live

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,170
feed and have that live look into what

00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:53,790
was going on in the house and senate

00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:55,380
that was a very very long night but you

00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,300
know we've with this this was kind of

00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,820
our pushed us into doing something very

00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,280
similar this year as well and really

00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:05,250
kind of changed the dynamic there that

00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,510
it sits now really understood and and

00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,980
understood that this is something that

00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:13,020
you know people will be able to watch

00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:14,790
all across the state so so today kind of

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:18,410
what we're when i'm hoping to kind of

00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:22,290
get to kind of tell everyone about is

00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:24,840
like as a news organization and as a

00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:26,850
pretty small one like how do we kind of

00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,350
go into our decision making about when

00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:32,130
and when not to use django for our

00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:34,380
projects and and when we if we do decide

00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:37,500
to use it like what what goes into

00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,940
making those decisions in terms of how

00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,690
we're going to architect it and how

00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:44,910
we're going to choose what components

00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,350
are part of it and approach the

00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:50,580
deadlines and kind of turnaround for

00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:52,650
that how we make that that small team

00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,960
work in this capacity and i'll be kind

00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:57,480
of explaining the dynamic of that team

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,100
here just in a sec and then i'm going to

00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,780
talk about the a couple of these

00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,480
projects the salaries database will be

00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:06,150
one of them that i think are just kind

00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:09,690
of good representations of the processes

00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:11,310
that we we took in how we went from you

00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:14,280
know starting with starting with kind of

00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:16,590
day one branstrom meeting and got to

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,210
final product and of course we'll be

00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:21,570
saving some time for questions at the

00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:24,120
end so and I'll just kind of add this to

00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:26,730
if there's like I as I'll explain in a

00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,050
sec I'm there's a news app steam and

00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,790
there's a platform team so if there's

00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:32,370
very technical questions I may not be

00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:35,400
able to address there are three of them

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,690
right back there so if they so do not

00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,950
feel afraid to ask those questions

00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:43,800
because I'm sure one of us will be able

00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:47,700
to answer so news apps what what what

00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:50,100
does that even mean so it was actually

00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,940
write the end of last session on the

00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,370
2013 session that we

00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,810
decided that kind of the arrangement we

00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,570
had before is that we had a technology

00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:03,860
team that was responsible for a whole

00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:06,709
lot and still are and do a great job but

00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,329
was getting spread very thin by kind of

00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:09,709
the editorial demands but also the

00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:13,399
demands of the business side the

00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:15,500
marketing side membership and kind of

00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,360
looking at how the rest of the industry

00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,190
was going where they were kind of making

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,829
these dedicated teams to producing

00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:24,880
editorial products we knew that this was

00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:27,140
something that we also needed to do so

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,180
becca aaronson who is one of my

00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:32,269
co-workers and one of the co-leads of

00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:35,209
the news apps team I and Travis why

00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:38,120
Scott who is also here it was with us at

00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:39,649
the time we kind of split off and and

00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,380
kind of damned ourselves the news apps

00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:45,110
team and our job was to be kind of

00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:48,800
dedicated to what you know anything that

00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:52,430
editorial needed plus these kind of more

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,470
editorial focused data projects like

00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:58,760
salaries prisons and other ones that

00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:01,279
came up so we do still have our kind of

00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:04,250
tech platform team so there are the gang

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,750
back there they're responsible for

00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,760
building and maintaining our content

00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,170
management system and they're the ones

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,320
that work closely with marketing

00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:13,579
membership and business to kind of get

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,540
their needs done they've been working

00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:23,060
tirelessly on the Tribune festival site

00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:25,010
and and launch and also are responsible

00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,980
we're keeping the ship afloat they're

00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:31,610
they're the ones that keep an eye out on

00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:34,430
deployments what we've and work closely

00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,839
with news apps to kind of if as we as we

00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:38,930
get to deployment phases with our

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:42,230
projects we'd often turn to platform

00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:45,079
often specifically Daniel back there to

00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:46,970
to make those things happen and I

00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:50,180
apologize for what's what's next year I

00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:51,529
just I always love how every conference

00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,910
library talk that talks about docker

00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:54,410
which I'm going to briefly mention it

00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:56,990
has to have it has to have a ship

00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:58,760
container thing so I wanted to continue

00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:01,279
I don't want to break that that thread

00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,360
so there's been a lot of great ship

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,200
container art that's come out of this

00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,360
product

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:10,280
um so news apps so we are actually on

00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,230
the editorial team so we are where are

00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:15,980
technologists that are embedded with the

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:20,210
reporters with the multimedia team with

00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:23,180
the art department to do development

00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:24,650
based around that you know but this is a

00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,030
good point where I kind of stress like

00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,310
we're sitting in the same room as the

00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:30,440
reporters we're all together that's also

00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:32,990
true for the tech team so The Tribune

00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:36,260
we've always tried to really keep those

00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:38,330
walls take those walls down and not let

00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,730
it be very much kind of technologies

00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:42,470
over here and news people are over here

00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:45,110
we're all kind of working toward the

00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:48,560
same goal we're always in conversation

00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:50,840
always talking so but we're the team

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,090
that's that's kind of dedicated to doing

00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,970
the development work for anything that

00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:58,370
comes up for editorial depending on the

00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:00,350
time of year depending on the kind of

00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:03,950
scope of the projects we we kind of

00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:06,710
morph into different kind of kind of

00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:07,940
arrangements we'd also work on graphics

00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:11,030
that you'll see running on our stories

00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:13,810
we build Interactive's we do the data

00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:17,540
explores again like salaries and prisons

00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:21,530
and also work on the kind of the big

00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:24,590
bigger series features that you know a

00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:26,000
more kind of text or multimedia base but

00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:28,940
we're kind of the web development team

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,220
that puts those together and we also

00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:33,890
responsible for working on data

00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:36,830
reporting which is which is a definitely

00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:38,720
kind of Becca and eyes background we we

00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:40,280
kind of came from being more kind of

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,080
data reporters for the newsroom and

00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,480
transitioned into doing more development

00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,250
but we still do that stuff as well so

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,790
this data data sets come in the

00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:51,350
reporters need help with kind of parsing

00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:53,690
through a bigger data set or just making

00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:58,960
sense of it that still kind of falls

00:12:53,690 --> 00:13:00,770
under our tent just to kind of give

00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,720
highlight a couple of them and I'll

00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:04,310
these these links are all be included

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,110
the end just to kind of give a list of

00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:07,940
things to kind of touch through but just

00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:10,750
examples of some of the things that

00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:12,980
we've you know we're kind of we focus on

00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:16,590
faces of death row for example was our

00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:19,120
project that looked at the

00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:20,560
the kind of look did everyone who is

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,640
currently on death row in the state of

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,640
Texas which is is I wish I would have

00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:29,470
looked up to kind of stats on that but

00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,600
at the time this is an alder photo and I

00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,790
kind of course cut off the number but

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,390
more than 200 people are on art on death

00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:40,450
row in Texas and we we went through the

00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:42,420
painstaking process of getting the mug

00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:44,770
shots for for all those individuals

00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:47,860
which was was was something that the

00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:51,370
state agency was not not at first really

00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:55,270
really wanting to release but you know

00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:58,210
we wanted to to present this this large

00:13:55,270 --> 00:14:00,700
group of people that that are just kind

00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:02,700
of been some people more than 40 years

00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:07,630
have been just kind of in this system

00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:10,060
and and you know give kind of resurface

00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:12,370
that conversation kind of more on the

00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,810
interactive side top right hairs are at

00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:17,140
kind of just a snapshot of our

00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:20,010
reservoirs Explorer this is our kind of

00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:23,620
just live tracking of the state of the

00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:26,080
reservoirs in Texas this is something

00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:29,680
that we not Jengo but this is something

00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:34,390
that we've we've had for 34 years now

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:36,880
and we every day get fresh data that's

00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:39,580
that this keeping track of the state of

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,760
every reservoir indexes and this is one

00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:44,740
of our kind of more 1p but popular apps

00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,260
that a lot of kind of our audience is

00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,730
interested in water issues will very

00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,620
very quickly tell me whenever it's out

00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:53,530
of date so we have a small but

00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,820
passionate audience for that and the

00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:56,140
Texas Legislative guide which is at the

00:14:54,820 --> 00:15:00,040
bottom right which I'll touch on again

00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:01,480
in just a little bit was our there are

00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:05,920
big project at the beginning of this

00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:12,010
year to kind of a combination of data

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:13,960
and editorial to to kind of approach the

00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:16,780
coverage of the legislative session a

00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:19,180
little bit differently so one thing I

00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:20,980
wanted to kind of touch on but it's kind

00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:23,110
of leaving the brick break out of the

00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,090
team's part there's another part of the

00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:26,860
reason that we have kind of the explicit

00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:29,560
platform team and news apps team is

00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,910
there's this this formal informal kind

00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,940
of

00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:34,350
in the sand for editorial that way you

00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:38,130
know we intentionally keep it that way

00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:39,750
and well we we all like everyone in the

00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,760
organization and we all get along great

00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:45,870
it's it's definitely kind of meant to be

00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:47,760
a you know a separator you know there's

00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:51,600
a reason why news apps doesn't do

00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:54,180
membership and doesn't do business you

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,030
know it's it's it's it's you know if we

00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:58,590
feel better about knowing that that the

00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:01,470
teams that are dedicated to editorial

00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:03,900
don't touch any of that stuff and that's

00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:06,510
that's been kind of our another big part

00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,250
of breaking out the two teams in two

00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:10,290
separate kind of groups because we

00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,760
wanted to be able to maintain that and

00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,400
of course doesn't mean we don't still

00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,260
you know if technology things come up

00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,660
that you know we want that platform

00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,920
needs help with will help with but we

00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,210
definitely going to try to stay as for

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:26,970
you as much as we can away from the

00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:28,950
content aspect of that so as you know

00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:30,870
being a talk at rio grande it be

00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:35,160
assumption that we're using django all

00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:38,160
the time but but no not actually we're

00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,270
we very much you know if just just

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,370
wouldn't found a bunch of random things

00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:44,940
we actually do use all these the flask

00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:45,630
middleman node you know we always want

00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,110
to make sure that we're approaching

00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:51,480
everything with the right tool it is it

00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:54,180
is if an app can be a SATA cap and has

00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,860
no database has no app server it is a

00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,960
fantastic good day and i will i will

00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:00,720
fight for every every project that can

00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:03,180
be that way because it cuts magnets down

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,690
to practically nothing i'm just hoping

00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:08,760
that s three doesn't go down so because

00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:10,110
the team is so small you know this is

00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,240
this is really important that we don't

00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:15,900
let everything kind of blossom into a

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:18,030
big Django or big just any like

00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,950
database-driven project because there's

00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,930
only so much time that we have and we're

00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:23,910
also kind of on the hook for maintaining

00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:27,060
all of these pre you know the salaries

00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:29,430
prisons all these other apps that don't

00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:32,730
really have end like they will it will

00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:35,670
continue in perpetuating until I guess

00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:38,790
the Tribune is no more which hopefully

00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:40,560
at any time soon and we know we want to

00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:43,320
try to save the bigger tools the heavy

00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:48,120
lifting for the projects that are that

00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:49,590
you know more suited for that so of

00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,240
course it kind of pivots into the

00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:54,649
question of why are we doing Django at

00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:57,179
all I think rails is okay it's fine

00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:58,380
flask is is definitely simple and you

00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,580
know if we need to just kind of have

00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:03,120
something that's sitting in front of a

00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:04,679
end point that's great and static site

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,750
generators have just exploded in the

00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:09,389
past couple years and it's just kind of

00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,769
continuing down that path there are some

00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:12,649
news organizations that will have

00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:15,870
committed to only doing things that way

00:18:12,649 --> 00:18:17,190
and I think that that's that's that can

00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:19,740
be a challenge if you're just really

00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:24,210
refusing to ever touch a server or a

00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:26,340
database but it's certainly possible but

00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:27,990
for us you know it's it's the the

00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,789
batteries that are included that that

00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:33,389
Django just makes it really easy for us

00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:38,250
to to turn projects for a quick or at

00:18:33,389 --> 00:18:39,960
minimum Explorer project very quick you

00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:44,399
know they're very obvious one Django

00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:46,289
admin we do you know I do think that

00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:50,700
we've in some of our situations we've

00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:51,990
we've leaned on the admitted but for

00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,960
internal projects it's been fantastic

00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:58,559
because you get that basic kind of crud

00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,990
set up for free we've been able to to

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,360
kind of do you know spin up a nap really

00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:06,870
quick just for data entry just for

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,980
working with reporters that have you

00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:11,220
know something that we know we can't

00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,360
scrape something that we can't do just

00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,059
kind of process through is like

00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,500
spreadsheet but we want to you know

00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:19,379
ensure that we have kind of the

00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:25,710
validation in place for every step of

00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:27,659
that that process often you know almost

00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,610
it's if there's a very good chance that

00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:31,620
if we ever are touching Jengo we are

00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:35,250
using geo jen go and post us in some

00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:39,179
capacity almost it pretty much anything

00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:42,960
we've we've done has this kind of GIS

00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:44,549
element to it so often we're looking at

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,720
things at the county level with the city

00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:52,320
level at the comparing you know the

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,690
state totals to local totals and you

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,850
know the real power of this combination

00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,240
is that we get to spend a lot less time

00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,130
thing

00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,490
about how to manage that data how to

00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:05,280
turn it to something usable we can just

00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:07,590
load it model out load it and go and

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:11,070
that's that's that's definitely kind of

00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:12,480
a good this cuts out a lot of that that

00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:17,910
very distracting figure out how to

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:19,290
organize things many of our kind of we

00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:21,450
have so we kind of have two different

00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:24,150
kind of kits that we have built out we

00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:26,760
have our jingo powered kind of

00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:29,460
templating that are set up that's meant

00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,080
for you know your more traditional apps

00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,730
where you have the database and you're

00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,220
loading all the data there and then

00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:38,040
generating pages from that but we also

00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:40,490
use kind of our version of our static

00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:43,800
site generator which is written a node

00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:46,500
that uses a templating language called

00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:49,200
nunchucks which is almost identical to

00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:52,230
jinja two it's actually kind of crazy

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,810
how they've that would simulate sit so

00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:56,880
closely but the advantage is that you

00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:58,320
know there between the Django template

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,140
language and jinja to there's not you

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,090
know there are differences but because

00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:05,460
they're similar enough you know we're

00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:07,440
able to get designers and other

00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,970
developers to really kind of when

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,700
they're needing to build pages that the

00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:13,950
mental jump is not very far you know

00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:17,160
we've there's it's they can kind of go

00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:19,680
from working on a static app and looping

00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,360
through data and you know building list

00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:24,510
and then come to a jammer project and do

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:27,390
the very same thing and it's it's not

00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:28,650
not a big like loss of time for them to

00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:32,790
figure out the differences between the

00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:37,130
two certainly comes up but it's great

00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:37,130
for for just having that that breakout

00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:42,020
for me one of the best things is just

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,790
being able to do the data modeling and

00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:46,980
probably my weird favorite part of doing

00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:49,800
anything in Django is building out the

00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:52,620
models because that's i feels like Legos

00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,120
almost to me for some reason but you

00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:56,220
know it's great because we can we can

00:21:54,120 --> 00:22:00,150
use this again it's all those built-ins

00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:03,180
all those kind of affordances that you

00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:04,650
can get from from just you know modeling

00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,720
out what what it is and look like all

00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:10,200
the validators all the forms get come

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,540
along with it and then using those forms

00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,280
and

00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:15,730
alligators for the loading of government

00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:17,470
data so we know we have you know we know

00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:20,110
you know we get we can use the built-in

00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,700
Django kind of logging systems to to

00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:23,500
kind of fill up that flag and say hey

00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,180
there's something funny here this date

00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,190
doesn't have there's only three

00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:30,280
characters in a year you know there's

00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:32,140
examples like that that you know we you

00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,480
know doing a lot of things kind of with

00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,770
Excel sometimes we don't know who would

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,180
know is can just like come across those

00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:39,910
sort of things it was it would very easy

00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:41,560
for it just to kind of kind of pass

00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:44,170
through and not notice that something

00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:47,440
was wrong and because it's so easy to

00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:49,810
spend these up and so easy to kind of

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,000
build out those those kind of structures

00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:53,950
for this this you know we can we can we

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,220
know it's worth that extra kind of like

00:22:53,950 --> 00:23:02,530
our to build out something just so we

00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:06,070
get all the extra editions and of course

00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:09,700
jingo being you know birth out of a you

00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:11,860
know news organization we've you know we

00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,810
have a great community that that we can

00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:17,920
work with and interact with you know if

00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:19,480
there's challenges or if there's you

00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,010
know just just watching whatever else is

00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,190
doing and I put this up here just

00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:26,770
because if anyone knows much about the

00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:29,560
kind of the news lay out our kind of

00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:31,630
landscape in terms of platforms and

00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,160
things that that New York Times has

00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:34,330
always been very traditionally rails

00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,220
they use everything I mean they've

00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:39,190
there's go back there and everything but

00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:42,280
I was just very excited to see that that

00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:49,240
Django is starting to make its way in so

00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:53,590
hats off to you Jeremy Bowers so for how

00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:55,930
we kind of we approach our projects you

00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:58,270
know we know that often that our times

00:23:55,930 --> 00:24:00,670
are going to be very very tight it's

00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:02,560
very rare that there's one exception

00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:04,720
which I'll get to but we there's very

00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:08,320
rare that we have kind of a long like

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,520
your six-month kind of span that we're

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,550
going to get to really work on a project

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,850
take the time tweak it push back for a

00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:17,170
month certainly happens but often you

00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:20,080
know there's all these other kind of

00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:23,140
elements that go into it or it's just

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,320
something that we need out quick if a

00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:28,880
project is going

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:31,130
to not exist forever like one of the you

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,080
know one of the major dead apps they

00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:35,870
must have a sunset plan we have to have

00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:39,320
a process for eventually turning that

00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:40,789
server off because we've is I think

00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,990
we've seen a lot we even we've

00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:43,250
experienced and we've seen in a lot of

00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:45,110
other organs eight news organizations

00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:47,539
that you know the the ease of building

00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:50,240
it is exciting and you get it up and

00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:51,980
it's running and everyone's excited but

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,450
then eventually you know some you know

00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:55,340
if it's not something that's that's top

00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,700
of mine being updated on a regular basis

00:24:55,340 --> 00:25:00,139
someone's going to forget about it and

00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:03,830
you know worst-case scenario it goes

00:25:00,139 --> 00:25:05,840
down other case is it's just bleeding

00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:08,169
money I mean you're not you know no

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,039
one's no one's really noticing that so

00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:14,509
you know we always want to be sure that

00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:15,860
we have a plan for kind of just turning

00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:18,110
off the servers turn off the device and

00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:22,190
letting it continue to exist in just

00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:23,629
kind of a frozen state so the first of

00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,669
the projects I was going to just was

00:25:23,629 --> 00:25:28,879
going to touch on was the disappearing

00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:31,250
Rio Grande so we mean I'll actually Oh

00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:36,649
who because i can't select click on that

00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:39,220
but so this project was one that was

00:25:36,649 --> 00:25:44,929
pitched to us by of freelance reporter

00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:49,009
named colin mcdonald he used to work at

00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:53,860
the san antonio express-news and was was

00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:55,789
had been itching to find some pathway to

00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:58,370
traveling all the way down the Rio

00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:59,690
Grande River and he wanted a place to

00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:02,000
publish this he wanted a place that he

00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:04,940
could kind of maintain kind of a running

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,070
blog of what his experience was he was

00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:10,820
going to have an award-winning

00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:12,500
photographer traveling with him and he

00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,360
would ready had set up a Kickstarter and

00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,190
was was getting that funded and reached

00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:20,210
out to us and said hey do you want to be

00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:23,750
the partner on this and when he was at

00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:27,500
the express-news he actually KY act all

00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:31,759
the way across the Texas coast I went

00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:35,450
from bottom to Louisiana side he hiked

00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:37,010
across big bend in like 12 days so the

00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:40,840
credentials certainly checked out the

00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:43,010
he was very serious about taking

00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,950
starting all the way up in Colorado and

00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:47,960
coming all the way to the Gulf so this

00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:49,550
was a project that kind of you know

00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,760
regrettably kind of snuck up on us

00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:55,880
because we kind of went back and forth

00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,410
about the feasibility of getting it you

00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,840
know being the partner and then how that

00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:02,810
was going to work it's just kind of in

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,310
that weird little void when we were kind

00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:05,750
of the post transitioned and figuring

00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:08,990
out how we were going to kind of on this

00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:10,730
project so but you know we knew that

00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:12,290
this was something that was going to

00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:16,790
rise to the level of being a django

00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:18,260
powered project so for the you know what

00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:21,710
we needed to have is that we needed a

00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:22,880
way to you know was actually very cool

00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,920
was that column was going to do a lot of

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:29,030
data collection as he was traveling down

00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:31,430
the river he was taking water

00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:33,080
measurements every night so every they

00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:34,160
were there camping along the river when

00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,050
they were in places that they were

00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:38,770
allowed to camp on or got permission

00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:41,420
from the private owner property owners

00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:43,070
and at every point he was doing a water

00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:45,740
measurement to kind of test what the

00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:48,200
state of the river was at that time and

00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:49,460
at that location so when we were

00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,010
building this out we had to build

00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:54,830
something that was that supported that

00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:56,960
that was easy for him to to get that

00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:58,820
data into the system and there was an

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,240
extra level of you know he was going to

00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:04,130
be often you know sleeping in a tent and

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,510
was not initially I was gonna have a

00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:08,420
good enough connection to just be

00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:11,090
sitting there you know typing numbers

00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,830
into the Django admin so you know it had

00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:16,700
to be something that he could email off

00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:19,820
and get if someone to kind of help him

00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:24,160
get all that information in what was

00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:26,450
probably to me the coolest part of his

00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,840
kind of trip was that he had this little

00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:32,720
little clicker essentially that was a

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,100
sent out a kind of ping up to a

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,340
satellite that said this is where I'm at

00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:39,710
this is my lat long right now and we

00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:42,050
were we were able to work with the kind

00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:45,440
of craters of that system to get access

00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:47,330
to their API and get that feed so like

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,860
as every time he hit a point we would

00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:50,750
know with and we were checking it

00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,700
probably like every 10

00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:54,230
10 minutes we would know whether than

00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,330
10-15 minutes exactly where he was at

00:28:54,230 --> 00:29:00,020
and we're using that data it's going to

00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:02,060
build out these these kind of bigger

00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:05,300
interactive maps that it showed like

00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:07,190
where he traveled during that day and

00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:10,640
kind of collected into this big like

00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:12,260
bigger map that was looking at what you

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,050
know his whole kind of trajectory as he

00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:16,700
traveled down the river we also had to

00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:18,290
kind of do the media uploads build

00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,200
sortable galleries because again this

00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:21,860
you know didn't want to waste this

00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:25,580
fantastic photographer that was

00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:27,200
traveling with him and probably one of

00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,480
the biggest thing is this this this will

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,450
you know there's I the one kind of

00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:35,870
product or like app suggestion i will

00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:39,200
make and advocate for was white noise

00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:43,670
which has been one of our kind of you

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,260
know great great tool to have for for

00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:48,650
these quicker apps when we don't have to

00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:50,330
worry about you know building out static

00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:52,130
file servers for everything even though

00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:57,560
it is going to list exists for two weeks

00:29:52,130 --> 00:30:03,890
white noise wraps that up into when

00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:05,540
Django's serves so it provides that kind

00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:07,400
of same functionality but its belt

00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:09,770
wrapped in it was originally kind of or

00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,120
not print originally but it's been was

00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:14,660
is it always kind of pitch is a good

00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,830
partner with like Heroku because you get

00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:17,690
that kind you don't have to set up all

00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:20,690
the separate hosting for the static

00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:23,000
files but for our purposes it's been

00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:25,280
great because again it's so simple and

00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,510
straightforward you know especially if

00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,780
an app again it's only going to exist

00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:31,280
for a couple weeks or a month it's not

00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:33,290
ever going to really have the load that

00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:37,160
we know we need to like build out this

00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:39,080
kind of multi redundancies setup so this

00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,840
this is one of the stars of every every

00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:45,200
app these days but when it is kind of

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,430
plug it there real quick the Texas

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,020
Legislative guy which I showed off

00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:50,990
showed just the picture of a little bit

00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:55,010
earlier was again that was our most

00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:58,340
recent kind of bigger Django project and

00:30:55,010 --> 00:31:00,590
in our approach was that we've we've had

00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:02,179
covered a couple sessions and usually we

00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:04,519
know we had our standard stories and

00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:08,209
coverage that was going along with that

00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:09,979
we had built out in the past build

00:31:08,209 --> 00:31:15,049
trackers effectively so using the

00:31:09,979 --> 00:31:18,679
state's data to to to kind of like have

00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:22,429
our own interface on the state's kind of

00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:24,169
the state of the bills in session which

00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:25,729
worked and was good and it was

00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:28,609
definitely a much more enjoyable kind of

00:31:25,729 --> 00:31:29,959
way to interact with that bill data but

00:31:28,609 --> 00:31:32,659
but when we were kind of approaching

00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:34,489
this this this wave of this new session

00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:38,509
we know we wanted to try to figure out a

00:31:34,489 --> 00:31:39,799
way to do that differently because we

00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:40,909
kind of had approached you know we'd

00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:42,139
felt like we had approached a lot of

00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:45,440
those previous sessions like wait bill

00:31:42,139 --> 00:31:46,820
tracker good we're done but but for me

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,320
and this was kind of a personal kind of

00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,820
challenge I had with that was that you

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,190
know we often in stories would talk

00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:54,259
about these bill numbers it would become

00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:56,989
sb20 and then every time a reporter

00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:59,599
wrote about it it would be SP 20 but if

00:31:56,989 --> 00:32:04,009
you came into this the session you know

00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:05,479
a month or two in that bill number means

00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:07,309
nothing to you know there's there's no

00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:09,769
there's there's you know it's it's

00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:11,059
dissing it's it not attached to the

00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:12,829
actual issue well you know for some

00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:14,690
people it you know rises to that level

00:32:12,829 --> 00:32:15,709
that they recognize what that is but if

00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:19,399
you're not someone who's following this

00:32:15,709 --> 00:32:21,469
day to day that that build number you

00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:22,729
know could potentially you know you got

00:32:21,469 --> 00:32:26,359
to go hunt and figure out what that

00:32:22,729 --> 00:32:28,369
actually means and also as we know the

00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:31,339
challenge in Texas is that issues on

00:32:28,369 --> 00:32:32,570
bills just because a bill dies doesn't

00:32:31,339 --> 00:32:34,519
necessarily mean that it's issue went

00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:36,349
away I'm gonna pop back up on an

00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:38,659
amendment that you know they found a

00:32:36,349 --> 00:32:40,159
threat of kind of connection to and in

00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:41,719
the very same language could end up

00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,599
somewhere else but now the build number

00:32:41,719 --> 00:32:46,579
is different so we wanted to approach it

00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:48,019
you know again less less about the build

00:32:46,579 --> 00:32:49,940
number or more about the actual issues

00:32:48,019 --> 00:32:52,519
that we were that that were being

00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:54,950
covered yeah we really wanted to let the

00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:56,899
reporters be content experts that they

00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:59,779
are that that that it you know it was

00:32:56,899 --> 00:33:01,279
less about kind of trying to aggregate

00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:04,159
all this data into one place that

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:05,739
someone can just go look at but giving a

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:09,079
platform to the reporters to actually

00:33:05,739 --> 00:33:10,669
kind of maintain this evergreen look at

00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:14,739
what each one of these issues were you

00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:17,509
know we're going through so so like

00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:18,440
campus carry for example like you know

00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:20,710
we you know we were

00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:23,990
covering that very doesn't you know

00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:25,940
constantly but you know the language and

00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:29,149
the bill that was doing that kept moving

00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:31,309
it kept traveling but you know instead

00:33:29,149 --> 00:33:32,570
of us making about that bill number they

00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:35,629
haven't explained every time that it

00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:37,519
changed you know we instead just let it

00:33:35,629 --> 00:33:40,220
be this kind of block of text that the

00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,809
reporter was curating and build income

00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,279
this list of stories that they had been

00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:46,309
writing about it and let that be what

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:49,340
informs you know what's happening with

00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:50,929
that issue versus just kind of having to

00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:52,129
try to draw all these lines there in

00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:53,840
every single story with like three

00:33:52,129 --> 00:33:56,659
paragraphs at the beginning of like it

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,120
used to be here and now it's here and

00:33:56,659 --> 00:34:02,360
also we really wanted this to be

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:05,830
something that had a designated end you

00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,830
know we wanted this to be something that

00:34:06,009 --> 00:34:12,889
that that that was purposely dedicated

00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:16,609
to being a resource at the end of the

00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:19,550
day so like that so one session ended it

00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:21,740
would be kind of like frozen and and be

00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:23,869
a source that you can go to and see okay

00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:24,980
what happened in this session what what

00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:27,530
happened with this issue that i was

00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:30,319
following rewrote all of the kind of

00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:34,040
summary text to be kind of conclusions

00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:38,359
to to those to those things left let's

00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:39,800
see I've about one minute left so just

00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:43,399
to touch on quick government excels

00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:46,579
Explorer this has been one of the oldest

00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:48,079
apps that we have back to 20 guessing

00:34:46,579 --> 00:34:49,700
2010 actually I've did there's been

00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,200
variations of it that have existed so

00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:53,000
it's it's kind of actually a question

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:57,950
mark when it for when you would consider

00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,839
technically there but this is the are

00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:02,690
one that we are constantly updating and

00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:04,369
maintaining going to give proper

00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:07,339
shout-out to Travis was good and Dan

00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:10,130
hill who who did a bulk of kind of the

00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:15,770
front work on it dan and I were the ones

00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:17,829
who can close it out but a big part of

00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:22,000
what we were kind of going for with this

00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:24,380
is is really wanting to abstract out the

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,700
kind of the data elements of it in the

00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:28,130
presentation elements of it which is

00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:30,829
actually two separate Django apps that

00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:32,120
we built for this purpose and the goal

00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:34,790
there was to

00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:36,530
you know knowingly like pro Qing it as

00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:38,270
you know there's a bear's a front end

00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:41,240
kind of element of it the user facing

00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:43,880
reader facing but also wanting to be

00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:46,780
able to use that data internally and

00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:49,760
have kind of the data app in this case

00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:52,520
that could be repurposed for anything we

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,410
wanted to get into and not necessary

00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:58,700
have it have to travel with the front

00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:59,990
end elements of that I can't get that

00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:03,440
link going but running out of time

00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:04,910
anyway so but again just to just to

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,370
touch on with the self documenting so

00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:08,480
the repo and actually all the reposts

00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:10,760
for all these project I've talked about

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,760
are actually open source soon on on our

00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:16,400
github but you know we wanted to make

00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,140
sure that there's code that's written to

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,230
clean up every single data set that goes

00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:23,420
into the salaries app and kind of a

00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:25,670
byproduct of being a public repo is that

00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:27,770
we wanted to be both self-documenting

00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:30,890
but also transparent so people can see

00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:32,660
kind of how we walk through cleaning up

00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:34,790
each agency's data set and kind of

00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:38,140
normalizing it into to fit in the kind

00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:41,120
of the modeling that we had done and

00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:44,150
next on our agenda is redoing our public

00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:47,690
schools app if anyone has seen that just

00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:50,330
kind of looking at the looking at data

00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:51,620
for every public school and district in

00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:55,580
the state of texas and letting people

00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:57,320
find their find their school and see

00:36:55,580 --> 00:37:00,380
where it ranks in relation to schools

00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:02,180
near it and would stayed I was actually

00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:04,280
hoping to show some of that here today

00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:06,920
but we've was for I was way too

00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,420
optimistic about both time and also how

00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,810
far we would get along working on that

00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:13,550
so I will just ask everyone to keep an

00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:17,780
out for it in the coming next couple

00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:20,120
months so I'm actually going to fortune

00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:22,490
at the end here so let anyone ask

00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:25,160
questions if they'd like this will be

00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:26,480
making this presentation public and

00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,600
sharing it but these are links to all

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:34,000
the ghetto projects and things that

00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:34,000
mentioned during this and thank you

00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:44,020
Thank You Ryan looks like about two or

00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:46,240
three minutes for questions I have one

00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:47,380
actually yeah since you've been working

00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,140
with all these government agencies over

00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:52,150
the last few years have you noticed any

00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:54,550
like change in behavior on their side

00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:56,770
are they more kind of aware of like

00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:58,180
exporting data you noticed like are they

00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:00,070
getting better at you know being more

00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:02,290
transparent and making data more

00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:06,400
available to the public yeah um it's

00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:08,470
great question um yes and no it's so I

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,210
think that you know our best example of

00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:13,960
this is certainly with the salaries app

00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:15,820
which we've we went through a lot of and

00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,380
I was kind of fortune to be part of a

00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:19,170
lot of those conversations but you know

00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,040
we kind of when we first started that we

00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:23,380
interact with a lot of asians the

00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,910
agencies they just said no like we don't

00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:27,280
that that's not a thing we want to give

00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:29,080
you they actually can't do that as we as

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:33,100
we found that's that's at a public data

00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:35,920
but um and you know it's kind of like

00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:37,360
you know we it's from the best analogy

00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,880
for it is you know we've done the

00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,980
motions enough that you know they kind

00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:45,280
of understand you know okay look what's

00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:46,390
don't don't play the game of oh well

00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,650
that's going to be hard because we've

00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,760
already fought that battle and here's a

00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:52,090
list of everyone who fought that battle

00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,590
with and you're wasting your time and

00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:56,800
here's an AG opinion that we've won that

00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:58,030
battle so you know like when we first

00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,010
were going through a lot of these you

00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:02,470
know we would get like like oh well we

00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:04,420
have a mainframe and and in the state of

00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:06,850
Texas you actually can charge a lot of

00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:08,530
money for for getting open records data

00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:11,140
out of a mainframe it's it's there

00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:13,570
because you have to reserve time and I

00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:16,170
believe it was I want to say was UT

00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:18,250
Dallas and not a hard person on that

00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:22,150
actually wasn't them but it was another

00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:23,710
agency that we like essentially asked we

00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:25,090
got to the point where like prove that

00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:27,430
you actually have a mainframe before you

00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:29,080
charge us you know eight hundred dollars

00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:31,330
and it comes it turned out they did not

00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:33,040
have and did not know that they didn't

00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:36,040
have one which was the most amazing part

00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,570
of that they just it was just a charge

00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:41,770
that they were this knew that they could

00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:43,690
make and no one had ever really pushed

00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:45,010
him on it so a lot of the agencies that

00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:47,530
we you know in arc with now like the

00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:48,820
prisoner database for example that's my

00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:50,320
marine like we that we've already

00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:52,660
like a range that like they know we can

00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,940
get it you know they do charges for we

00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:58,420
pay it's it's it's a transaction that's

00:39:54,940 --> 00:40:01,450
it's understood in general kind of

00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:03,400
across the state I mean I think that I

00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:05,050
think that you know that this is

00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,790
becoming and it's not just in Texas like

00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:08,470
it's becoming more of a thing it's more

00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:12,790
you know people are asking for this data

00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:14,380
not just even in in news outlets and a

00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:16,720
lot of places that we've interacted with

00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:18,250
over the years that used to just you

00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,540
know it kind of float if you don't

00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:22,120
assign someone is your open records

00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:24,490
person it ends up just being like the

00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:26,410
head of the agency and a lot of these

00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:29,860
organizations now have dedicated people

00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:31,900
dedicated teams to fulfilling them so

00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:34,510
again you know we're fortunate that in

00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,860
Texas and this is true in Florida too we

00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:39,100
actually a pretty generous open records

00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:41,080
law it's it's a lot of kind of no one

00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,520
wants to be you know the best way to

00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,230
kind of get back at other people was

00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,670
make things more open when you're in

00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:48,190
politics which is fantastic for

00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:51,790
journalism and we've definitely taken

00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:52,870
advantage of so I think yeah we've you

00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:57,070
know there's there's certainly still

00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:58,870
humps but i think it's it's it's become

00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:00,280
a thing that where we even have agencies

00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:03,070
reaching out to us to kind of like hey

00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:05,020
we want to make this available how can

00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:06,430
we do this better so you know it then

00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:09,010
goal they're wanting to save time and

00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:11,800
money we want to do that too so it's

00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:13,450
it's it's you know I would never say

00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,890
it's a hundred percent there but I

00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:19,860
definitely seen an improvement over the

00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:19,860
past couple years thank you

00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,750
