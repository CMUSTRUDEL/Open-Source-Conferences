Title: DjangoCon US 2015 - Jane Austen on PEP8... by Lacey  Williams Henschel

Description: 
	Jane Austen on PEP8: Tips from an English Major on Writing Better Code

I have two English degrees, and I’ve identified some concrete ways this makes me a better developer. This talk will discuss how we can take lessons from literature to write more readable code, make better tests, and create more usable websites.

I’ll compare Two Scoops of Django to Strunk and White’s The Elements of Style, that familiar freshman comp text, to explore how they are more alike than they are different. We’ll discuss the importance of readability, creating a “story arc” in your tests through good user stories, how variables names have characterization, and the importance of whitespace and good formatting to everyone. I’ll also compare PEP8 to the MLA Handbook; there’s a reason both disciplines have a style guide!

hi all thank you so much for for having

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,410
me I'm really excited to be here so

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,330
let's just get started I'm about me I am

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,830
Lacey I'm a developer for the University

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,109
of Texas where I've been for the past

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,570
four years and now i'm gonna try to slow

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,710
down i'm not gonna talk that fast for

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,969
the rest of the talk it's going to be

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,559
great um but before I became a developer

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,719
I really wanted to be an English

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,600
professor I got my bachelor's degree

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,789
from auburn university in 2007 and while

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,739
i was there i did a lot of tech things i

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,450
was the webmaster for my professors

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,980
website which was maintained in

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,760
Dreamweaver and stored on a zip drive

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,860
those were good days um I also worked in

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,809
the Technology Center where I screen

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,210
casted videos to teach professors how to

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:01,859
use blackboard and which is an online

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,449
course management system if you've not

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,979
if you're not familiar with it and I

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:06,330
also helped them in a great tech into

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,030
their classrooms in ways that I thought

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,799
were cool then because I still wanted to

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,450
become professor Lacey and I wanted to

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,920
teach and write scholarly articles about

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,810
literature like articles about Jane

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,030
Austen I got a master's degree in

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,500
English from Texas A&M University and

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,150
that's just a couple of hours down the

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,909
road in college station if you're not

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,920
familiar with Texas geography again

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:28,320
though I steered myself into more tech

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,640
roles I worked in the technology center

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,409
instead of being a teaching assistant

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,869
which is what you're supposed to do and

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,000
I helped faculty screencast and make

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:37,979
videos and use Moodle which is an

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,270
open-source version of Blackboard but I

00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,640
didn't know what open source was at the

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,290
time I just knew it was free and then I

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,729
also helped them integrate google docs

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,009
as a collaboration tool in their

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,299
classrooms I also worked for an

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,119
organization called the world

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,560
Shakespeare bibliography which takes all

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,850
of the articles they're written about

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,579
Shakespeare and puts them all into one

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,590
place it's pretty cool while i was there

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:00,630
i wrote summaries on these articles but

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,189
i had to use some xml markup so that

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,290
they could be copied and pasted into our

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:07,920
administrative site i didn't know that

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:11,310
that was kind of like coding then in

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,500
2009 I took a workshop on tei the text

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,200
encoding initiative

00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,840
tei is an XML markup language that's

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,190
specific to manuscripts so this is an

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,320
example of what it looks like on the

00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:23,660
left you have what is being transcribed

00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,940
and on the right you have the tei xml

00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,410
markup and there's also some links at

00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,610
the end of the presentation and i'll

00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,470
post these slides online so if you're

00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,480
really interested in tei you can dive

00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,190
deep into that it has these really

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,780
awesome and specific tags for

00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,730
manuscripts so there's a tag for the

00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,010
publisher the day the author the title

00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,690
but then you can do really neat stuff

00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,420
for written manuscripts so like there's

00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:46,430
a way to represent in markup that Mark

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,840
Twain scratched through a line and then

00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,450
wrote something else above it which is

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,000
really neat I wanted to make a site

00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:55,550
using te I whenever I was in grad school

00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,680
to talk about Jane Austen fan fiction

00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:01,700
and that's actually a really rich world

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,709
you intimately and I'm not going to go

00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,600
too far into that but i will just very

00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:07,310
briefly tell you that um there are these

00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,930
like Twitter accounts where people will

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,730
will become the different characters

00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:13,190
from Pride and Prejudice for example and

00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:16,280
they will like over a period of time act

00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:18,650
out the entire novel and it's really fun

00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,810
people get into this so like you think

00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,130
that you know your gaming or dragoncon

00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,850
or whatever and you haven't met these

00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:27,410
Jane Austen people that is real phantom

00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,900
um but I didn't know how to make a

00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:31,730
website I was really tech inclined and

00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,799
tech interested but I didn't think of

00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,790
myself as tech savvy despite like

00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:36,799
everything I've told you about all the

00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,480
tech things that I was doing I didn't

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,459
know how to register a URL I didn't

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,049
understand what CSS was and if there

00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:44,180
were tutorials out there I didn't know

00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:47,209
where they were I wish that I could go

00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,170
back and mentor myself in 2010 and I was

00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:49,730
telling Barbara about this this morning

00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:52,220
because now there's the Django girls

00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,540
tutorial and I could say 2010 Lacey you

00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,190
should do this because Django would be

00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,470
perfect for what you want to do but I

00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,989
didn't know that I had impostor syndrome

00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:01,850
before I even got started so instead of

00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:04,040
doing my amazing website on Jane Austen

00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:06,260
fanfiction I wrote a paper on Jane

00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,570
Austen fan fiction and with that I got a

00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,130
digital humanities certificate which is

00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:13,370
still ironic to me that that even was

00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:15,170
allowed to happen um this talk Jane

00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,940
Austen on Pepe do is sort of my do-over

00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,650
it's a chance for me to talk about

00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,690
literature and tech in one place which

00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:22,099
I've never gotten to do before so this

00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:24,380
is for the other English majors that

00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:26,040
performs the lovers of literature the

00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,750
people with humanities degrees who

00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,080
trouble with that question so do you

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,550
ever use your history degree it's also

00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,990
for the people who have asked that

00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,880
question of their colleagues that don't

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,620
have stemmed backgrounds who've been

00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,360
confused about how someone might start

00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,790
out a psychology major and wind up

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,290
writing Python the truth is that the

00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,780
technology world and the humanities

00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:47,310
world are not very far apart a lot of

00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,350
the concepts that English majors have

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,600
perfected over years of writing thesis

00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:54,150
papers we do use in our daily lives as

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,100
developers this talk isn't really about

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,470
what coders can learn from humanities

00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,030
majors or vice versa it's more a

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,890
demonstration of the overlap between

00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,120
those two disciplines and a study and

00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:07,260
their compatibility and how they

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,090
complement one another so this is a game

00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,590
called guess the source I put up a quote

00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,540
from a style guide and you guess where

00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,980
it comes from and this is the the Jane

00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,360
Austen handwritten thought which means

00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,570
it's a little bit difficult to read but

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,880
I just couldn't resist so it says always

00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:28,100
use two spaces after a sentence ending

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:28,100
period any guesses actually pep eight

00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,620
whoo yeah so that's kind of the first

00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,150
clue that writing code has anything to

00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,430
do with writing a research paper or an

00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:41,190
essay pet fate also says when writing

00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:42,780
English follow Strunk and white and Pepe

00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,280
doesn't even cite Strunk and white it

00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,290
never actually says the elements of

00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,840
style it just assumes that you know what

00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:50,820
that means so if you don't know what we

00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,230
mean when we say Strunk and white Strunk

00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,580
and white refers to a book called The

00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,770
Elements of Style which got shouted out

00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,390
out here it's an American English style

00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,760
guide that was first published in

00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,950
nineteen fifty-nine now I hate this

00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,720
particular line from pet bait because in

00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:06,570
your regular writing you should never do

00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,490
this this is this is from the days of

00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,810
mono spaced font and typesetting and we

00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,450
don't use monospaced fonts on the

00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,340
internet or in our publishing anymore

00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:15,990
except in code so you should follow this

00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,940
rule when you're writing code but you

00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,530
should break it everywhere else my

00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,540
broader point about Strunk and white

00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:23,970
though is that it's a guide written to

00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,890
help people write clearer more concise

00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:28,860
more consistent and more readable

00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:31,230
English Pepe is a guide for helping

00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:35,370
people write clearer more concise more

00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:37,160
consistent and more readable code so

00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,360
let's talk about plot driven development

00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,889
let's talk about testing

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,569
testing is a perfect example of where

00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:45,060
some concepts from your literature class

00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:47,099
can come in handy so you might remember

00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,960
this from your like you know great books

00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:50,639
101 or something but this is Freitag's

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,879
pyramid and this is just a basic

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,650
illustration of a story arc you have

00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:57,539
exposition which is where you learn who

00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:59,759
the characters are where you're at and

00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:01,620
the basics of what's happening you have

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,300
the rising action which is where the

00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,219
problem gets introduced and we start

00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,770
experiencing the events that lead us to

00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:09,900
the climax now this the climax is the

00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,789
most exciting part of the plot this is

00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,830
where the thing happens that changes the

00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:15,539
main characters fate so in Pride and

00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,849
Prejudice this is the scene where mr.

00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:19,319
Darcy finally proposes to Elizabeth but

00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:21,029
she says that she would not marry him if

00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,729
he were the last man on earth and then

00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:25,409
she starts to question herself and the

00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:27,449
falling action is when things begin to

00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:28,710
unravel and fall into place so we figure

00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:31,259
out that mr. Darcy's actually a nice guy

00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,759
he did her family this huge favor and

00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:34,349
then we have the day new ma where they

00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,779
get married and everything is tied up in

00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:39,870
a neat little bow we can make use of

00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:42,000
this arc in testing as well in fact that

00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:44,279
was the idea that that was where I got

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,870
the idea for this talk i was at PyCon

00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:48,479
earlier this year and i was in harry

00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:50,009
Percival's i'm testing tutorial and i

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,900
realized that the example of a

00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:54,210
functional test that he gave was an

00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,949
example of a plot so this is a more

00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,750
formal version of my answer to a

00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:59,129
question i got after that tutorial when

00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,839
i was chatting with someone told them I

00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:03,960
had an English degree and they said so

00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:05,699
do you ever use your English degree so

00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,860
inherit Percival's example of a

00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:10,830
functional test he takes us through the

00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,560
plot or the pyramid of someone's journey

00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:16,050
through this sample to-do list app his

00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,180
example has exposition he introduces us

00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:21,389
to Edith who has heard about this fancy

00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,849
to-do list app it has rising action

00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:25,770
Edith locates the app she goes in she

00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:27,210
finds her way around and she makes a

00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:30,360
decision that she's going to enter an

00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:34,099
item then there's the climax Edith's

00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,099
fate is forever changed

00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:39,970
she forms she performs the crucial

00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:42,790
pivotal action of adding an item to her

00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:45,040
to-do list there's the following action

00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:47,320
she's entered the item she sees that

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,390
it's been entered and saved and then the

00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,720
day numa Edith is happy and she goes

00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:55,180
back to sleep before harry ever writes a

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,490
single actual functional test he writes

00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:01,180
out this whole story that follows that

00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:03,160
plot arc this way he knows what path the

00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,960
user needs to take through his site what

00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,300
they'll encounter what they'll do and

00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,160
how it will all resolve he can write

00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,390
test to test that these steps happen and

00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,010
then he writes the code to pass that

00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:14,320
test we all know what testing is so um

00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:17,050
the path that Edith takes through the

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,930
app though that's her plot and Edith is

00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,910
a character in another world Edith might

00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,100
be the protagonist in a novel and this

00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,810
particular journey might be a chapter in

00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,630
what I hope is an otherwise more

00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:30,460
thrilling story the ability to write a

00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,020
complete and convincing user story

00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,400
though is helped by having studied

00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,470
character development and plot

00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,210
development a programmer it needs to be

00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,340
confident in what their code is supposed

00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:41,170
to do and in what order that's supposed

00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:44,530
to happen in order to effectively test

00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:46,360
it and user stories and functional tests

00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:48,010
are not the end of the story how do we

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,290
want Edith to react whenever the app

00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:51,820
breaks do we want her to tear her hair

00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,640
and rent her garments like she's in a

00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,230
Greek tragedy I certainly hope not we

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,610
probably want to provide her with the

00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,800
tools that she needs to correct the

00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,390
error if possible or reassure her that

00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,340
we know that something went wrong and

00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,530
we're already on it so then we have this

00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,580
more reassuring error message that again

00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,470
I'll read for you because I just love

00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:11,290
this font but it's not readable dear

00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:13,800
readable or sorry dear reader

00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:18,130
we regret that an error has been made

00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:19,660
warmly the programmers it takes some

00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,759
creative thinking to know where our code

00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,410
might break to build in checks for that

00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,959
and to return something useful to our

00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:27,759
user any programmer can return the error

00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,920
message assertion error false is not

00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,899
true but it takes some creative thinking

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,550
as well as those excellent written and

00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:35,170
verbal communication skills that you see

00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,600
in job postings but you never know quite

00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:39,910
what they need to compose an error

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,639
message that is helpful not intimidating

00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:44,769
and is confidence inspiring when you're

00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,050
writing good tests you're doing world

00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:49,209
building accessibility for example

00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:51,699
requires empathy and empathy requires

00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:53,259
imagination you can leverage that

00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:55,060
awesome feeling you get when you get

00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:56,589
really lost in a book and you identify

00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,540
with the main characters super closely

00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:01,029
into putting yourself in the shoes of

00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:03,100
your user imagine their struggles their

00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:05,199
frustrations create a persona for them

00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,970
and fix the things that hinder them or

00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:09,130
annoy them about their app about your

00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:12,069
app and let them continue on their

00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:14,290
journey but back to the functional tests

00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:16,050
so this is a screenshot from Harry's

00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:18,010
book test-driven development in Python

00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,510
specifically it's all of the comments

00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:22,720
that he's written out so that he knows

00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,860
what tests he needs to add the this also

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,970
looks like something else though that

00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:28,990
you may remember from your college

00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:31,630
English classes an outline it has

00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:33,250
specific ideas in a specific order they

00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:36,060
relate to each other in a specific way

00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:39,760
and that looks like something else

00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:42,220
basically all Python code Python loves

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,170
white fate white space and indenting and

00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:48,760
pretty formatting even more than the

00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:50,380
average English major Python uses a lot

00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,690
of the same formatting as many other

00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,699
written works like new stories blog

00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,620
posts novels research papers even

00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:58,269
recipes like this one which is Emily

00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,910
Dickinson's handwritten coconut cake

00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:02,410
recipe your function definition is like

00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,060
the title and to convince you of that

00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,589
even further you should really check out

00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,600
Jacob birches talk on naming things

00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:08,920
tomorrow I'm not going to spend a lot of

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,680
time on naming things because that's

00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,389
what he's here for your doc string you

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,550
can think of is like the abstract to a

00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:17,889
research paper or the forward to a new

00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:19,510
edition of a favorite novel it tells you

00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:21,130
a little bit about what's coming it

00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:23,410
gives you a peek into the author or the

00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:25,120
programmers mind then there's everything

00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,250
in the middle there's the meat of your

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,770
function the paragraphs of the article

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:32,290
or the story and finally you conclude

00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:33,790
you return something and your journey

00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,770
through this particular function is over

00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,870
a well written piece of code will be

00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:39,670
readable but what do we even mean by

00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:42,490
that machines don't need code to be

00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,630
readable but then we have this the Zen

00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:45,820
of Python is pretty clear that

00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,589
readability counts the computer or

00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,589
compiler doesn't care if your code is a

00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:53,050
mess but your colleagues care the people

00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:54,970
who come after you care the people who

00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:57,670
share in your work need your code to be

00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:59,400
readable it takes caring about your

00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:01,960
fellow coder to write readable code

00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:04,210
readable and conscientiously commented

00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,920
code also helps future programmers

00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:07,600
understand what you struggled with or

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,210
why you made decisions the way that you

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,310
did a friend of mine once said comments

00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:14,020
are like love notes to yourself another

00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,550
co-worker likes to say that comments are

00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,870
what keep you saying at three o'clock in

00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,370
the morning when you get a phone call

00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:21,190
that something has gone catastrophic

00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:23,170
alee wrong now there's a great example

00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:24,700
of this from a contemporary series that

00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:27,010
some of you might have read it's the

00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,800
Outlander series this is basically my

00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:31,330
perfect book series it's about a world

00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,300
war two nurse who accidentally time

00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:37,180
travels back to 18th century Scotland

00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:38,770
it's amazing there's war and there was

00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,540
romance and there's wonderfulness and

00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:42,520
it's a pretty great TV series too but

00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,020
none of that is the point I'm not going

00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,580
to spoil anything but i will say that at

00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,980
the end of book 5 this is like an eighth

00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,450
book series our heroine Claire is in

00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,130
18th century and she's the most

00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,320
knowledgeable medical professional for a

00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:55,209
miles she treats someone who winds up

00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,830
dying and she's pretty sure it's because

00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:58,839
she gave the patient something that they

00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:00,400
were allergic to and she struggles with

00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,690
whether to write this down in her

00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,940
medical journal where she keeps records

00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:06,010
of all of her patients because in a

00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,270
different book she was tried as a witch

00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,490
because they thought that her medical

00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,600
amazingness was actually witchcraft so

00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:13,000
she doesn't want to write something down

00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,610
it could be used against her she says

00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,529
this and I quote some future physician

00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:19,600
here would face the same dilemma to

00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:21,550
undertake a possibly dangerous treatment

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,650
or to allow a patient to die who might

00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:25,839
have been saved who might that be and

00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:27,640
then she thinks for a while about how

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,050
isolated she is about how there aren't

00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,610
very many doctors and there aren't

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:33,070
really very many medical schools and

00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:35,560
then she concludes i SAT up straight and

00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:37,060
opened my book I dipped my pen and began

00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,440
to write the lines that must be there

00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:41,020
for the sake of the

00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,420
known physician who would follow me now

00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:45,190
we're not saving lives here but this is

00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:48,820
why we write readable code for the sake

00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:50,290
of that unknown coder who follows us so

00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,330
when I was in college I had a roommate

00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,590
who was a journalism major and she and I

00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:56,080
would always edit each other's papers

00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:57,910
and I would invariably try to get her to

00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,890
use more adjectives to make her writing

00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:02,020
more exciting and she would tell me to

00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:07,000
cut my flowery descriptions and get to

00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:08,920
the point she was right these next few

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,150
slides are edicts from pep 20 and Strunk

00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,070
and white and I'm not going to specify

00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:14,200
which line is from which work because it

00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:16,900
doesn't matter the point is that they're

00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,550
so similar good writing is concise and

00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,320
clear and simple and gets to its point

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,360
whether you're writing a piece of code

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,890
or an article I could take the lines

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,960
from the Zen of Python that aren't

00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,310
specific to code and email them to my

00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,630
friends who are now English professors

00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:30,010
and they could just hand them out right

00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:32,760
now to their classes and they would be

00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:35,290
better for it in fact I should do that

00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,780
so much of what makes the Zen of Python

00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:39,310
great is its universality my favorite

00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:41,230
line is complex is better than

00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:43,630
complicated not because I struggle with

00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:46,060
writing code that is complex and instead

00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:48,130
of complicated but i do but it's because

00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:50,650
it speaks to the writer in me it's

00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:52,540
really hard to explain a complicated

00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,980
idea or to come around to an important

00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:57,970
point at the end of a long thought

00:15:53,980 --> 00:16:00,100
journey I got a little lost there that's

00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:04,420
cool I made it like a long time without

00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:06,610
doing that it's been it's why it's why a

00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:09,310
good editor and a good code review are

00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:10,750
both so valuable to us as writers and

00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:13,150
anyone who's a fan of Game of Thrones

00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:16,480
knows how thin the line between complex

00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:18,100
and complicated can be so what would

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,430
happen if we didn't call ourselves

00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:25,030
coders or programmers or developers what

00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:28,270
do we do all day we write code we read

00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:32,440
comments we write tests we read pull

00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:34,540
requests we write a lot of things we're

00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,190
readers and we're writers the lessons

00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,839
that we learned in classes about reading

00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:39,910
and writing literature are exceedingly

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,790
relevant to us as readers and writers of

00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:45,280
code so do you ever get to use your

00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:47,470
English degree I get asked that all the

00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:52,589
time and i use my english degree every

00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:52,589
day and then I have some sources so

00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:17,520
and I will take questions so if you have

00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:19,709
questions feel free thanks it's great

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,560
great talk um are you familiar with

00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:24,270
literate programming no okay so literate

00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,940
programming was something that Donald

00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:29,640
louth who's a big CS preserve professor

00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:31,230
came up with the idea that the

00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,540
documentation for code and the code

00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,460
should be the same thing and effectively

00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,920
you can you compile it to documentation

00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:40,050
you compile it to code as well your

00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,280
thoughts in terms of do you think that

00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,990
it should actually be at that level of

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,760
verbosity that level of engagement

00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:47,730
between the code you're writing and

00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,960
what's being is there or is in your

00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:53,190
opinion as someone who's coming from a

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:55,710
humanities the code literate enough to

00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:58,440
occur to express what's going on so I

00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,670
know um and I knew that someone was

00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,070
going to say like well don't you think

00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:04,140
that you know code should be self

00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:07,080
documenting and and it should that's

00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,670
true right but that's not always what

00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,350
happens and I know that we've all

00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:12,210
maintained those legacy systems where

00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:14,370
maybe once upon a time that code was

00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:18,000
self documenting that time is past that

00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:19,860
time is over now and we are now at a new

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,730
era where we have no idea what this code

00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,200
does and no one wants to touch it

00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:26,970
because it works but we have no idea why

00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:28,290
um ideally ideally our code would-be

00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:30,270
self documenting and there would be no

00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:33,120
need for you know hashes that had

00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:34,470
comments after them I however think that

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,110
especially whenever you're writing that

00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:38,850
really complex code that is responding

00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,080
to a really difficult problem or a

00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,910
really difficult idea that took you

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,070
awhile or whenever you're doing

00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:45,900
something new for the first time it's

00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:48,120
nice to leave someone or yourself

00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,240
breadcrumbs that say like this is what i

00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,380
meant to do this is what this code does

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,140
this is what I was thinking this is how

00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,490
I got here and and I I think that

00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:59,040
leaving those breadcrumbs is a kind

00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:01,200
thing to do i'm pro comments and even

00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,460
being pro comments i still get comments

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,130
and code review like why don't you

00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,380
document that like UT is very pro like

00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:09,510
you should add a comment to tell us what

00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,390
you meant here especially since at a

00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:13,410
larger institution there are so many

00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,470
different kinds like different we're all

00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:16,090
a little tiny silo

00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,370
business rules and so everyone has

00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:22,120
slightly different things that they have

00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:23,559
to think about um but yes I do believe

00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,789
that good code is self documenting I I

00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:37,450
think that that's not always the code

00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:41,260
that we wind up writing fellow English

00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:44,860
major yeah I see more of us know my only

00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:46,419
comment about I mean the complexity

00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,919
versus what was it complexity versus

00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:49,990
complex versus complicated look at

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,840
complex numbers is complicated and that

00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:55,030
is one of the reasons why to become a

00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,220
writer professionally was because well

00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,390
for one I didn't do it every day which

00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,730
is of course what they tell you have to

00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:02,980
do right but I think at the English

00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:05,350
language though is it's like there's a

00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,210
struggle we become really jargon eyes

00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:08,950
and so it's really hard for people to

00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:11,620
express themselves and actually mean

00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:13,240
something because what the dargah means

00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,090
to your particular corner of the world

00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:19,000
is not what it means in mine and so I

00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:20,470
like to think of words it's like how we

00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,940
build a query set it's like every time

00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:24,220
you add a modifier to it you're

00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,539
modifying the results I mean they're

00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,710
subtle there might be a subtle

00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:28,960
difference but that could be a very

00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:30,010
significant difference so it's like I

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,220
would just add that you know it

00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:35,409
encouraged to you know brevity is not

00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:39,309
necessarily you know always the soul of

00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:40,990
virtue and and it's another idea but

00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:42,940
 bye-bye you should go to Jacobs

00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,929
talk tomorrow I've seen his we wanted to

00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,549
make sure that we didn't have too much

00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:46,900
overlap so we know a little bit about

00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:48,250
each other's talk so I've seen his notes

00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,140
and I think that you would particularly

00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:52,900
enjoy it but but yeah I think that

00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:54,640
there's there's a tension between um you

00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,850
know being accurate and being briefed

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,950
and sometimes sometimes being fully

00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:02,940
accurate means using maybe more words

00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,940
than you would like to UM

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,510
are there any are there any other

00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,890
questions if you would like the Micra

00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:24,180
the microphone can come to you you do

00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:24,180
not have to come to the microphone I

00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:33,600
also I'll repeat the question for that

00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:49,780
so one bit that I struggle a lot with is

00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:53,650
coming up with useful intuitive names

00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:57,040
for classes and functions because to

00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:58,690
make them manageable in the code I want

00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:02,080
to keep them nice and shortened like

00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:03,940
just one or two words and to make them

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,800
accurately describe what they want to do

00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:13,480
I want to basically put the doc string

00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:16,750
in the name um and this I this is not

00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:19,330
just me I've came up in someone's talk

00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:21,250
yesterday that Django has a couple of

00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:23,580
things called meta and a couple of

00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:26,820
things called options that aren't like

00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:29,820
so there's multiple meta options

00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:34,930
combinations that you might run into

00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:37,240
it's all your fault no um anyway so what

00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:39,280
guidelines can you give us on that so

00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,990
and again I'm pitching Jacobs talk so

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,940
much his talk is like exactly that um

00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:46,120
like so if you if you want to know about

00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,380
how to name things better or how to what

00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,910
kind of guidelines to have you should

00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:51,070
check out Jacob birches talk tomorrow

00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:54,610
the other hard problem lessons and

00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:58,060
advice on naming things um in for me I i

00:22:54,610 --> 00:23:00,040
will say I struggle with that too um I i

00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:05,410
think for function names were for

00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:07,090
variable names or class names it's you

00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:10,960
want it to be accurate but you also

00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:13,120
don't want it to you know 65 bites of

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:17,650
your ad character limit is your you're

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:23,620
functioning exactly right yeah

00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:25,000
um so um it's hard and practice and I

00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,380
think you kind of get used and I think

00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,870
it's easy to get down that trail right

00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:30,730
you have like the one class that is

00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,960
pretty straightforward and then you have

00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:33,430
the other class that maybe inherits from

00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,040
that or is referring to that in some way

00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:37,510
so you name it in reference to and then

00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,620
you name another thing in reference to

00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,970
and then you name another thing in

00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:42,460
reference to and then it's just like

00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:44,230
turtles all the way down and and then

00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,630
you have these incredibly long names and

00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:50,230
so at some point um I think it can be

00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:51,550
better to maybe try to think is I think

00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:54,100
a lot of times whenever that happens

00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:55,750
it's because you're naming something in

00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,550
reference to something else and so you

00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,720
want to say you know this function is

00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,920
different from this other function in

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,890
this way and that's like your function

00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,540
name and if you can kind of sense that

00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:06,580
pattern or sense that that's what you're

00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:08,560
doing maybe you can kind of back

00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,600
yourself up a little bit and that's not

00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,920
the only wow that's not the only way

00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,690
that we wind up with really long names

00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:16,180
but that's one of the ways i noticed in

00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:18,610
myself is that that's the way i wind up

00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:20,830
with two long names is I'm just

00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:26,080
referring and then referring and then

00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:31,140
referring all right thank you for a

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:33,790
lovely talk um I so so good good English

00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:36,940
evolves over time right or at least I

00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:39,730
believe that I know some people so good

00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:41,260
English writing evolves and yet I I'm

00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:43,420
not intimately familiar with the way

00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:47,440
perhaps work but i believe pepe just

00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:49,390
sits there right inert do you think that

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,400
the way we write code and our coding

00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:54,880
style should evolve over time and how do

00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:57,910
we go about doing that i think that it

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,350
can um and I can buy one hundred percent

00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,940
i know a lot of English majors don't

00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:03,010
necessarily agree I agree that good

00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:04,750
English evolves over time and that's why

00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:06,430
i say y'all you know I have a master's

00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:13,810
in English I think y'all is the perfect

00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:17,190
plural pronoun thank you if I've given

00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:20,320
any message today it's the gospel of God

00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:22,570
but no and I don't know the particulars

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,220
about how peps get changed or like can

00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:28,270
you submit a PR against a pep I have no

00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:30,460
idea I my guess is kind of probably

00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,690
technically but not really but I think

00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,700
those are discussions that we should

00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:35,440
have and I think that whenever like when

00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,580
it comes to like this is enough Python I

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,890
think that so much of that is really

00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:40,540
timeless maybe they're there are

00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:42,610
probably a couple of lines in the design

00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:44,320
of Python that could that that would be

00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:45,610
things that maybe could could be changed

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,010
over time or a couple of things in like

00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:51,130
Pepe that could that might be less

00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:53,410
relevant over time or maybe we decide

00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:55,390
that we don't want you know to full

00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:57,940
space like two lines after a particular

00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:00,310
kind of thing anymore those standards

00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:01,720
change and but they change over usage to

00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:04,390
a part of the way the English changes is

00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,280
through usage and so as people wind up

00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:07,570
doing different things and like the

00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,280
thing that I hope changes like the 80

00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:11,500
line lengths like the 80 bite thing that

00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,880
is you know although there are still

00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,870
some people at UT who we're still on a

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,730
mainframe so we actually do have

00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:17,350
programmers who do develop in those

00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:19,060
environments where it's it's a hard 80

00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:20,560
and but most of us aren't in those

00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:25,720
environments anymore so 80 seems a

00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:27,280
little harsh to me um so yeah we can all

00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,720
band together to make like a working

00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:33,010
group to talk about the 80 line length

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:38,790
if we want to we have time for one more

00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:38,790
