	Wagtail - Yet Another Django CMS by Tom Dyson

Wagtail was launched in February 2014, shortly after its first implementation for the Royal College of Art. It has been enthusiastically received by Django developers around the world, and now powers sites for small businesses, UN agencies, and global brands in tech, political and entertainment sectors. Tom will explain why his agency decided to build a new CMS, share some lessons learned in running a growing open source project, and outline Wagtail's roadmap to version 2 and beyond.
