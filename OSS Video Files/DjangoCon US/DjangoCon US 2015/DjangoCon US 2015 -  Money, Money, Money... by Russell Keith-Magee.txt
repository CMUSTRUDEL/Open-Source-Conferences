Description: 
	Money, Money, Money - Writing software, in a rich (wo)man's world

Free software advocates talk about two types of "Free": Free as in freedom, and Free as in beer. While Free (as in freedom) software is unquestionably better for users and developers alike, Free (as in beer) software doesn't pay the bills.

Talk to any prominent open source developer, and amongst the success stories, you'll also hear some consistent troubles - that they've got great ideas and grand plans, but no time to execute; that they're about to burn out due to the pressues of maintaining their project; or that they've had yet another mailing list discussion with someone who doesn't understand they're a volunteer. All of these problems stem from a fundamental disconnect: the discrepancy between the clear demand for a software product, and the ability to convert that demand into time needed to service that demand - and that means money.

all right thank you very much I said hi

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,670
yeah I'm Russell Keith McGee if you've

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:25,500
heard of me before it's probably because

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,760
of my work on the Django project I've

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,410
been a quarter team member there for ten

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,720
years of proving president of the Django

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,710
software foundation since 2011 one of

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,930
the big challenges of the Django project

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,000
and any big open source project for that

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,940
matter is has been to secure a certainty

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,190
in its long-term development future my

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,809
day job is as CTO and co-founder of

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,820
trades cloud where our software as a

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,309
service for trades people plumbers

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,899
electricians carpenters people like that

00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:50,940
trades cloud depends on a number of open

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,460
source projects django Apache memcache

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,980
countless others so I've got a business

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,780
interest in the continuity of these open

00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,460
source projects but I certainly don't

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,789
have the resources to fund them all

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,189
myself I've also got declared interest

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:06,960
in user interface and GUI tools

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:08,640
especially as they relate to development

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,260
tools I've got all sorts of grand

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,360
visions about what I'd like to do with

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,530
the be ware project and I've received

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,600
some great contributions from the

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,060
community but it's still largely my own

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,770
work but my startup would be able make

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,890
great use of these tools if they were

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,659
mature and also the maintainer of some

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,790
smaller projects like the Python wrapper

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,040
to the zero API I started the project

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,880
because I had an itch my itch has now

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,439
been scratched

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,790
but I've open-source the project which

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,189
means I've kind of inherited this

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,689
maintenance task I've accepted help from

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:38,250
a number of people most notably Matthew

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:40,500
Schinkel and Aidan list I've done some

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,140
great work but if I'm completely honest

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,090
the maintenance burden of Pi zero

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,439
massively exceeds the amount of time

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,130
that I personally can reasonably

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:52,020
dedicate to it so I've got vested

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,909
interests in free software I've got

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,530
interests in free software as a producer

00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,930
of a successful project with a high

00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,850
profile as the producer of a small

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,070
project with lots of users but very

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,570
little personal incentive and as a

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,430
producer of smaller projects with almost

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,770
no profile but all sorts of really grand

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,780
plans and these projects all have

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:13,200
different resourcing needs reflecting

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,960
their maturity as projects I've also got

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,820
interests as a

00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,950
humor of free software both in terms of

00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,480
the software that I rely upon to develop

00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,070
my own projects and in terms of my

00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,660
commercial interest in the long term

00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,880
maintenance of tools and platforms that

00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,770
I use I need these platforms and these

00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,140
projects to continue to develop to

00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:30,520
survive and thrive

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,280
based on my experience I'd like to make

00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,750
a very bold social assertion absent of

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,340
any other constraints given equivalent

00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,290
resources free software or the free

00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,480
software approach produces a vastly

00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:43,210
superior outcome than the closed source

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,900
approach the catch here is the operative

00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:49,000
Clause given equivalent resources most

00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,830
free software projects aren't developed

00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,660
using anything close to equivalent

00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:55,420
resources of their closed source

00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,010
counterparts now in some cases this is a

00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,290
blessing in disguise regardless of the

00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,540
process of the project having scarce

00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,670
resources is an excellent crucible for

00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:06,520
burning away the unnecessary to leave

00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:09,340
just the base metal but it's not always

00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,660
a blessing talk to any prominent free

00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,280
software developer and amongst the

00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,710
success stories you'll also hear some

00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,050
really consistent troubles that they've

00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:19,210
got really great ideas and grand plans

00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,770
but no time to execute that they're

00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,840
about to burn out due to the pressures

00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,070
of maintaining their project whether

00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,270
they've had yet another mailing this

00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,590
discussion with someone who doesn't

00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,880
understand why you didn't drop

00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,830
everything to help them fix their

00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,650
problem and there are plenty of examples

00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:34,540
of this OpenSSL is the software that

00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,820
drives pretty much every secure

00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,080
connection on the internet and yet it

00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,640
took the discovery of heartbleed a

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,800
critical vulnerability that sent the

00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,270
internet into a tailspin before they

00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,210
could find funding to pay for

00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:48,460
maintenance another example the new PG

00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:50,740
van akak almost went bankrupt trying to

00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:53,290
support GPG a project that many other

00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,840
projects depend upon for their trust in

00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:57,250
their release process Vela was was

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,480
rescued at death's door by the Linux

00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,670
Foundation's core infrastructure

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,020
initiative now those are both examples

00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,790
that ended with happy endings with

00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,830
funding but it's not all happy endings

00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:08,020
take the example of Capistrano was a

00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:10,300
hugely popular configuration management

00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:13,180
tool around 2007-2008 maintained by

00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,920
Thomas Bach in 2008 citing burnout and

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,630
maintenance overhead he famously

00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,760
withdrew support for Windows saying

00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,770
windows may be the 800-pound gorilla in

00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,860
the room but it's not my gorilla and

00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:26,650
it's not my room this was an incredibly

00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,240
unpopular move amongst Windows users but

00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,030
with the scale down that came with that

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,440
German chemist burnt out in 2009

00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,970
abandoning Capistrano wholesale and a

00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,340
number of other projects without

00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,169
maintenance

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,419
the thing is though this is a community

00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:41,860
that has lots of cash in the grand

00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:44,560
scheme of things software development is

00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,449
a well-funded industry if companies can

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,030
find money for football tables and

00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:50,620
meditative ball pits they should be able

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,120
to find resources to help maintain the

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,160
software which they're based their

00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,199
success and if you're on the receiving

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,610
end of the problem a developer of free

00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:00,639
software that can be really frustrating

00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,169
and for me this is the really big

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,699
unanswered question of the free software

00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:05,830
movement how to reconcile the

00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:07,570
discrepancy between the clear demand for

00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,639
a software product and the ability to

00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,400
convert that demand into the time and

00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:14,320
resources needed to service the demand

00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,970
now okay all this in theory the theory

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,639
says everyone can contribute to a free

00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:20,470
software project in reality every single

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,870
sort of project of any significance has

00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,120
leaders and at the most basic level its

00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,650
whoever has the commit bit and you need

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,690
that leadership especially when you do

00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,490
anything where designers involved the

00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,380
running gag is that a camel is a horse

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,570
designed by committee the very worst

00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,919
api's we deal with on a daily basis are

00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:38,320
the ones that were designed by committee

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,560
you need someone with taste running the

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,330
show but there's a bigger problem

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,550
there's the extent of the engagement

00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,720
that users have with a project here's a

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,099
thought experiment to prove the point

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,370
we're in a room full of Python users

00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:53,229
Django is a free software project who in

00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,760
this room has found a bug in Django or

00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:56,800
has a niggling thing that they'd like to

00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,229
see fixed with a Django API the show

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,419
hands okay we're looking to puppy about

00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:04,419
half the room who's turned that nickel

00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:05,740
into a bug report in Django most of

00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:07,300
those okay that's pretty good who

00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,760
submitted a patch to Django for that

00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,349
niggle yeah okay so we're down to about

00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,289
a third of what was left there of those

00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:15,490
who've had that patch committed okay a

00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:17,280
couple is it's been a better than better

00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,150
results than I got in Python Australia

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,530
so what's going on here we've had a

00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,669
massive scale down from people who say

00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,710
they have a problem then the people who

00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:25,270
have had that problem fixed well what's

00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,010
going on here it reflects two different

00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:29,830
ways of looking at a piece of software

00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:32,199
projects and products and it's a matter

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,900
of personal perspective my project can

00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:36,460
be your product and vice versa when I

00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,870
look at a piece of code as a project

00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,460
it's a body of code where I'm

00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,030
contributing to a larger goal I'm

00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,070
willing

00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:43,990
spend my resources focusing on other

00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,280
people's needs in the hope that their

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,210
needs will help make the project as a

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,650
whole better

00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,330
I'm willing to do this because I get

00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:51,430
some personal gain like an enhanced

00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,740
public profile or if the tool was really

00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,210
close to my work coalface or if I know

00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,750
that I can make a really substantive

00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:00,550
contribution but the further I get away

00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,860
from my coal face the harder it is to

00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,390
make a contribution the less inclined I

00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,640
am to even want to contribute to a

00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:09,280
project most of the time it's a product

00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,440
that I'm using what's in all if a

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,090
product has bugs I work around them I

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,160
find an alternative rather than

00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:18,490
navigating the contribution process to

00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,590
contribute a patch back upstream in the

00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:23,050
case of a product the freedoms that are

00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,910
afforded by free software are a bit like

00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:27,160
freedom of speech it's a freedom I most

00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:29,170
definitely watch it's comforting to know

00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,780
that it's there but I don't spend every

00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:34,090
day making sure that I fully exploit the

00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,130
extents of those freedoms there are

00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:37,660
people who do protestors advocates for

00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,250
controversial social positions and one

00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,710
day given the right circumstances I

00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,480
might join in and help them but most of

00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:46,720
the time I just want to be pragmatic and

00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:49,150
get on with living the dichotomy between

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,980
the theory and the practice is also the

00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,720
reason why comments like patches welcome

00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,940
get made in free software mailing lists

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,370
on the one hand it's completely correct

00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,020
anyone can contribute to an open-source

00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:02,350
project and our most projects patches

00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,850
are welcome but most people don't look

00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,380
at a new open-source project as an

00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,270
opportunity to engage with the

00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:10,570
development process most people just

00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:11,800
want to use the damn software and you

00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,270
can argue that this is because people

00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,040
are focusing on the wrong interpretation

00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:17,380
of free and haven't captured the spirit

00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,960
of free software and again that's 100%

00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,780
true but utterly counterproductive as a

00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,830
position anyone who's done anywhere ux

00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,450
work knows that if users are

00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,460
consistently making a mistake with your

00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:29,350
user interface blaming the user gets you

00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:31,180
nowhere you are in charge of what the

00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,010
user experienced they made the error

00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:36,820
because of a fundamental cognitive

00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:38,530
disconnect and even if everyone did get

00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,960
the right message let's be realistic

00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,340
it wouldn't work anyway mythical

00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,440
man-month showed us you can't deliver a

00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:46,510
project faster by throwing more people

00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,970
at it 9 women can't make a baby in one

00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:51,040
month a project doesn't just need

00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:53,560
resources it needs the right resources

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,160
in the right quantities and ultimately

00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,629
that means

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,279
the project finding a way to get the

00:08:55,629 --> 00:09:00,430
resources they need to be

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,079
self-sustaining so that means if you

00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,459
want free software to be maintained and

00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:05,860
maintained well we need to find a way to

00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:07,360
fund its maintenance 18 years ago I

00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,579
guess Roman public an essay entitled

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,079
cathedral and the bazaar that essay

00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:12,790
catalyzed the start of the open source

00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:14,709
movement of a redefinition of free

00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,139
software to make it clear that openness

00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:19,120
not price was the important property we

00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,350
were aiming for what is him as well

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,149
remembered is that the cathedral and the

00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,680
bazaar wasn't the only essay that Roman

00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:25,269
wrote at the time he published two other

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,500
essays shortly after the cathedral on

00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:28,139
the bazaar one called homestead in the

00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,040
new sphere about the social organization

00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:32,259
motivations behind free software

00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,810
projects and the magic cauldron about

00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:35,949
the economics of free software one of

00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,029
the key distinctions that Roman

00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:39,129
highlights in that essay is the

00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:41,589
difference between u.s. value and sale

00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:43,389
value sale value of a product is its

00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:45,459
value as a saleable commodity literally

00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:47,410
what you can sell it for the use value

00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:49,449
of a product is its economic value as a

00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,920
tool as a productivity multiplier and

00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:54,069
this how much economic benefit the user

00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,269
will get from a product the important

00:09:54,069 --> 00:09:57,790
thing you've got to know is that the two

00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:59,319
aren't necessarily connected in a

00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,759
traditional manufacturing environment

00:09:59,319 --> 00:10:01,630
the focus is on sale value because

00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:03,370
that's ultimately linked to

00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,569
manufacturing cost the cost of parts of

00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,519
materials necessary to turn this thing

00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:08,949
off the production line but most

00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:11,589
software isn't produced for sale value

00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:13,899
its in-house software produced for use

00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:16,290
value and in the case of free software

00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:18,399
the sale value of free software is zero

00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,709
that doesn't mean though that the use

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,509
value is zero and the catch is working

00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:25,120
out how to exploit the use value that

00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:27,880
exists within an organization and using

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,949
that as the monetization channel okay so

00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,750
what are the options you have well it's

00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:34,060
not easy you can sell merchandise and

00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,230
this is really easy to do I throw a

00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,300
thing up on teespring you're selling

00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,860
t-shirts but let's be honest you're not

00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,100
going to fund your software empire by

00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,600
selling t-shirts ok you can get your

00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,839
users to pay for documentation write a

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,829
book get users to pay for it ok

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,269
unfortunately the dirty little secret of

00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:51,779
the tech writing scene is that nobody

00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:54,189
gets rich writing books thank you Andrew

00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:55,660
there are incredibly valuable resources

00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:57,490
for the community they're great for

00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:00,550
padding your resume but they're not so

00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:02,470
great as a revenue stream one area that

00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:04,000
does pay well is selling training

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,620
employers are willing to pay big bucks

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,389
for training courses if you can put

00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,900
together a three-day intensive workshop

00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:09,390
you can

00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,620
sell that again and again and again you

00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:13,630
can productize your offering

00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,910
source code remains free but it is a

00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:17,830
simple easy to use installer that costs

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,420
money and this works really well when

00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:22,570
what you have is a clearly identifiable

00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:24,340
product something like say an IDE one

00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,020
specific model of privatization is

00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,270
software as-a-service give the code away

00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,650
for free but pay for the convenience of

00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,660
someone else having it as someone else

00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:33,220
administer it for you any open source

00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,750
web project is it a good example of this

00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,790
you can install the software on your own

00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,530
servers yes but honestly unless you've

00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,060
got a reason to care use someone else's

00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:42,150
hosted solution give them money every

00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:44,950
month let them take care of it for you

00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:46,840
but software as a service is only really

00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,460
viable if you can deliver as a service

00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,260
which means it's really only viable for

00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,210
web now this this community that's not

00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,710
such a bad thing but as a board a

00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,000
software engineering thing not every

00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,470
software can be done every piece of

00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,780
software can be developed as software as

00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,460
a service and as technologies like

00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,020
docker commodified development it's

00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,880
possible that even this revenue stream

00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,990
might evaporate because the thing that's

00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,640
you Act the hard part the actual

00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,730
deployment might be able to be

00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,320
completely fact about ok so what else

00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,970
can you sell well you can sell access to

00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,950
the developers if you're the maintainer

00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,660
of a project you're in the best position

00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:18,280
to provide support or debug complex

00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,410
problems which means you're in the prime

00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,870
position to sell support and consulting

00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:25,920
honza carl calls this the ghostbusters

00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:28,420
business model who you're going to call

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,370
you can sell access to the software

00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,000
itself strangely trolltech did this with

00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,830
QT

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,710
riverbank still does with pi to keep a

00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:37,660
Qt bindings the library itself is GPL

00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:40,870
but if you want to use it on a closed

00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,250
source project you can for a fee now

00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,810
this has the advantage that it forces

00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,730
commercial interests to actually pay for

00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:47,800
what they're using but it also has a

00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,510
problem of discouraging smaller size

00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,460
scale commercial tinkering if I'm

00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:53,830
writing a new tool and I'm forced

00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:56,320
between open sourcing my tool or paying

00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:59,410
a thousand dollar price tag and I might

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,490
consider using a different option you

00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,140
can also get into the business of

00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,090
providing certifications and guarantees

00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,010
auditing code to ensure quality or

00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:07,870
compatibility providing guarantees about

00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:09,280
fixing bugs certifying that individuals

00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,290
are skilled in the use of your product

00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,970
this is a big part of red hats business

00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,830
model auditing packages making sure they

00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:16,450
all interoperate as expected ensuring

00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,250
that security updates are available meet

00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,380
the same standards certifying system

00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,880
administrators there is

00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,500
this is a set of products that appeals

00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,000
to the enterprise end of town and that's

00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,360
a really lucrative end of the market to

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,800
get into but those customers also tend

00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,300
to only want those guarantees for

00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,100
certain types of software broadly

00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,900
speaking boring fuddy-duddy software

00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,220
your operating system your database

00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,840
these are the pieces of software that

00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:41,410
must be rock-solid in an enterprise

00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,580
setting your debug toolbar maybe not so

00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,850
much unless it's being wrapped up in

00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,600
some other biggest suite of tools

00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,340
another problem with a lot of these

00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,560
revenue sources is that if you run your

00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:53,080
project well a lot of them are ruled out

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,030
or at least severely curtailed if you

00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,250
make something truly simple to use

00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:58,780
you've just removed the market for books

00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:01,090
and training courses or at the very

00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:03,070
least moved the ground to advanced

00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,600
courses in advanced books which are a

00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:07,210
lot harder to write and have a much

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,770
smaller audience django saw this

00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,360
firsthand Django's documentation was

00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:13,360
famously very good from a very early

00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,130
stage and as a result it was very hard

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,020
to get publishers to take on django book

00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:19,420
projects because the documentation was

00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:21,610
too good and was undermining the market

00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,870
for books it's taken a long time and a

00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,280
lot of self-publishing and some very

00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,440
dedicated individuals like Andrew

00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:29,680
sitting over here to get good Jango

00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,270
books available for sale if you have a

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,250
project mailing list where the community

00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:35,470
answers questions for free and it's a

00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,330
healthy responsive mailing list why

00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,920
would I pay for support and if your

00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:40,300
software is well designed and modular

00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,030
and those interfaces are well documented

00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:45,760
and I need a modification why wouldn't I

00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:47,110
just write them mod myself now okay I am

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,580
exaggerating there there are legitimate

00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,320
reasons to pay for support to bringing

00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,880
the consultant even if the interfaces

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,130
are clean and well documented but my

00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,170
point is the better you do your job is a

00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:57,460
free software engineer the harder it

00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:59,260
becomes to make the business case for

00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:01,000
your revenue stream because the value

00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:04,180
proposition becomes a lot less obvious

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,710
and if it isn't directly undermining

00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,390
your value proposition it can still

00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:09,370
undermine you indirectly because the

00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:11,230
more time you spent earning money the

00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:12,700
less time you spend paying he's been

00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:14,620
doing what the money is supposed to pay

00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:17,500
for administering a certification

00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,670
project a pro program takes time writing

00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,680
and development developing training

00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:22,450
courses takes time consulting can be

00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,520
lucrative but developing a sales

00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,960
pipeline takes time and if you're

00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,640
consulting you need to make sure that

00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,780
sales pipeline is full which means

00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,160
you're going to err on the side of

00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,900
taking more taking on more work than

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,440
less which means you've just closed the

00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,020
door on the time you have available to

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,220
on open source you also need to be

00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,840
careful that in selling your business

00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,940
case you don't undermine your main

00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,380
project if every hard question on your

00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,060
mailing list is answered with well we

00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,100
can answer that for a fee

00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:48,110
you're gonna start sounding like a shill

00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,610
and if your project says it needs money

00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:51,470
to make sure you stay stay on top of

00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:53,390
security issues you have to be really

00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:55,190
careful how you say that because the

00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,720
easy interpretation is well this process

00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:59,750
project must be insecure because they're

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,940
not on top of security now there's also

00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,200
a question of scale python django these

00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,700
are large projects with large

00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,250
communities making the business case for

00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:09,830
Python and Django isn't that hard it's

00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:11,420
not trivial but it's possible but as the

00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:13,070
maintainer of a smaller projects against

00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,720
a django debug toolbar are they

00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,610
seriously expected to write and sell a

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,410
book about Django debug toolbar to pay

00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:20,780
for its development or training and

00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,670
certification in its use those revenue

00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,680
streams don't really exist smaller

00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,240
projects have no are no less important

00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,040
to the vitality of the overall Django

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,180
ecosystem but those projects aren't

00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,330
afforded the opportunities for

00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:33,410
fundraising that larger projects have

00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:34,970
it's also important to realize that not

00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,230
all products are afforded these

00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,450
opportunities apply opportunities for

00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:41,240
revenue an IDE you can be productized a

00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:43,100
developer library probably not different

00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,730
projects need a different mix of revenue

00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:49,250
streams okay so when we do this without

00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:51,230
selling something at all free software

00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,700
stems from a moral imperative

00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:55,070
so can we fund development through all

00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,510
towards altruism and patronage well yes

00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:58,700
it's harder but there's evidence that it

00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:00,230
can be done one option it's seen a lot

00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,670
of activity recently is crowdfunding

00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,860
platforms like Kickstarter IndieGoGo

00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:05,660
provide a way for a group of people to

00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,400
pitch in and contribute to a goal

00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,689
Django community has got a couple of

00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,720
examples of really successful

00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:13,790
crowdfunding projects each raising tens

00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,230
of thousands of dollars but if you

00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,030
subvert survey the people who did these

00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:18,319
projects they didn't really make money

00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,079
on those projects the amount of

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,189
engineering time that went into them

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:25,250
really exceeded the amount of money they

00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:26,870
raised another idea that gets flooded

00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,120
regularly is the idea of bug bounties

00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:30,350
placing a price on specific bugs now

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,210
this is really just another form of

00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,980
crowdfunding you want a specific bug

00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,630
fixed to a feature added contribute

00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,310
money you really want to contribute some

00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,990
more and eventually someone will take

00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:40,970
the bait and fix that bug or implement

00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:43,040
that feature and it's an attractive

00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:46,610
model but it also has some really big

00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,830
problems most notably who gets paid do

00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,600
you

00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:50,039
hi bye lines of code written well that

00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,110
exert ignores the contribution of

00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:53,760
reviewers how much more important than

00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,169
writing code is reviewing code or

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,080
triaging a bug or writing the

00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:59,610
documentation but the biggest problem

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,720
that I see with crowdfunding approaches

00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,730
is that they're in conflict with

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,559
establishing a working income if you're

00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,909
hiring yourself out the shorter the

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,860
engagement the higher your hourly rate

00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:09,090
this is a hedge against unemployment at

00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,370
the edge of end of your contract if

00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:13,260
you're doing a Kickstarter you're best

00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:15,269
served by having a very small clearly

00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,970
described clearly achievable goal so a

00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:19,289
month or two of work if possible that

00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:21,029
means you need to charge your short-term

00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:22,919
rate in order to hedge against your long

00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:24,240
term income but it's also in your

00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:25,470
interest to have a low fundraising

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,840
target so that the campaign actually

00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:29,399
tips and seems achievable if it's too

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,500
high it can scare off potential bidders

00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:33,029
it also means that the community is

00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,950
paying a premium for the development of

00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:38,760
new features which isn't the best use of

00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:40,230
an already scarce resource okay so if

00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,880
you want longer-term income you need to

00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,960
start looking at longer-term engagements

00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,149
this means you have to stop looking at

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,799
funding specific projects and start

00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:48,389
looking at funding the person with

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,039
grants and fellowship positions I'm

00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:52,260
including patreon in this list because

00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:53,730
it's effectively crowd-sourced patronage

00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:56,059
you're not paying for a specific thing

00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:58,380
it's keep doing what you're doing money

00:18:56,059 --> 00:19:00,120
now over the last ten months Django has

00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,350
been using this model we hired a fellow

00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,179
at the end of last year and the fellows

00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:05,250
name is Tim Rome is responsible for

00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:07,860
keeping the project wheels greased from

00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,240
a tear from a technical perspective this

00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,799
has been a rolling success Tim's made

00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,269
great inroads into our ticket backlog in

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,980
the response times on ticket reviews are

00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:15,600
lower than they've ever been the hard

00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,000
part has been raising the money to pay

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,350
him we did a fundraiser at the start of

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,750
the year specifically to fund the fellow

00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:23,279
the campaign raised about $50,000 that's

00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,539
no small chunk of change but it's also

00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,070
not a lot when you're talking about a

00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:28,139
full-time employee we're going to need

00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:29,519
to do another fundraiser really soon if

00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:31,860
the felon fellowships going to continue

00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:33,149
almost everyone agrees it's been money

00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:35,130
well spent but converting that into

00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:37,139
donations has been hard work we're about

00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:38,429
to relaunch that fundraising campaign so

00:19:37,139 --> 00:19:39,419
that we can all contribute and hopefully

00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:41,039
be able to contribute well we will be

00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:42,899
able to contribute that on a continuing

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,340
month by month basis so that we can

00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:45,539
hopefully build an established income

00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,510
that we know we have every month to

00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:49,679
spend another approach to raising money

00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:51,240
is to embrace the devil and go

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,740
commercial commercial interests have the

00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,480
money so why shouldn't they pay for it

00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,010
and this can be very successful under

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,240
certain circumstances but you also have

00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:59,460
to make a business case for the

00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,020
corporate owner openstax a great example

00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,570
of this

00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,400
while Rackspace HP RedHat Ubuntu all

00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:05,930
inch did and OpenStack because they sell

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,760
products that benefit from commodifying

00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:09,290
a hosting environment by making it cheap

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,880
and easy to control cloud deployments

00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:12,350
they increase the size of the market for

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,740
cloud cloud hosting which means more

00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:17,240
money for them no js' is funded by giant

00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,310
for similar reasons giant as making a

00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,750
long play that it's easier to develop

00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:22,220
our web software more people will write

00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,320
web software increasing the market for

00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,970
joint services but node is also a

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,260
cautionary tale about caution corporate

00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,700
interests what happens when the

00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,990
community and the corporate sponsor

00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,910
disagree about the direction of a

00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:34,940
project well you get project splits like

00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:36,080
I ojs corporate money can corrupt you

00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,520
need to be careful the project

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,190
governance is independent of your

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,900
funding source having a single corporate

00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,280
master also puts the project at risk if

00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,110
that corporate master loses interest

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,520
Django is originally under the wing of

00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,350
the world company eventually that

00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:51,380
interest waned and the corporate support

00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,970
dried up to the other core / answer that

00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,020
gets floated to go get venture money and

00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:56,000
there are some great examples of people

00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,110
doing this meteor for example is funding

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,730
the development of their platform with

00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,690
money from a venture fund they've got

00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:02,030
plenty of money to hire engineers

00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:03,650
designers whatever they need what makes

00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,160
me nervous about this model we've been

00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:07,970
here before

00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:10,280
who here remembers ezel hey there we go

00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:12,200
okay so those who don't remember late

00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,670
90s ezel was a dot-com company that was

00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,980
funded to develop the Nautilus file

00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:17,870
manager for gnome and we got two years

00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,400
of great open source code and then the

00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:21,920
bubble burst and the company went bust

00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,390
because strangely enough no one wanted

00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,120
to buy a company that produced a far

00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:27,500
manager now the good thing is we still

00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,550
have the code but would be better to

00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,370
have that code still being actively

00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:32,840
developed and again this discussion is

00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:34,190
happening in an industry where billion

00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,770
dollar valuations are kicking around

00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:38,090
large parts of our industry are built on

00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,560
a foundation of free and open-source

00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:41,360
software but without those were the

00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:44,330
capacity to contribute in many cases

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,980
aren't contributing some are these are

00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:47,300
companies that do give huge amounts back

00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,770
to open source companies but there are a

00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,990
lot of companies that don't give back

00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:52,430
and even those that do give back many of

00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,840
them give to help they're able to give

00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:56,060
which isn't necessarily the help that is

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,560
needed the ACEF for example regularly

00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,330
receives offers for free and subsidized

00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,480
hosting from hosting providers and don't

00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:03,740
get me wrong it's great and most

00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,930
incredibly helpful and very very very

00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,490
very useful but what we really need is

00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:09,440
someone on the payroll - part of the

00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,820
review bugs earlier on the development

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,200
of one of Jango we needed people to

00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,760
review new features we're in a constant

00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,470
need for graphic designers at

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,060
artists and tech writers we need people

00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:19,250
who know how to do sysadmin we need

00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,590
community outreach and we don't need a

00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:24,620
thousand people donating one hour we

00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:27,440
need ten very specific people working 40

00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:29,150
hours a week when a disaster hits

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,740
organizations like the Red Cross call

00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:33,080
for donations and they will usually say

00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:35,540
please give us money not tins of food or

00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,250
blankets the reason money can buy what's

00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,810
needed you can't control what people

00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,670
donate and even if they do happen to

00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:42,680
donate exactly what is needed there is a

00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:44,420
huge logistic task of working out what's

00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,990
being donated and how to get it where

00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,030
it's needed

00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:48,830
free and open source projects are much

00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:50,150
the same they require resources some

00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:52,250
companies donate in kind and that's

00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:53,780
great but it's really exactly what is

00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,310
needed and it's very easy to get

00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,230
distracted working out what to do with

00:22:55,310 --> 00:23:00,230
what has been donated but you don't have

00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:01,520
an immediate useful and sadly just as

00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:03,020
with charities many companies just don't

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,040
donate at all and I'm not claiming these

00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,840
companies are being deliberately

00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,150
malicious in not funding open source if

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,160
anything we as a community have failed

00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:12,830
them because we haven't helped them help

00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:15,110
us most importantly we don't have a

00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:17,300
mechanism in place to make it easy to

00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:19,370
spend money and easy to receive money

00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,540
the current state of affairs clearly

00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:22,160
demonstrates that it's not enough that

00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,660
there is a lot of money in a community

00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,520
you have to make the mechanism for

00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:27,380
donating that money is obvious and

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,640
seamless as possible and you have to

00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,940
have someone to direct that money

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,830
towards one model community that I think

00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:36,050
does this really well is the WordPress

00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:38,690
community WordPress is GPL software

00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:40,130
there are books videos blogs on how to

00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:41,600
write WordPress plugins and themes the

00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:43,820
same as there is for every open source

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,550
community but critically there are also

00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:49,010
books videos and blogs about how to make

00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:51,800
a business writing WordPress plugins and

00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:53,690
themes WordPress is GPL and therefore so

00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,150
are all the plugins but they've got a

00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:58,370
store that you can go to to buy those

00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:59,720
plugins and get free ones and easily

00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,910
install them in your WordPress instance

00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,380
the WordPress ecosystem has

00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:05,210
fundamentally embraced the fact that

00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:07,940
money needs to be part of the equation

00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:10,610
and in by doing so they've created an

00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,680
industry that is self funding and this

00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:14,270
I'd argue is a big reason or one of the

00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,420
big reasons for the success of WordPress

00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:20,510
as a platform in that vein I'd like to

00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:23,210
make a very controversial proposal what

00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:24,800
if Popeye was a revenue stream what if

00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:26,390
when I registered an application and

00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,500
registered a project with Popeye I could

00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:29,750
specify a price

00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,580
either burn still burp or install

00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:34,040
perversion per app per month whatever

00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:36,200
and then when I pip install the cost

00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,730
just gets attached to my my pipe UI

00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,350
account and I get a monthly charge in my

00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:42,740
credit card that gets passed back to

00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:44,630
developer projects if pipe UI stats are

00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,460
B to believe Django is downloaded from

00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:49,760
pipe I more than a million times every

00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,990
month you put a 10 cent toll on each of

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,790
those downloads that would raise a

00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:55,820
hundred thousand dollars every month

00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:58,100
enough to pay for 10 full-time well-paid

00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,690
developers or a metric buttload of

00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,640
diversity outreach Django girls and

00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:03,080
community support you could also

00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,790
leverage the pipe i dependency

00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,170
information to pay it forward if you're

00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:07,460
writing a project that depends on

00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:09,350
another project you could opt to pass

00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,370
some of that revenue upstream or will

00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:12,170
request that people are people

00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:14,030
downstream projects provider time and

00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:16,550
then there's the biggest dependency of

00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:18,080
all type iin Python itself plays pipe I

00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,490
took a small cut of the revenue raise

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,020
that can help pay for the development

00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:23,990
and maintenance of pipe I and

00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:25,520
potentially Python itself you can also

00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,840
take some of that money collected put

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,980
into a development pool so if there's a

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,750
new project that needs some

00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,980
bootstrapping cash to get started or an

00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:33,020
established project that needs some help

00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,850
for a big task like our Python 3 upgrade

00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:37,940
the community as a whole can funnel

00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:39,410
money towards that project ok what about

00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,910
people who don't have money well you can

00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:42,590
offer still offer free passes you're at

00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:44,660
a Django a girl event use this promo

00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:46,460
code to have free access you can still

00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:48,920
give away your software at no cost and

00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,450
it's still free software you're still

00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,010
developing Python so you're still going

00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,690
to get the source you could probably

00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:56,180
even make the signup process completely

00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:58,100
optional all you're doing is paving the

00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:00,380
cow path making it easy to collect at

00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:03,440
all on the easiest possible way of using

00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:04,610
your software now I'm not going to say

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,960
that any of this is going to be easy to

00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:07,160
implement completely aside from any

00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,780
technical challenge and nailing down

00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,340
those details it's a bigger

00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:12,710
philosophical change for our community

00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:14,210
and that's the much bigger issue but the

00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:15,500
philosophical question about money is a

00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:18,680
discussion that we that we as a

00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:20,030
community need to have what we've got at

00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,530
the moment is a tragedy of the Commons

00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:23,210
everyone agrees that this software is

00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:25,130
good everyone knows the software needs

00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:26,960
to be maintained but why should one

00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:28,430
individual company take on the economic

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,510
burden of maintaining a funding

00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,980
maintenance of a product when their

00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:33,860
competitors are getting the benefits for

00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,270
free for me the key lesson from the

00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:37,190
music and movie industries from the last

00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:39,290
20 years is that if you make it simple

00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:41,059
and seamless for make it easy to do the

00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:43,309
right thing people will do the

00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:44,990
right thing if you make it simple and

00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:46,549
seamless for a large company to swipe

00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:47,779
their credit card get charged 100 bucks

00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:49,700
a month for using all this open source

00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:52,610
software they've been using using for

00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:54,350
free they will yes people are going to

00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:56,210
cheat don't worry about it as long as

00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:57,529
cheating isn't easier than doing the

00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:59,690
doing the right thing

00:26:57,529 --> 00:27:01,399
the biggest reason this isn't happening

00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:03,769
right now isn't that it is that it isn't

00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:05,509
obvious what the right thing is I could

00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:06,980
donate to the DSF or the PSF but it's

00:27:05,509 --> 00:27:08,570
fiddly to organize and it's not clear

00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:10,220
where the money goes and I could sign up

00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:11,990
to a few patreon or sign up a bug bounty

00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,950
program but not everybody's there and I

00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,149
don't really want that

00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:16,159
though the amount that's being given out

00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:17,499
is enough to fund a real living and I

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,299
don't just want to contribute beer money

00:27:17,499 --> 00:27:22,309
so what are we going to do short answer

00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:24,110
is I don't know there probably isn't

00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:25,429
going to be a silver bullet I'd like to

00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:27,710
think that monetizing a manifestation

00:27:25,429 --> 00:27:29,179
channel on pypy I would work but I'll be

00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:30,649
the first person to admit that that

00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:32,509
might not be the answer although there

00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:34,279
might be problems I haven't foreseen but

00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:36,830
I firmly believe this conversation is a

00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:38,749
conversation we have to have free

00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:40,909
software as a movement is over 30 years

00:27:38,749 --> 00:27:42,860
old open source is almost 20 we've

00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:45,110
conquered the technical hurdles we've

00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:46,610
even conquered the policy hurdles now

00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:48,889
it's time to tackle how we make this a

00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:50,210
long-term sustainable industry not just

00:27:48,889 --> 00:27:51,830
to commercials a set of commercial

00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:54,980
interests exploiting the naivety of a

00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:55,970
stream of doe-eyed volunteers now I'm

00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:58,249
actually gonna take a slightly more

00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:00,049
controversial position now and not take

00:27:58,249 --> 00:28:01,519
questions at this point for two reasons

00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:02,929
firstly because this sort of talk is a

00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:05,779
magnet for I have a comment on a

00:28:02,929 --> 00:28:07,429
question questions but also because this

00:28:05,779 --> 00:28:09,440
isn't a subject where I have the answers

00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:11,029
this is a discussion we need to have as

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,889
a community and I'm really eager to have

00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:15,830
that discussion just not on this stage

00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:17,600
we're about to break for for afternoon

00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:19,700
tea please come and see me I'm more than

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,039
happy to talk about this at length and

00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:24,019
as always getting me to stop talking at

00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:26,409
length is often the problem so thank you

00:28:24,019 --> 00:28:26,409
