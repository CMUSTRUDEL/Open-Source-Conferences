so today I'm going to talk about how to

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:33,960
tech has been changing in government

00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:36,719
okay so how often do you interact with

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,489
government when I say government I mean

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,430
your government it could be local it

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:46,200
could be state it could be federal in

00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:51,629
one year so for folks who do it twice a

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:55,079
year raise your hands okay got a couple

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:57,180

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:02,340
something with government okay you got a

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:15,900
couple couple more and no zero okay a

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:22,619
few Zhu do you guys file taxes so uh in

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:27,180
the pasta I'm missing my notes in the

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:29,520
past 12 months this is how this is on

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:33,090
average how many people have signed into

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:39,420
federal government websites I ask the

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:41,460
taxes question because most folks are

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:48,990
only interacting with government to do

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:51,689
their taxes however there are at the

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:56,659
time of the creation of the slide there

00:01:51,689 --> 00:02:00,960
were for the US federal government 160

00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:03,630
1495 people at one point on US

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:08,520
government websites with 1.4 billion

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:11,009
users for every 90 days there's three of

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,370
you in this room right now I'm just

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,370
kidding

00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:20,780
you can find this information on

00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:23,390
analytics at usa.gov and you can dig

00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,040
into where people are how people are

00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,860
using government websites on the federal

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,800
level so things are happening a lot of

00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,240
things are happening in on the state on

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,540

00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:05,120
to you today because I'm on a mission I

00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:07,250
get really really excited about this I'm

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,900
on a mission to get folks involved in

00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:12,080
public service and to understand this

00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:15,410
area better passionate public servants

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,660
are the cornerstone of government if you

00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,940
are not excited to be a part of helping

00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,070
out your government and the things that

00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:24,440
you can do by the end of this talk at

00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:27,680
least you will know two things one how

00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,180
Django is used in government and to some

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,530
of the resources that you can find

00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,390
coming out of government in the open

00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:36,920
source world so let's talk about

00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:38,600
government so Who am I so I've done a

00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,150
lot of stuff in the jenga and Python

00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,829
community but since I'm here in my

00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,930
official capacity today I will talk

00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:48,079
about my professional self a little bit

00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:50,239
more and I'm a former journalist that's

00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:52,010
how i came to django i worked at the

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,890
Washington Post where Adrian hollowbody

00:03:52,010 --> 00:04:02,959
worked and inherited some of his code

00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:05,540
when it was a pre one point O and and i

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,280
started in general ism because of the

00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:10,760
civic mission the idea of empowering

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,549
people and empowering citizens to be

00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,859
able to make decisions and currently i

00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:17,060
work at 18f which I'll talk about later

00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:19,250
which is a part of the federal

00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,650
government to me it's the same mission

00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:24,080
it's the ability to empower people to

00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:25,160
make good decisions and to be able to

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,100
offer them and get them the

00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,200
services that they need 18 f is just one

00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:34,700
part of the story but first of all who

00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:41,990
are you oh that doesn't seem to be

00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:45,050
showing up well okay well you can this

00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:52,580
is a map of jinguk on attendees oh there

00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:57,260
we go I did that on purpose the jenga

00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:59,440
Khan organizes where we're nice enough

00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:01,640
to let me use this from their invites

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,540
because I want to know who I was talking

00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:08,960
to and when my talk is mostly what's

00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,970
happening on the public sector in the US

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,440
federal government it's important to

00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:17,570
know that this movements happening all

00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:19,910
across the world every government entity

00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:22,400
has one thing in common how to best

00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:24,860
serve their people governments around

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,670
the world are exchanging on I exchanging

00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:31,100
ideas each sovereignty is also made of a

00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:33,980
unique set of beliefs to say that my

00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,720
cultural beliefs in in the US are

00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,960
different from other cultural beliefs in

00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,760
other countries and also regionally some

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,520
things translate from culture to culture

00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,830
while others do not varying views on

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,180
privacy for example and trust what do

00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,520
you trust your government to do what do

00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,440
you trust your government not to do

00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:54,919
varying structures of operation within

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,690
the government is is had an effect on

00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:59,570
the approaches that various governments

00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,580
and and entities have taken centralized

00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:05,780
government offices versus independent

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:07,580
and government offices so through the US

00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,830
example I hope you learn something today

00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:13,490
on the impact that you can make on your

00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:15,040
country on your municipality and to make

00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:21,050
the bet to make it a better place for

00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:23,540
the people who are like you in all even

00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,910
in the private sector we still have this

00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:30,470
mission how do we best serve the people

00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:32,030
the people being our customers and as I

00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:37,030
said this is happening all around the

00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:38,930
world if you go on government github.com

00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:43,160
forward slash community

00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:45,919
you can search to you can search a whole

00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,690
bunch of various entities on the local

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,180
state international level and you can

00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:52,280
see who's doing what you will see a huge

00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,770
amount of countries located

00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,330
internationally I can't talk about every

00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,460
one of them today so I will highlight

00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:00,650
one it's kind of considered the leader

00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:06,229
in the international realm which is gut

00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:08,330
you k mmm very launched in February 2012

00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:12,800
and there's sort of considered one of

00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:16,160
the the leading examples in government

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,810
digital services so I'm going to rewind

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,759
a little bit and start telling you

00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:23,139
what's happening on the federal side of

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:28,310
the u.s. so the library of congress and

00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:32,570
la brea congress is a was before the the

00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:34,250
launch of WK and specifically Jenga is

00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:37,780
used in the library congress's

00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:41,660
repository development center and

00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:45,139
including Jenga python solar bell rang

00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:47,150
Redis projects include one of them is

00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:49,820
called chronicling America which you can

00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:52,400
easily Google it's an old newspaper

00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:54,550
archive that's a project that I had

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,289
worked on after leaving journalism

00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:01,699
another project that uses Django is a

00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:03,979
deposit electronic deposit it is the

00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:07,490
electronic intake of content into the

00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:10,820
Library of Congress before this point in

00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:12,639
time people would literally walk up to

00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:15,530
the library Congress with hard drives or

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,150
mail in hard drives and still to this

00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,500
day some folks are doing that depending

00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,300
on the content depending on the size of

00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,300
the content but this was the foundation

00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:26,050
to allow people to follow electronically

00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,800
for a copyright and then get it

00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:32,690
classified in the library of congress

00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:35,300
and then next is the world digital

00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:38,060
library the way of digital library is

00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,260
housed in the library of congress some

00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,229
of you might know one of the major

00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,940
developers on this which is Chris Adams

00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:48,950
he's a longtime member of the python and

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:51,980
django community um and he seems to

00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:52,700
contribute under the radar to a lot of

00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,930
things but

00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:59,300
um I couldn't find one specific thing

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:01,640
that was like his his wheelhouse but

00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:04,940
he's um he's actually been a mentor of

00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:07,550
mine he's super awesome another one that

00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,620
has been a leader has been the Consumer

00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:12,230
Financial Protection Bureau if you've

00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:15,350
never heard of this you should know

00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:20,060
about it they're great they are they

00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:21,500
were created on july 21st 2011 as a

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,510
legislative response to the financial

00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,540
crisis of two thousand twelve two

00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:30,050
thousand sorry 2007-2008 and the

00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:32,510
subsequent great recession the consumer

00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:35,090
consumer they handle consumer protection

00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:36,830
in the financial sector it jurisdictions

00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:39,830
include banks credit unions security

00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:41,540
firms payday lenders motor service

00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:44,660
operations and foreclose relief debt

00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:46,340
collectors etc while the library

00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:50,090
Congress's repository Development Center

00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:51,710
existed before CFPB CFPB was an

00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,840
interesting use case because it was a

00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:55,670
greenfield project it was an agency

00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:59,330
where an agency didn't exist before

00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:01,160
which doesn't happen very often and so

00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:03,350
they were able to really push the far

00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:09,590
the bar forward on what's happening in

00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:12,700
government this is a great app its

00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:16,240
built-in Jenga and you can find it on

00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:18,500
CFPB's github repo owning a home API

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,600
basically you can look at unbiased

00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:24,440
interest rates for your geographical

00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:28,700
area I have to say while I was making

00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:31,520
these slides I went and I had some some

00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:34,340
links from CFPB and i went back and when

00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,870
i saw this i immediately sent it to like

00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:38,210
three friends who are trying to buy a

00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:40,640
house right now including my mom who's

00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:41,660
trying to refinance and I I thought it

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,700
was fabulous so it's not necessarily

00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:46,100
you're getting your interest rates from

00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,720
a private entity where you don't know

00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,900
what's happening in the background with

00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,340
respect to advertising dollars and so it

00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,430
can give you a good baseline for what

00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:58,910
your expectations should be another

00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:01,040
project is e regulations even ebags

00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:04,760
which for short ear eggs ear eggs make

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,430
this projects makes regulations easier

00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:10,149
to read and digest

00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:13,000
and easier to navigate the title matches

00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:14,980
the section the title matches the

00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,140
section of the URL updates as well so

00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:20,470
you can send direct URLs to a specific

00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:22,450
section of the regulation which as you

00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:23,529
can imagine as CFPB comes out and trying

00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,570
to regulate some of the financial

00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:28,959
markets or some of the things that are

00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:30,160
happening and protect consumers this is

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:35,440
a great way for people to share

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:38,290
information and so you can see well how

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,910
like the title updates honestly I this

00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:46,990
is eye candy I was really excited about

00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:50,110
the slide moving um yeah so uh president

00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:53,320
obama said we must harness new ideas and

00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:58,750
technology to remake government this was

00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:59,980
on january 21st 2013 as part of this he

00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,830
launched the presidential innovation

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:05,170
fellows which was where i went after the

00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:08,649
library of congress it was it was

00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:12,790
established in 2012 the photo above is

00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:13,839
the first round of fellows and the

00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:17,200
purpose of the presidential innovation

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,390
fellows is to bring innovation economy

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,310
into government this is the reference to

00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,050
some of the private sector stuff by

00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:25,480
pairing talented diverse technologists

00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,670
and innovators will top civil servants

00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,959
and change makers within the federal

00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:33,790
government to tackle some of our

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:35,020
nation's biggest challenges so some of

00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:39,250
the projects that have been worked on

00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:41,410
are the blue button initiative I was

00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:43,959
really excited when I saw this in the

00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:47,350
private like in like from my doctor you

00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:50,320
can now download your own health records

00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,910
and share them electronically that's

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,490
through the boot blue button initiative

00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:57,520
it increases accessibility to electronic

00:12:54,490 --> 00:13:00,070
health records the greenback green

00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,020
button connect reduces waste and shrinks

00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:05,410
bills by providing consumers information

00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:09,160
on how their power what the power usage

00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:11,850
is and where it's coming from not alone

00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:14,770
dev is actually a very interesting case

00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:16,420
not alone job was a white house

00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:19,040
initiative built in less than 30 days

00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,589
and it was to improve the trans

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,149
perrin see and information sharing of

00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:25,399
sexual assault prevention and

00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:27,889
enforcement data for schools for

00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:32,810
students in schools and as you will know

00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:37,399
I skipped over goq because that was my

00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:39,319
project and so during my fellowship I

00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:41,389
worked on a project called goq which is

00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:43,819
an open-source disaster well it's an

00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:46,490
open-source mapping tool where you can

00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:47,959
do mapping workflows but as a it was

00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,610
used in this context and created in this

00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:52,389
context for disaster response and

00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:55,610
recovery it crowdsources geotag photos

00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:57,889
to coordinate response the original idea

00:13:55,610 --> 00:14:02,029
came to increase the speed of damage

00:13:57,889 --> 00:14:04,790
assessments when Hurricane sandy hit it

00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:05,899
took it takes a multiple effort from

00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:08,180
multiple folks in multiple jurisdictions

00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:11,060
to be able to assess the amount of

00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,769
damage on a house at the same time

00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,930
people are sleeping on cots and don't

00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:17,449
have a home but they needed people to

00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:20,029
physically go to the house using imagery

00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:22,519
from public from social media and using

00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:26,750
imagery from the Civil Air Patrol who

00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:31,579
does flyovers after a disaster we could

00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:33,560
start to start to identify properties

00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:35,420
that were in such decrepid condition

00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,579
that we can then issue money to be able

00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:42,860
to get people on their feet faster and

00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:44,449
back to their life this project also led

00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,660
the national geospatial-intelligence

00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:49,130
agency to join github which is really

00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:52,459
exciting because it paved the way for

00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:58,069
intelligent community entities to be

00:14:52,459 --> 00:15:00,589
able to post repost publicly so this

00:14:58,069 --> 00:15:03,110
this is really exciting to me the

00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:04,880
changing landscape we the landscape is

00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,550
say the changing landscape is saving

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,649
lives and saving money and Django is

00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:14,810
beyond behind a lot of the work that's

00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:17,959
happening on august seventeenth 2015

00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:19,610
which was just a couple days ago the

00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:22,009
President signed an executive order

00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:24,560
which made the presidential innovation

00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:28,310
fellows a permanent entity within the

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:31,100
government now 18 f which is where I

00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:32,529
work 18f came after the presidential

00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:38,690
innovation fellows

00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:40,820
18f was launched on March 14th 2014 it's

00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,949
a digital consultancy for the US

00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:45,410
government inside the US government what

00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:48,230
does that mean where we are a sub

00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:50,510
component of an agency called the

00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:53,600
general service administration and as

00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:56,360
such we do we work with other agencies

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,079
and help empower them with digital

00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:02,240
services currently we're working with a

00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:05,209
more than a dozen dozen agencies to help

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:08,380
them deliver on their missions in user

00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:13,279
center agile open and a data-driven way

00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:16,639
we we ship code practices and culture so

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:20,209
code we are open by default you can find

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,790
all of our code here and there are so

00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:24,440
many repos that it's hard to find repose

00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,769
so if you are looking for something

00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:30,860
specific please let me know or I will

00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:33,019
answer the question afterwards but one

00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,449
of the great things about being opened

00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:37,130
by default basically you can see I'm

00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:39,740
working on a project if you were to go

00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:42,610
to my github history I publish it a

00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:48,949
couple days ago and it's a really dirty

00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:51,019
prototype for a date API using Jenga see

00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:52,519
yeah you can it's not the people aren't

00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:54,260
we're not scared about sort of throwing

00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:55,819
things out there if anything is not

00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,889
public there needs to be a reason why

00:16:55,819 --> 00:17:02,569
and then it's published that it's

00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:04,370
specifically not public so one of the

00:17:02,569 --> 00:17:08,630
one of the coolest projects in my

00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:10,669
opinions open FEC FEC data was hard to

00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:13,640
fec is the Federal Election Commission

00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:17,959
and they handle federal financial data

00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:19,640
for elections and it had in this API

00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:21,770
allows the American people to better

00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,540
understand what's going on with

00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:26,150
elections and how they work by browsing

00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:29,270
reports document data individual

00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:32,270
donations who's donating to whom granule

00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:35,660
spending data it was launched actually

00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:39,799
in July 2015 it was not built in Django

00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:41,840
but it was built in flask so who here

00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:45,950
has a fourth grader I'm really excited

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,500
about this fourth graders yes oh but you

00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,670
don't live in the

00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:55,880
that's to you oh oh that's kind of I'm

00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:55,880
sorry i was excited about it until that

00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:05,040
well every Kim the park was launched in

00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:07,670
September 2015 this was built in Jenga

00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:10,050
so just launched it was really exciting

00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:12,480
every Kim the park gives us fourth

00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:15,300
graders free access to all federal lands

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,780
and water including national parks

00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:21,860
forests wildlife refuge refuge refuges

00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:24,360
and marine sanctuaries for a full year

00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:27,990
families and friends can go for free as

00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:31,650
well so I need to find a fourth grader

00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:37,740
if if you have a fourth grader if we can

00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:41,520
talk afterwards so at every kid in a

00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:44,730
park grove um these are some students

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,220
from Samuel Samuel W Tucker elementary

00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:51,420
school which received every kid in a

00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:53,850
park pass and as I said it was built in

00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:56,010
Jenga one interesting thing about this

00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:58,410
project was the special thought to be

00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:00,630
put into the audience the audience being

00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:03,060
fourth graders so the text was written

00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,620
for fourth graders fourth graders are

00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,210
too young to be on facebook so things

00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,370
like linking off to Facebook wasn't an

00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,740
option it was really vetted and

00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:12,480
thoughtfully made to make sure that it

00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:18,450
was awed Ian supriya to get kids

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:21,480
involved in the national parks so said

00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:25,410
code here's practices some examples of

00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,760
practices are our 18f guides the link

00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:31,740
was a little bit long so i created a

00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:35,870
bitly link bit ly 18 f guides including

00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:38,790
there you can find various guides on

00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:42,480
those topics the one I'm most excited

00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:46,080
about is accessibility I we have the

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,270
sort of working groups and I was one of

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,280
the members of the accessibility working

00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:53,850
group the idea making websites

00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:56,280
accessible to everyone analytics agile

00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:57,929
practices ap is some of them you might

00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,680
not need but there are some great

00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:02,140
resources in there that you

00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:04,440
can refer to automatic testing plate

00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:08,020
cookbook automated testing playbook

00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:10,500
content design methods fun end group

00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,550
'let's which is how we sort of spit up a

00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,440
group list which is sort of how do we

00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:15,820
spin up sort of working groups to get

00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,060
things like this done which aren't

00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:21,780
direct projects like every kitna park

00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:25,270
and then how we handle open source and

00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:27,520
if you would like to make suggestions or

00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:29,770
updates you can with a pull request or

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:35,200
submit a ticket and we can address that

00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:40,180
for you so um practices teaching agile

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:44,620
using Legos this is really exciting if I

00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:46,390
haven't said that enough so well the

00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,670
guides are open-ended we also do formal

00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:51,250
teachings as part of the work we do for

00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:52,750
example 18f consultant Zach Cohen later

00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,700
workshop to teach the importance of

00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:57,250
agile methodologies to folks who weren't

00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:00,220
used to practicing agile methodologies

00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:02,530
the story he gave to folks was as an

00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,810
office worker I want a laptop stand so I

00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:09,040
have more desk space and the task was to

00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:12,490
build a laptop stand out of Legos it

00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:14,470
teaches it taught these people to

00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:17,110
communicate early communicate often and

00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:19,810
communicate continuously so you have a

00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:24,820
laptop stand that's built as opposed to

00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:26,350
a whole desk culture another because

00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:30,550
it's hard to the links a little bit long

00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:35,680
i made a bit late link 18f COC for code

00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:40,480
of conduct example and this is a very

00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:42,970
exciting it would the color coded we

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,410
actually have a code of conduct for my

00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,030
knowledge this is the first code of

00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:47,650
conduct not just legal requirements but

00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:50,020
first code of conduct within the federal

00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:53,320
government it was inspired by 10

00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:56,380
different multiple code of conduct and

00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:59,080
legal requirements from bridge foundry

00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:03,130
open hatch the Python community PI

00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:05,020
ladies 8 initiative and more if you have

00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:08,140
any opinions or suggestions please feel

00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:12,190
free to submit we want people to

00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:14,340
participate and last but not least the

00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:17,440
United States digital services

00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:21,570
it was founded a little bit after 18 f

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:24,940
uh it was founded on august eleventh

00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:27,190
2014 and it is a part of the White House

00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:30,040
White House's Office of Management and

00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:31,900
Budget the mission is to improve and

00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,580
simplify digital experience that people

00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:38,320
and businesses have with their

00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:39,400
government so one of the one of the

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,990
things that they're working on is

00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:45,160
improving services for Americans

00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:48,850
veterans usds stood up a team at the VA

00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:53,530
and to create a simple and easy to

00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:56,370
navigate VA website also to improve the

00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:58,960
benefits claims experience for veterans

00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:01,360
usds is working towards a more efficient

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,630
and effective via that delivers for

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,970
America's veterans and as some of you

00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:09,430
some of you might know Alex Gaynor he

00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:12,880
was recruited for this effort so Alex

00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:13,960
Gaynor is now living in DC he moved and

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,600
is working at the Veterans

00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:20,050
Administration and interestingly enough

00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:22,510
I didn't know this when he was hired and

00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:25,540
we had a meet and greet for the new team

00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:29,470
at the Veterans Administration and root

00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:32,470
beer floats and I turn around and Alex

00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:34,570
Gaynor is standing there and I was like

00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:36,820
what are you doing here you're you live

00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:39,760
in DC now and he goes hi I'm part of the

00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:43,660
new team so that's how I found alex was

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:45,870
and Alex was in DC and I'm I'm really

00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:48,460
excited that he joined the government

00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:51,580
another thing that has been created is

00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:57,250
the USD s playbook which is found at

00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:59,440
playbook CIO gov this creates a set of

00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:02,470
plays for CIOs more on the business side

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,450
to be able to understand things that

00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:07,660
need to happen in a very high level way

00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:09,700
things like default by open understand

00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:11,350
what the people need understand the

00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:15,010
whole experience from start to finish

00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:16,930
make things simple and intuitive build

00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:21,550
the service using agile and iterative

00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:24,000
practices bring in bring in experienced

00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:27,049
teams choose a modern technology stack

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,019
deploying a flexible hosting environment

00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:31,850
automate testing and deployments manage

00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:34,340
security and privacy through reusable

00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:36,559
processes use data to drive decisions a

00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,360
lot of these are things that we take

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,700
that some of us might take for granted

00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,860
as yeah of course these are things that

00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:47,960
you're supposed to do but this sort of

00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:51,080
gives these these give CIOs in

00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:54,379
government a guiding force by which to

00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:58,539
make decisions that follow modern modern

00:24:54,379 --> 00:25:01,399
technology stacks and methodologies and

00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:05,359
sometimes it takes a village this is

00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:08,919
really exciting and this was a

00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:11,749
partnership between 18f and you SDS and

00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:16,389
what I'm going to get all government now

00:25:11,749 --> 00:25:19,009
well it has OMB memorandum m 15 13 a

00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:22,039
policy to require secure connections

00:25:19,009 --> 00:25:26,169
across federal websites and web services

00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:29,570
was signed in jun 2015 what is that

00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:31,909
recreating making HTTP only standard in

00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:34,970
the federal government and pushing

00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:38,980
making sure all federal agencies move in

00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:42,649
that way why is this exciting because

00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:45,499
people like you helped make this

00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:48,169
possible and to create this policy to

00:25:45,499 --> 00:25:52,759
say that that this should be a thing

00:25:48,169 --> 00:25:54,080
that we do and so therefore making the

00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:59,690
recommendations to make an official

00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:05,690
thing with policymakers and so this

00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:10,600
image is an image of the HTF team in a

00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:10,600
very accurate map of the United States

00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:21,830
we ran out of room ah so we talked about

00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:25,730
18 f and usds the VA cfpb our folks in a

00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:30,499
lot of these agencies remote teams

00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:31,730
spread across the country folks folks

00:26:30,499 --> 00:26:34,879
who've joined us from the Python

00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:38,749
community include Christine LA from LA

00:26:34,879 --> 00:26:40,730
one of the founders of Pi ladies Kathlyn

00:26:38,749 --> 00:26:45,380
Devlin from Dayton who Ron

00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:47,660
hi Ohio and Julia elman in Raleigh which

00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:52,640
is very close to austin in our very

00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:55,549
accurate map known for par ladies and

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,960
girl develop it and then of course a

00:26:55,549 --> 00:27:01,010
couple of the presidential innovation

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:04,700
fellows have joined also folks active in

00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:06,500
non Python communities such as Sarah

00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:09,799
Allen who's the founder of railsbridge

00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:11,570
she's located in San Francisco and we

00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:14,600
come from a folks who've joined come

00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:19,730
from a wide variety of backgrounds this

00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:22,419
is a image of the backgrounds from the

00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:27,740
2014 presidential innovation fellows

00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:30,130
when this is a heading of folks from a

00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:32,929
wide variety of backgrounds as important

00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:36,740
we talk about diversity and diversity at

00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:40,400
work in in many different ways and why

00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:43,910
why is this important because we are

00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:47,059
representing a large constituency of

00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:50,110
folks for the people by the people this

00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:53,750
applies to everyone in every sector

00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:57,110
whatever people you are serving you

00:27:53,750 --> 00:28:00,860
cannot truly advocate for the users of

00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:03,740
your systems that you create if you do

00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:10,299
not represent the users our audience is

00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:15,320
America and everyone in America now um

00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:19,340
last night uh I don't know one a.m. or

00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:24,320

00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:51,940
iPhone and he is a technical advisor to

00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:53,900
the White House and the former second

the securities receive are going to

00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:26,750
improve disaster recovery and much much

00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:29,000
much more it's moving paragon amazing

00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:31,340
people like Jack deeply get the

00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,800
developers designers data science park

00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:38,060
managers tremendous seals and hearts the

00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:40,820
size and so that means you if you're

00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:43,100
skilled color inside of Geonosis please

consider certain airhead you want to

00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:48,260
growing number of avenues introduced as

00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:51,590
a present condition code or like a tour

00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:55,310
of duty as a member of ATM or the US

00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:56,690
industries our country easy together we

00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:59,060
the people people who have a better

00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:02,710
level in our people thanks so much for

00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:02,710
consideration and take the best care

00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:13,860
so yeah so I told you a lot about the

00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:16,379
work that's been happening I told you

00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:18,059
you can find what that's happening

00:30:16,379 --> 00:30:22,049
outside the US I like I said there's a

00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:23,429
lot of coordination between there's a

00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:26,789
lot of coordination between various

00:30:23,429 --> 00:30:29,330
countries we've I've personally chatted

00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:31,889
with folks who work on the UK side

00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:33,690
there's folks in Indonesia there's folks

00:30:31,889 --> 00:30:36,299
in Australia that we've coordinated with

00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:38,429
and but it's not just at the federal

00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:42,240
level it's also the local level your

00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:44,820
local community and empowering the local

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,379
citizens to be able to make decisions so

00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:49,289
if you're interested more in local stuff

00:30:46,379 --> 00:30:52,470
I encourage you to go back to the pike

00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:54,149
on talk by Kathryn Bracy to learn a

00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:58,980
little bit more about efforts like code

00:30:54,149 --> 00:31:00,419
for america um but but yeah there's

00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:04,139
there's a lot a bit work to do on all

00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:07,740
levels so I hope that I hope that after

00:31:04,139 --> 00:31:10,529
you leave today you will start to get

00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:14,309
involved if not obviously not everyone

00:31:10,529 --> 00:31:16,980
can just pick up and leave their job at

00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:20,820
least not as a side effort because we

00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:23,820
need we need help we need lots and lots

00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:26,159
of help there's lots of work to do there

00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:28,970
are over there were about a hundred

00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:32,610
federal agencies and I just told you

00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:33,720
about a handful this is not to say there

00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:38,759
aren't efforts happening at other

00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:40,860
agencies but this is this is not to say

00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:42,629
that there aren't a junt efforts

00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:44,669
happening at other agencies but there's

00:31:42,629 --> 00:31:46,830
just a lot of work in every corner and

00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:48,240
whatever your interest is in the local

00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:51,149
or federal government please come and

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,559
talk to me and I will tell you about

00:31:51,149 --> 00:31:53,850
various opportunities whether you're

00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:57,419
interested in financial whether you're

00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:59,940
interested in data for example census

00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:03,110
whether you're interested in you know

00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:06,480
helping veterans or cultural

00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:10,759
institutions either in your country or

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,759
in ours thank you

00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:23,529
Thank You Jackie for an excellent talk

00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:25,360
we do have time for questions I'm going

00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:27,249
to kick off of one myself there's

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,200
clearly lots of things that 18f could be

00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:30,669
involved with do you reach out agencies

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,549
or do you wait for them to come to you

00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:35,409
for help yes um so its Afton a

00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:37,840
combination we have something called a

00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:39,070
project intake meeting where we discuss

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:43,360
sort of some of the emails that have

00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:45,450
come in and we review them 18f is run

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,860
off of agreements with other agencies

00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:50,619
which are called interagency agreements

00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:53,080
and within those agreements we write in

00:32:50,619 --> 00:32:55,450
stuff like a jali right in stuff like

00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:57,970
open source by default and have a 30-day

00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:59,830
exit clause so if the relationship

00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:01,749
doesn't work out we have a way to

00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:03,460
exercise it but we've never we've never

00:33:01,749 --> 00:33:05,350
had a situation where we had to exercise

00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:11,980
that we've always been sort of able to

00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:15,100
get through things together hi seeing

00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:17,590
your goq project was hurling to me I

00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:20,259
just like to say that I'm from New York

00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:23,350
and seeing a lot of the tech community's

00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:25,149
response to sandy was pretty vapid let's

00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:27,190
hack the storm and a lot of things came

00:33:25,149 --> 00:33:30,490
out of that didn't end up helping people

00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:33,340
so it was a real thrill to see what you

00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:36,730
did and thank you for that my question

00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:39,580
is how did you do qualitative analysis

00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:41,320
on the photos so to say these photos

00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:45,519
were taking and so there's more damage

00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:47,110
here than there is over here sure um so

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:52,090
while I was working on that project

00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:53,950
specifically we hadn't got up to that

00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:55,779
point in the process so I can't really

00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:57,850
speak to it however if you want to see

00:33:55,779 --> 00:33:59,860
me afterwards I can provide your contact

00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:03,190
information to the folks that are

00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:05,289
currently working on it or you can file

00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:08,020
a github ticket in their repo since it's

00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:10,299
open and I can point you to that and

00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:13,379
they can they can answer your question

00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:13,379
okay thank you

00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:28,400
hi Jackie I'm Carol you knew that um

00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:31,429
we're the corner where Cara was in San

00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:34,190
Diego just at the very bottom and I'm

00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:37,250
wondering you know I found out about the

00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:41,060
18 f guides from Julia back in February

00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:43,340
and they are outstanding I highly highly

00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:46,940
recommend everybody take a look at it

00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:49,100
I'm kind of thinking off the cuff at the

00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:51,650
moment but you know now that we have pie

00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:55,390
ladies remote maybe it would be nice to

00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:58,340
do a series on the guides that relate

00:34:55,390 --> 00:35:03,350
like a specific guide like accessibility

00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:05,180
with you know a topic on actual

00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:07,340
development like like anchor

00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:10,640
asynchronous teams and remote work yeah

00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:12,470
well specific oh yeah or like San Diego

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,800
we have a lot of veterans that come back

00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:18,170
and we have at the Fab Lab grants for

00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:22,670
re-entry I wonder if there's a way

00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:26,780
beyond just code for america to engage

00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:28,930
people within those communities that the

00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:32,770
project serve to actually contribute

00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:35,870
sure i think i mean i think the the i

00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:39,290
think the closest thing I have seen to

00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:41,150
that is the local offices of Code for

00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:45,770
America which is like code for DC code

00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:49,880
for I I'm sure there's a code for San

00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:52,100
Francisco brain code for Los Angeles and

00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:55,250
then internationally code for all okay

00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:57,560
and when you go to those so Code for

00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:58,850
America itself has a like the the

00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,650
fellowship program it's a more

00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:04,280
structured program when you go to the

00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:05,630
local ones you walk in and you say i'm

00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,810
going to work on this project who wants

00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:10,250
to help me right and you can use you can

00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:11,900
sort of use that as your umbrella to

00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:13,520
like reach out to people so is that the

00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:17,090
same or different than Code for America

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:19,520
um I believe it's under the umbrella of

00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:21,620
Code for America okay for example like a

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,900
Code for America has a summit every year

00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:27,680
and all the brigade captains from the

00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:30,110
city from the city's go to go to the

00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,660
summit as like default so they're like

00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:33,999
it's like one big happy family got it

00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,829
thank you yeah

00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:39,239
no problem so for no more questions

00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:39,239
