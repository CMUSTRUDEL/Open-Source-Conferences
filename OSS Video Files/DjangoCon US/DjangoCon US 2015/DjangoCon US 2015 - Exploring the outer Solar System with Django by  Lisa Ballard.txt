Description: 
	Exploring the outer Solar System with Django

I'm a web developer at the Planetary Rings Node, part of the NASA Planetary Data System. Our tiny shop is devoted to archiving, cataloging, and distributing scientific data sets relevant to planetary ring systems. Our base of operations is the SETI Institute, where a research community is busy searching for and studying life in the universe.

At the Rings Node I develop and maintain an outer planets space mission data search tool called OPUS which is built with Django. It lets users search data, browse images, and access its API via http. I'll talk about some of the reasons for OPUS, some of the challenges we faced in building it out and porting it - from a hot mess of php - to what it is today, and I'll talk a little about our plans for the future.

And we'll see some pretty pictures of the outer planets. :-D

thank you thank you for coming to my

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,420
talk I work on a project called opus

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:30,840
it's a search interface that for that

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,329
people use to find data and images from

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,750
NASA space probe missions to the outer

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:38,579
solar system it's built on Jango and I'm

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,680
going to talk a little bit about why we

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,860
built it and some of the ways people are

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,079
using it and I'll demo it as well so I

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,530
work at SETI Institute in Mountain View

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,079
California a study stands for search for

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,629
extraterrestrial intelligence and it

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,690
started in nineteen eighty-four as a

00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:00,210
nasa project to use radio observatories

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,059
to listen for signals from other star

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:06,000
systems that might indicate signs of

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:10,049
intelligent life and so today 30 years

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,320
later study runs its own up it runs its

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:15,659
own radio observatory and the SETI

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,990
project is still going strong but it's

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:21,570
also a larger research center where it's

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,520
the base of operations for over 60

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,850
scientists and their students and staff

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,329
who study many areas of planetary

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:33,030
science such as planetary geology

00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:35,880
asteroid research planetary dynamics

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,759
exoplanets so basically anything related

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,540
to the study of life and habitability in

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:45,720
the universe so a group at SETI is a

00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,149
nasa-funded data archive and our

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,509
scientific leadership are experts in

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:53,399
planetary ring moon systems so many

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:56,219
people are aware that saturn has these

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,159
epic beautiful rings but a lot of people

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:01,619
don't realize that Jupiter Neptune and

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,110
Uranus actually have rails as well and

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:07,710
these are some pictures of them and so

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:10,080
we at the Rings node archive data from

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:13,250
missions to these planets and we support

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,250
researchers in this field

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:19,650
we built opus in fine NASA tradition we

00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:23,689
gave it an acronym opus stands for outer

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:28,799
planets unified search and idea is that

00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:31,620
when you've I'm sorry when you've we

00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:34,859
brought seven missions into one civil

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,629
interface so like we've unified them so

00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:39,870
I'll jump right into demoing it for you

00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:41,370
so this is the landing page and

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,260
ironically let's sort of my least

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,060
favorite page of the interface because

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,599
it's just a little bit complicated when

00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:51,180
we first land on it we serve primarily

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:54,870
the scientific research community and it

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,730
has a lot of features and options and it

00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,620
has a lot of specialized features so it

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,760
can be rather complicated my sort of bad

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:05,040
joke is that it looks like a DMV form

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,980
but the idea is this you start with a

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,859
lot of results that you can access our

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,200
entire entire database so that blue bar

00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:15,569
at the top there's a number if you can

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,060
see that that's telling you that there

00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:20,879
are 1.2 million results that you can

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,159
access right now and that is a count of

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:27,120
everything in the database so for this

00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:29,609
tool we archive the complete set of

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,150
remote sensing observations for several

00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:35,609
NASA missions both Voyager probes

00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:38,519
Cassini Galileo new horizons and there's

00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:40,109
some Hubble data in here as well and so

00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:44,940
the idea is that you want to narrow down

00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:46,319
your results can't to find the data that

00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,090
you're looking for or what you want to

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,239
learn about and the interface gives you

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:54,870
feedback as you sort of drill down into

00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:57,479
the data and on the left side there's

00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,549
this monster list of parameters and if

00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,229
you click one of those it brings in a

00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:03,750
search widget there are now two search

00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:05,879
widgets showing by default in the center

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,909
so to bring in a search widget based on

00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:11,069
any number of parameters and you can use

00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:13,109
those to constrain your search so so

00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:16,440
i'll show you what i mean i'll go ahead

00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:19,229
and click Jupiter and the first thing

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,049
you might notice is that a list opens

00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:24,630
below where i clicked so that is

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:26,370
actually a list of Jupiter's moons so

00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,180
when you click one of the planets you

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,690
get

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:33,750
a list of its targets or its moons or

00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:36,120
really features will open and it lets

00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,770
you sort of drill down further and the

00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,690
other thing that happened is that the

00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,759
number in the top got a lot smaller

00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:45,780
because you're basically saying show me

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,820
only results tagged Jupiter and so

00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:51,270
clicking browse results to see what we

00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:55,080
get and you get this gallery of space

00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:58,080
images that is forever infinite

00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:01,889
scrolling so the default ordering of

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:05,220
this interface is ascending time so what

00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:07,199
we're actually seeing here is are the

00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,259
earliest observations in our database

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,530
and this is Voyager 1 as it first opens

00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:16,289
its camera shutter and images the planet

00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:18,479
Voyager on its approach to Voyager so

00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:20,789
the Voyager mission is actually two

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,770
spacecraft they're identical they were

00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:25,590
launched a few months apart in the late

00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:27,960
70s and they both had an original

00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:30,150
mission of just going to Jupiter and

00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,360
Saturn but they've both extended their

00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:35,490
mission far beyond that jubert a Voyager

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,039
2 has actually gone on to Uranus and

00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:40,320
Neptune and Voyager 1 the spacecraft

00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:42,330
that took these images has actually left

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,479
the solar system becoming humanity's

00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:47,760
first interstellar probe so you can

00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:49,800
definitely infinitely scroll here but

00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,780
you can also jump to page it so there's

00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,260
a little input at the top and I jumped

00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:58,770
here about 125 pages forward and also

00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:01,620
forward in time so now Voyager 1 is much

00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:04,050
closer to Jupiter and it's taking these

00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:07,080
close-up images of Jupiter's atmosphere

00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:10,949
and the very strange textures of its

00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:13,740
storms and its turbulent atmosphere so I

00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:16,320
should say a little bit about these

00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,090
these galleries thumbnails because the

00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,590
if you can pick up the color here

00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:23,520
they're actually green and purple and

00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:25,530
and blue so space imaging cameras are

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,479
actually black and white cameras most

00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:30,000
often you can collect a lot more

00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:33,509
information at every pixel with a black

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,580
and white camera and so each of these

00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:37,740
cameras has color filters that they use

00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,510
they have filter wheels so they can drop

00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,440
in a filter in front of the camera and

00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,120
that way they pick

00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,550
up light at different wavelengths or

00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,950
different colors but when we get the

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,510
images back on the ground without any

00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:51,060
special processing there are actually

00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:52,830
grayscale or black-and-white images so

00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:56,460
for this gallery we actually added a

00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:59,070
false-color tinting just as an indicator

00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,260
to the user of what filter was used in

00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:03,330
that observation as a quick way to see

00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:05,940
it and I'll tell you a little bit later

00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:08,670
about why that's helpful so this is a

00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:11,130
different search I've done nothing but

00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:13,560
clicks a turn instead of Jupiter and I

00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,940
skip to page seven hundred just to get

00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,160
forward in time a little bit here and

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,260
another and the thing you might notice

00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,360
is that the number is much larger that

00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:24,360
that the result count is much larger

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,710
than it was for Jupiter and that's

00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,330
because most of the images in our

00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:30,240
database are actually of Saturn and

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:32,310
that's because of the Cassini mission so

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,650
the casino mission the Cassini

00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,780
spacecraft launched 20 years after the

00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,670
voyagers left Earth and unlike the

00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,100
voyagers which are flyby missions

00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:43,470
Cassini is actually an orbiter so it

00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:46,440
went into orbit around Saturn and today

00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:49,260
it's completed over 220 orbits and it is

00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:52,230
these crazy orbits so this is a diagram

00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,970
of the orbital path of Cassini and you

00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:56,910
can see it swings way close to the

00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:58,919
planet and way far out and what it's

00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,750
doing is it's trying to image the ring

00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:05,070
system because it's a very vast system

00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:06,960
and also saturn has over 60 moons and so

00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:08,490
they plan these orbits to fly very close

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,160
to some of the moans and get close-up

00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,380
images of moons and then come in very

00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,570
close to the planet to get images of the

00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:18,540
atmosphere and close-up views of the

00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:21,780
Rings so one thing I love about Cassini

00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:24,720
in terms of this interface is it's a

00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:27,720
very stable platform for imaging cameras

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,760
so when Kathie Lee focuses on a thing

00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,370
it's very good at keeping that thing in

00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,520
the center of the frame and so as you

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:37,169
browse Cassini images you can see that

00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:41,010
many of them kind of look like frames of

00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:43,020
a movie and so so this is a sequence

00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:45,330
where Cassini is looking at the tiny

00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,100
moon Atlas in the center there and if

00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,600
you in this interface you can click and

00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,710
see a larger image and if you kind of

00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,660
just if you have a good internet

00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,579
connection and you hold down the right

00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,430
oki you can kind of get this like frame

00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:58,259
animation movie effect and there's many

00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:01,529
many frames like this where there's just

00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:03,300
interesting movie sequences that that

00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:05,279
you can check out and people are using

00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,779
this they're they're making film

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,939
animation movies they're adding music

00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:10,860
beds and they've gotten really creative

00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:13,170
they're gluing them together and making

00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,149
these videos without having to do any

00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:17,819
extra processing work to stabilize the

00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:20,069
scene in the frame a nicer I should

00:09:17,819 --> 00:09:22,019
mention this is a jquery plugin called

00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:25,860
color box that does a really nice job of

00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:28,110
preloading the next image so I'm going

00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,180
to go back to the interface and I'll

00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:33,209
show you a really common use case which

00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,009
is to search by instrument and that just

00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:36,449
means you want to you want to choose a

00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:38,639
particular camera on a particular

00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:41,850
spacecraft so what I'm going to do here

00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:43,529
is bringing the instrument name widget

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,879
and I've picked New Horizons there

00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:46,829
because there's something interesting I

00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,750
can show you here New Horizons went to

00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:51,420
jupiter and i'm going to pick the moon

00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:56,310
Io from the list and here's a bunch of

00:09:51,420 --> 00:10:01,709
pictures of aya and so um sorry I got a

00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:05,009
little lost here so this interface is

00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:07,620
actually a shopping cart so you can sort

00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:09,149
of pick images you want and then you can

00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,630
do things with them you can download a

00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:14,220
CSV you can create a zip file and so

00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,230
this is sort of the view of what's in

00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,630
your cart and you can interact with the

00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:21,209
images here as you sort of wood in the

00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:23,490
gallery and so one thing about this

00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:25,050
sequence of images so a lot of people

00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,639
are aware of New Horizons because it

00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:29,790
just went to Pluto and got like our

00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,529
first close-up images of Pluto we never

00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,480
know what Pluto looks like before but it

00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:35,430
also had a really interesting encounter

00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,130
at Jupiter lots of things happened I'm

00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:40,170
so will we have all the Jupiter images

00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,519
and when the Pluto images come back down

00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:44,160
and our release to the public will have

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,309
all them all of those too so if you can

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,839
see this moon here where there's a

00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:50,689
little bump on the top it looks kind of

00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:54,480
like a fountain that's kind of bright

00:10:50,689 --> 00:10:56,430
that's actually a volcano exploding just

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,350
as New Horizons was taking pictures of

00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,360
it nobody knew this would be happening

00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:02,499
they plan these pictures to take

00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,599
pictures of i/o and

00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:07,059
it was a volcano exploding at that

00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:09,909
moment so from that sequence we get our

00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:12,669
first and only existing frame animation

00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:20,709
movie of a volcano erupting on another

00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:23,469
world so I go right so so that's a

00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:25,479
little bit closer um that is a 200 mile

00:11:23,469 --> 00:11:27,819
high plume the volcano's name is too

00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:29,199
vast our it's actually over the horizon

00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:33,249
a little bit so you're just seeing the

00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:35,139
edge of it or the top of it so why did

00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:37,959
we do this why did we build opus the

00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:40,059
challenge was that people researching

00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:42,939
outer planets and especially people

00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:44,799
studying reading systems we're having to

00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:46,509
do a lot of extra work in order to get

00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:48,309
the data that they needed and this

00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:51,039
relates to the fact that space missions

00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:54,759
are enormous collaborations if you think

00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:56,439
about a spacecraft we we attach a lot of

00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:58,809
instruments to every spacecraft that

00:11:56,439 --> 00:12:00,759
goes into space here's an example the

00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:02,469
Cassini spacecraft so there's very

00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:05,319
specialized instruments cameras

00:12:02,469 --> 00:12:07,389
telescopes spectrometers and each

00:12:05,319 --> 00:12:09,609
instrument has its own team of people

00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:11,349
that work just on that instrument they

00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:12,939
build the instrument and they'll get the

00:12:11,349 --> 00:12:15,399
data back and they Shepherd the data

00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:18,369
back back to earth and they release it

00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:21,519
on their own websites and NASA has a

00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:25,720
standard for how the data is formatted

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:27,309
and the tools mostly follow that but

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,839
what we're seeing is that people had to

00:12:27,309 --> 00:12:30,279
do a lot of different searching on

00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:33,189
different websites and knowing a lot

00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:37,059
about instruments in order to work with

00:12:33,189 --> 00:12:39,849
the data and this caused frustration so

00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:42,189
we wanted to address this pain point we

00:12:39,849 --> 00:12:44,169
wanted to create a single interface that

00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:47,109
would serve a larger swath of

00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:51,129
researchers and just and we try to make

00:12:47,109 --> 00:12:52,809
it easy to use so who uses it scientists

00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:55,209
use it there's many ways in which that

00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:58,479
saves them time and i'll give you just

00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:59,979
one example of a parameter that people

00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:02,049
who study ring moon systems are

00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:04,389
particularly interested in and which

00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:08,019
opens opus makes easier easier to

00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:10,959
explore and that is phase angle so phase

00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:13,509
angle is just a way of quantifying the

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,150
angle of light in a photograph so if

00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:17,010
you're taking a picture

00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:19,710
and the light is coming from behind you

00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:21,270
that is a low phase angle and if you're

00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:23,070
taking a picture and the light is coming

00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:24,780
from in front of you so that the thing

00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:28,050
you're taking a picture of is backlit

00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:30,720
that is high phase angle so right here

00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:33,540
you see two pictures of Saturn they're

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,930
both of Saturn the top image is at high

00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:40,200
phase angle Saturn is backlit and the

00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:42,990
bottom image Saturn is a is a low phase

00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,780
angle image so the images the light is

00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:47,730
coming from behind the camera and this

00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,900
is sort of the bottom view is more what

00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,640
we're used to see from ground-based

00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,040
telescopes where the Sun is behind the

00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,420
camera and as you can see the Rings look

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,900
very very different at different

00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:00,300
lighting angles so just by changing the

00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,070
lighting angle you can you can change

00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,590
what you pick up in the Rings and this

00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:06,420
um this sort of research allows people

00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:08,160
to learn a lot more about their rooms by

00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,800
looking at them at different lighting

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,200
angles and I'm not sure if you can tell

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,800
in the top image there's like a super

00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:20,250
wide really faint cloudy sort of diffuse

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:23,130
ring um that doesn't even appear at all

00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:25,530
in the bottom image um and that is

00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:28,200
actually the e ring and casino

00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:29,910
discovered this this enormous ring

00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,430
that's not part of the main rings and

00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:35,010
here's a close-up of the brightest part

00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:37,470
of that ring and there's a tiny moon

00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:39,870
there in syllabus and what Cassini found

00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:41,790
is that because Enceladus is actually

00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:44,280
venting water ice from its south polar

00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:46,890
region and feeding this giant diffuse

00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:49,140
ring so how do you do a phase angle

00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:51,360
search I'm going to do one thirst I'm

00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,520
just going to do one against Saturn so I

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,350
pick out Saturn and then go into the

00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:58,140
monster menu and under lighting geometry

00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:59,940
there's a phase angle widget and each of

00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:02,280
the widgets tell you sort of a hinting

00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,770
of what is what are valid values so you

00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,000
don't have to know what our valid values

00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:09,570
so right here I'm just going to pick

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,940
some high numbers 165 to 180 and the

00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:16,050
result that you get is some very pretty

00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:18,300
glowy images of Saturn with rooms that

00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:22,170
are backlit I know several of these you

00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:24,810
can actually see the e-ring whereas you

00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:26,380
couldn't see it in other images so if

00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:28,240
you scroll down

00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,850
a little bit here there's some very

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,580
bright oops sorry there's some very

00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:37,930
bright pictures of the earring and the

00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:40,510
tiny dot in there is in celle des so not

00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:42,520
only do scientists use it a science

00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:45,040
journalist occasional occasional only

00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:47,500
occasionally use it so at the website

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,410
planetary org you can find collections

00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:52,390
of these complete composite images

00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:54,430
created by senior editor of the

00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:56,350
Planetary Society Emily lokta wallah

00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:58,120
she's actually a scientist turned

00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:00,430
journalists and she creates these

00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,620
composite images that show various

00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:04,960
planetary bodies in the same image to

00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:07,090
show scale comparisons to teach and

00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,520
raise awareness about our solar system

00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:12,040
so she uses Opus one looking for images

00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,830
of specific bodies at specific

00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,870
resolutions and specific phase angles

00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:18,460
and she tells me that making composite

00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:21,550
images like this would be 10 times

00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:23,560
harder without this tool another

00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:26,200
community that uses it there's a

00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:28,990
thriving community of people who create

00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,670
color versions of space probe images so

00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:32,650
space probe cameras are black and white

00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:35,200
cameras and they have different color

00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:37,780
filters and so if you can find three

00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,300
images of the same scene taken with a

00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:42,700
red green and blue filter with some

00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:45,280
photoshop skills and some artistry you

00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,980
can make color versions of these

00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,020
spacecraft images and these are much

00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,580
like the colors that your eyes might

00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:54,100
pick up if you are viewing the scene

00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:56,650
directly if you were out there with the

00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,720
spacecraft viewing it with your eyes so

00:16:56,650 --> 00:17:01,090
people like opus because I our gallery

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:05,319
thumbnails are tinted making it easier

00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:07,480
just to find those RGB sets so related

00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:10,120
to image processing and frame animations

00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,860
there's a large format IMAX movie coming

00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,100
out it's in production right now it's

00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:17,290
called in Saturn's rings and it's made

00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:20,770
exclusively for real photographs taken

00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:23,050
by spacecraft and telescopes so they're

00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:25,870
not using any CGI for this movie there's

00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:27,819
no 3d render at all instead they're

00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:29,740
processing over seven and a half million

00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:31,870
photographs taken from various

00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:34,870
spacecraft and telescopes so I play a

00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:37,390
clip from their late summer teaser that

00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,520
they released last year so during

00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,250
production

00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,710
used opus to find suitable image sets to

00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:47,460
to stitch together into large-scale

00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:50,940
panoramas than an animate to create the

00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:54,330
effect of flying through space around

00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:56,940
Saturn so this movie is due out later

00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:59,100
this year so now I switch gears a little

00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:02,640
and talk about my favorite part of the

00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:06,480
interface which is men in your face opus

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:09,810
has a completely open JSON API you can

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,630
make requests over HTTP and get a JSON

00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:15,210
response back so in research that can be

00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:18,030
performed in the Opus interface can also

00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:20,730
be performed via an API call the URL

00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:23,250
structures are the same so what this

00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:25,410
means is that all the data and all the

00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:28,110
images that you can access using the

00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:31,050
interface you can also access from your

00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:34,290
own scripts from the shell from Python

00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:35,820
anything you want via URL inputs so I'll

00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:39,750
show you an example here's one of our

00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:43,200
endpoints for this one I am asking for

00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:44,850
data and I want to inform at JSON and I

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,160
want to do this query planet equal

00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:49,080
Saturn target equals Hyperion that's a

00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:52,260
moon of Saturn and you get this nice

00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:54,810
well formatted JSON response and in this

00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:57,480
case you can also change the dot JSON in

00:18:54,810 --> 00:19:00,540
the URL to dot CSV if you wanted to do

00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,580
that here's another one let's say you

00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:06,120
want images so here I'm asking for

00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:07,890
images size medium and I want it in HTML

00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,300
response this time just so I can show

00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,640
you the pretty pictures in the browser

00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,470
and it's the same query except I've

00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:17,250
added an imaging camera just to make

00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:20,790
sure we get actual images back and so

00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:25,130
you get a big list of Saturn's weird a

00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:29,280
spongy moon Hyperion if you go to the

00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:32,550
URL and change that dot HTML to dot JSON

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,860
you get the same list in JSON and only

00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:39,510
now it's a list of direct links to all

00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:40,950
those images so to find the API you go

00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:43,110
to the moon search interface there's a

00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:45,440
link at the bottom and that gets you to

00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:47,850
our API documentation where we've

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:52,100
documented how to use it and showing

00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:52,100
several examples about how to use it

00:19:52,230 --> 00:20:01,799
we had a tiny tiny team on a tiny budget

00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:03,270
and I know I had to okay and so so Jonah

00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:05,370
is making it possible for us to

00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:09,299
accomplish a lot with very limited

00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:10,799
resources and I have to say the awesome

00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:13,020
icing on the cake is that I've

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,660
experienced the Jado community community

00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:17,760
to be such a supportive community and

00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:20,400
welcoming to beginners because not so

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,320
long ago I was also a beginner so thank

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,080
you awesome Django community for being

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,390
who you are and thank you too Django my

00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,190
tears because we're making space images

00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:31,230
more accessible to scientists

00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:44,580
journalists artists developers and

00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:52,580
everyone and you make this possible so I

00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:52,580
will I can take questions if there's any

00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:01,770
what cool so I noticed on the main page

00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,120
you sort of talked about how you didn't

00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:05,340
like that page very much because it's

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,340
kind of a bit of a monster in designing

00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:10,830
this site were you designing it

00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:14,100
specifically with sort of a scientist in

00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:17,730
mind or were you trying to design it as

00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,840
sort of an open public interface or was

00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:21,000
that sort of something they came along

00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,410
later where you realized that more

00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,940
people might want to use this than just

00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:28,799
for research so we're funded to serve

00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:33,270
scientific research community but my

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:35,100
secret agenda the whole entire time is

00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:37,440
that I think anybody should be able to

00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:40,890
use it so I actually do work to make it

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:44,460
easy to use although that's you know I

00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:46,230
have to weigh different issues but but

00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:49,799
yeah it's always been open and public

00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:52,620
and anybody can use it so I always

00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:54,780
thought also that scientists scientists

00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:56,610
deserve the same quality of tools as

00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:59,370
everyone else like they're not better at

00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:02,690
at figuring out bad interactions than

00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:04,600
other people and so why not like try so

00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:07,750
we try

00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:10,960
I thanks the dog um so you have a lot of

00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:13,690
images and I was curious how do you

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,340
handle so the Sun laning storage and all

00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,810
I suppose that scale of image content

00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:19,360
with Django because like I've often

00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:20,710
found that when you get to you know the

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,360
many hundreds of thousand images Django

00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:23,770
starts to be that the built-in media

00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,900
staff starts walking down so is there

00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:29,530
anything special you're doing there um

00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:31,060
no oh just normal no it's like the

00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:35,590
database to psych a little over a

00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:40,300
million mm-hmm um so no okay that's

00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:41,770
right fantastic thank you I was curious

00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,720
you're talking about how there's a

00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:45,940
community of people who will put the r g

00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,440
and b together is there any way that you

00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:50,440
could do that automated since you are

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,820
doing the tint or is it just a matter of

00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,180
like getting the proper registration

00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:56,680
marks so that you know that you have

00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:59,320
control points and you're actually

00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,820
layering the images right maybe they're

00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,160
not referenced in such a way that you

00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:05,590
can do that I don't know I think there's

00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:08,260
some of that I think there's also some

00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:11,290
judgment calls and how much of the cult

00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:13,120
each color you bring in so sometimes you

00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:14,740
see colorized images and they're they're

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,780
kind of false color they're not really

00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:20,110
what you're I would see technically and

00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:22,420
that's subjective anyway so yeah as I

00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:24,490
understand it there's a lot of judgment

00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:27,160
involved in that but I think a lot of

00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:29,260
things can be automated so who knows I

00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,670
thought of an answer to your question

00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:34,960
over there we actually do use a memcache

00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:36,730
layer to do these queries but the images

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:42,070
yeah they're just coming from our server

00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:44,710
and do you guys self host or do you use

00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:47,940
some kind of cloud provider um to host

00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:54,420
all these all the content we self host

00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:57,430
cool yeah it's a it's a django mysql

00:23:54,420 --> 00:24:01,780
jquery on the front end apache and

00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:04,200
memcache layer okay all right thank you

00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,200
very much

00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,420
