	How I learned Django while working at Eventbrite by Allison Lacker

We all are constantly learning new technologies and strategies to be more effective at our jobs, or just because they interest us. How do you balance the need to stay on top of the latest and greatest changes in our industry with making a product? How do you take a new hire with amazing potential and help them learn everything they need to know, while shipping at the same time?

Shipping code as soon as possible isn't a cutthroat business decision. It helps people learn faster, be more effective, feel more valued, and keeps them centered on the right goals.

How do you balance learning with shipping code? Is there any reason they have to be separate? Too often we feel that these are discrete tasks.

Benefits of learning technology by applying it to real world problems are: - Fixing a real world problem - Learning something that is immediately useful - Remembering it better than if you had learned the theory

Dangers to consider include: - Not everyone learns the same way - Real world problems can be vastly more difficult than you expect, unless you've already solved them - Revealing embarrassing legacy code and decisions earlier than you'd like

thank you I said I'm really passionate

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,420
about accessibility and search and I'm

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:26,490
not talking about either of this a

00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:29,460
little more about me why are you here

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,460
why are you listening to me I grew up in

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,079
Ohio which was really boring so I went

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:39,180
someplace totally different which was

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:40,730
Illinois and I got my computer science

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,550
degree from the University of Illinois

00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:46,620
and then as like man this is still

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,539
actually really boring so I ran away and

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,789
joined the Peace Corps and taught people

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,699
how to use computers in Cameroon with

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,620
the Peace Corps for two and a half years

00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:57,090
and then I came back and I joined

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,510
Eventbrite where I'm a senior software

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,920
engineer but none of that actually

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,470
matters those are kind of like the

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,780
highlights the successes of my life why

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,729
I know something about not knowing

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:15,869
anything is because at each of those

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:18,140
points I didn't know anything so why

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:19,680
should you learn why is it important to

00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,020
what you say

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,060
what sort of programmer are you Allison

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,290
don't you know that our fields always

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,650
changing and there's so many cool things

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,420
you can do it's like yeah yeah yeah but

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,610
why does your company want you to learn

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,890
you always want to but maybe you're

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,150
doing that at night secretly but this

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:40,909
way you should be doing it on company

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:43,020
time first of all there's the bus factor

00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:45,780
if you haven't heard of it it's the

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,280
rather morbid term for how many people

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:52,680
can get hit by a bus and have your

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:55,079
company still function it's also the

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,850
term unicorns which are they're very

00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,280
very people who do exactly what your

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,479
company needs to happen they're called

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,750
unicorns because they're almost

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,369
impossible to find so I say you should

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,939
start as a horse like start working on

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:07,939
growing your horn

00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:16,800
so this is kind of my history of one of

00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,410
learn different things in school I did

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,430
Java and C++ and visual basic and MIPS

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:25,470
and since then I've used none of those

00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:29,430
surprise surprise I don't use oh camel

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:34,020
at Eventbrite the my first job I started

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:36,780
learning HTML and CSS in c-sharp and I

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,860
have not used C sharp since then and

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,520
then at Eventbrite I started with

00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,690
JavaScript and Python and surprised you

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,980
actually need more than just those

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,080
things to do your job

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,730
so you start learning a couple other

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,910
things I started working on our search

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,470
team and learned solar and then really

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,140
you need also some Cassandra and some

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:57,120
Redis and you pick them up one by one

00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:59,730
but it's not just the technologies it's

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,550
not just the languages it's also all the

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:04,800
other tools you need to do your job

00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:07,770
it's vagrant it's docker it's your text

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,390
editor all these things take time to

00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:16,380
learn and you can't just do it

00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:19,260
instantaneously I also think learning at

00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:21,709
a company is actually really awesome so

00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:24,060
for one you have people to talk to

00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:26,340
there's probably somebody there who

00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,510
knows what you're trying to learn and it

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,700
makes a lot of sense to be able to go

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,920
and talk to them instead of finding

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,300
somebody randomly online like be on IRC

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,080
and be like are they going to hate me if

00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,790
I ask them this really beginner question

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,520
there's also a framework already in

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:44,610
place it might be great it might be bad

00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,020
but the last time I did a side project I

00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,700
it took three days setting up my

00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,640
environment and all the technologies I

00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,270
needed so that was knowing how to do all

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,820
those things

00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,260
so just skipping past all of that land

00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,660
in an environment that's already set up

00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:01,170
it's really useful you can figure out

00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,910
the other things later you're doing

00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,830
something that's useful if your

00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,910
company's successful or if you're not

00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,100
then you're trying to make them

00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,810
successful it's something that's a

00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:13,620
product it's gonna get used it's

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:15,420
probably live and probably the most

00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,580
important thing you can't give up if

00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:20,130
you're working on something as your side

00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:22,080
project you can't you can just be like

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,960
oh I have these other things to do I

00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,030
guess I won't work on

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,430
today if you're making something for

00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,380
your company you have to continue making

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,000
it you can't just be like oh it's too

00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:40,060
hard I guess I'll stop working on this

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:41,680
now so how do you do it and I guess in

00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,570
the schedule the title of this was

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,270
actually how I learned django at

00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:49,120
Eventbrite and the talk is actually more

00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:52,150
about how anyone learns anything at any

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,330
company but this is kind of my strategy

00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,889
of how I did it and there's definitely

00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,930
lots of different ways people might have

00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:04,660
different strategies but hopefully it's

00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:06,099
useful for someone so what I always have

00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,940
to do and I always have to remind myself

00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:12,639
to do is do one thing at a time that

00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:15,389
giant list of things to learn don't try

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:19,120
to do them all at once do one of them

00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:21,130
but similarly if you know Django really

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,820
really well and you keep getting

00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:27,400
projects at work that are doing Django

00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,889
over and over maybe expand your horizons

00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,740
maybe try and work on something where

00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:33,970
you don't know anything really try and

00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,760
work on something where you're learning

00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,349
one new thing but you can talk to your

00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,449
manager you can talk to different people

00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:42,550
and say do you need help on that do you

00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:43,150
need help with your go project do you

00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,930
need help

00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:53,530
integrating Postgres into Django and you

00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:55,330
can learn new things that way I'm not

00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,669
sure if anyone in here is a manager a

00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,889
tech lead or a senior engineer or really

00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:01,300
anyone who is making schedules and

00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:05,080
telling other people what they should be

00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:07,479
doing this is actually your job ideally

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,150
people are gonna be coming and saying I

00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:13,659
would love to learn more about

00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:15,849
JavaScript but they might be quiet so if

00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:17,919
you're telling them what they should be

00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:20,259
working on maybe see what they're

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:23,169
interested in try to introduce to them

00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:25,120
new projects maybe there's a perfect bug

00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:27,759
that's a great introduction to something

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,310
new and it needs to get done and only

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,840
one person knows how to do it don't give

00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,169
it to that one person give it to

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,169
somebody else

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:44,280
so when I was in the Peace Corps my

00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:46,440
title was teacher I had classrooms of

00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,590
eighty students which is not efficient

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,960
at all but we did a lot of classes on

00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:54,750
pedagogy and how to teach and how to

00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:58,410
learn and there's lauded for strategies

00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:00,810
but a lot of people talk about visual

00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:03,090
auditory and kinesthetic which isn't

00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:07,100
actually true but humans love

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,100
categorizing so we're gonna go with it

00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:13,500
and you might recognize one of these is

00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,210
how you learn you might say oh yeah I'm

00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,190
definitely an auditory learner I can

00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:21,510
stare at something for days and have no

00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:22,680
idea but if you're a visual learner some

00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:26,370
different ways that are really good to

00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,740
learn our pair programming maybe it's as

00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,960
an observer you should also participate

00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,380
as well but figuring out how somebody

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,320
else is doing it you could read books

00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:40,140
you could read the documentation you can

00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,210
read source code something I've noticed

00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,980
that more junior engineers have trouble

00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:46,470
with is diving into the source code

00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,790
because it seems complicated but that's

00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,130
one of the best ways to figure out

00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:52,410
what's going on especially if there's

00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:55,169
some behind-the-scenes magic you could

00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:57,419
google it you could ask around but the

00:07:55,169 --> 00:08:00,960
fastest way and the best way is probably

00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:03,780
to go and look at the source code you

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,550
can also watch seminars online there's

00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:09,330
udemy and Khan Academy in so many

00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:12,510
different awesome ways so I have stacks

00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:16,890
of textbooks they're fantastic they hold

00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:18,660
up my desk I read them very rarely I

00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:20,640
think once my internet went down and I

00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,169
was actually trying to do something with

00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,410
an a-star algorithm so I looked it up

00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:27,030
but that was really weird

00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:29,280
my roommate on the other hand will order

00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:31,680
basically a new textbook once a month

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:36,900
and actually read it I don't know how he

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:40,140
does it but that's not me auditory

00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:43,169
learners they come to conferences they

00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:46,550
do online classes most importantly talk

00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:46,550
to people ask questions

00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:54,110
and kinesthetic learners if you don't

00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:55,879
remember hearing about auditory visual

00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:58,040
kinesthetic kinesthetic means touching

00:08:55,879 --> 00:09:00,440
things like actually physically doing

00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,110
things with your hands so if you're a

00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,149
kinesthetic learner which is most people

00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:08,240
hack on projects maybe follow some

00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:10,370
tutorials online the things that I

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,350
always do are post-it notes and

00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,879
whiteboarding we have some giant

00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:16,129
whiteboards on our walls that I'll take

00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:17,360
over and scroll all over them it's kind

00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:18,769
of frustrating actually when I'm working

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,879
with people in our Nashville office so

00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:22,300
they'll be like wait what's in that

00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:25,160
corner the lights not hitting it but I

00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:27,199
also used to have two monitors and my

00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,480
second monitor was only used as a place

00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:31,310
to put post-it notes which really

00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:37,339
annoyed my co-workers so they got me a

00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:39,470
whiteboard for behind my desk the most

00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:41,379
important thing to note here is that no

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,490
one is only using one

00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:46,579
everyone needs a bit of all of these

00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:49,310
things so start with what you works best

00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:51,589
for you maybe start on that tutorial and

00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:58,819
if you get stuck maybe go and talk to

00:09:51,589 --> 00:10:01,759
somebody so some tips for working with

00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:04,670
other people the two dogs here the brown

00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:07,519
ones my dog the black one is Leo their

00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,949
best frenemies sometimes they will curl

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,029
up and sometimes still attack each other

00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:14,779
kind of who knows we have to coordinate

00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:17,720
who comes into work but they're kind of

00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:19,189
representative so the best way is to

00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,990
find somebody whose style complements

00:10:19,189 --> 00:10:24,620
yours somebody who you're comfortable

00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:26,689
asking questions to but maybe that

00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,100
person doesn't know everything and so

00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:30,170
maybe there's that one person in the

00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:33,290
corner who you think is gonna bite your

00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:35,269
head off if you talk to them so how you

00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,410
go to that person because odds are

00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:39,199
they're actually not as scary as you

00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:41,809
think some really great ways are to

00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:42,980
schedule time on their calendar don't

00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:45,439
come and interrupt them in the middle of

00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,269
a problem but be like hey I'm trying to

00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:49,220
figure this thing out can I talk to you

00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:51,500
at 3 o'clock because I see you don't

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,040
have anything else to do with don't say

00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,579
it like that

00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,529
they probably have things to do you

00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:58,830
could also talk about what you figured

00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:01,190
out on your own

00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:05,070
if you come to them and you say hey

00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:07,350
what's a model in Django they might be

00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:09,029
kind of annoyed they shouldn't be

00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,070
everyone should be nice and ponies and

00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:13,470
blissful but if you come to them and say

00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,300
hey I read the documentation about what

00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:18,149
a model does and this is my problem

00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:22,410
right here so I'm trying to figure out

00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:24,390
the best way to implement pass codes on

00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:26,880
the model do you think would be better

00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:29,010
this way or this way and it gives them a

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,870
lot better foundation of how to help you

00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:34,740
and where to go and there shouldn't be

00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:37,290
any resentment there another cool thing

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,779
to do is if they're one of those people

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:41,430
who let's say they're the only one who

00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:43,920
knows anything about your payment system

00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:47,700
and so therefore nobody wants to bother

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:50,490
them and they're always busy fixing bugs

00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,950
on the payment system you can go and

00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:55,519
talk to them and say hey I see you're

00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:58,410
really busy I see there's this bug I

00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,660
could fix this bug could you help me

00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:03,060
and then there's no way that they can

00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:11,430
really say no I don't want to do that

00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:14,670
because you're helping them so what

00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:16,459
should you work on so yeah it's your job

00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:20,100
sometimes you have things given to you

00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:21,600
and sometimes you might want to work on

00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,870
something different you might want to

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,870
learn something new but the best things

00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:29,579
to do are to figure out what's really

00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,170
important and then talk to your manager

00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:31,770
and be like hey can I work on this thing

00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:35,010
for a while

00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:36,959
and so those things that you could be

00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:39,779
working on are what's important to your

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,029
company it's a really easy sell to be

00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:44,699
like hey I really need to learn

00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:46,320
elasticsearch because our search needs

00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:49,380
to get better and no one else knows how

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,060
to do it so can I work on it they're a

00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:53,100
lot more likely to say yes than if

00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:55,199
you're like hey elasticsearch is really

00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,790
interesting to me and i'm working on it

00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:59,310
on my side project and i'm starting a

00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:02,100
start-up and hey can I just like take a

00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:06,149
couple days to learn it which they're

00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:08,040
more likely to say no to and another

00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:12,460
thing is what do people complain about

00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:14,790
are the admin tools really bad are

00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,630
the sequel query is really really slow

00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:19,990
maybe you don't know anything about

00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:22,750
sequel but you know that every day your

00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:24,399
admin is complaining about this one

00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,110
query and it's really slow and

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,000
everyone's way too busy and everyone's

00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,050
avoiding it and it might be because

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,690
there's tricky things that you don't

00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:33,490
know about but whatever jump in take

00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:36,279
that query and say I want to make this

00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:39,190
better and you'll make a lot of people

00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:41,980
happy and people also be really really

00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:43,480
willing to jump in and help you because

00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:51,550
it's something that's a pain point for a

00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:54,070
lot of people so you have all these

00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:56,920
things you want to learn how do you do

00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:58,980
it you have your job how are you still

00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,450
being productive while you're doing it

00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:05,110
something that's really important is to

00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:07,360
time box don't spend a week reading a

00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:09,820
textbook about something it might turn

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,089
out that your textbook is about

00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:15,760
Cassandra and then you're like oh wait

00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:18,010
Redis would be better and then all of

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,410
your time is not wasted now you know

00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:23,470
about Cassandra but not relevant you're

00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:26,700
not being productive so give yourself

00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:30,100
some time one of the favorite rules that

00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:32,440
somebody gave me early on is that if you

00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,510
work on something for an hour and you

00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,660
haven't gotten anywhere then you should

00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:39,580
go and talk to somebody you should try

00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,440
and tackle it first yourself because it

00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:45,450
helps you learn better but anything

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,450
longer than an hour go and get help

00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:50,830
prioritizations really important maybe

00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:54,100
elasticsearch is more interesting to you

00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:56,700
but for your company making that sequel

00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:59,220
query faster is much more important

00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:01,570
prioritization is a really hard problem

00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,600
it's not going to be solved in one

00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:06,029
bullet point but try and think about it

00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,680
when you're working on different things

00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:13,510
what's most important you should be

00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:16,029
doing that you should not be turning

00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:21,070
videos of your dog into gifts doing work

00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:22,810
I would never do that another trick that

00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:25,870
doesn't really fit into time management

00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:27,970
but that has really helped me is

00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,760
to leave comments in the code when you

00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:32,680
take a break so it often takes me a long

00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,279
time to contacts which I'm working on

00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,900
some code

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,450
people are like oh let's go get some

00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:40,029
boba yeah it's really nice outside let's

00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:43,180
go outside and then you come back like

00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:44,710
wait what was I doing and then it takes

00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,020
you a really long time to figure it out

00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:50,710
or you might even have a file open

00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:53,140
you're like we're in this file was I so

00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:55,060
I always leave comments and sometimes

00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:57,520
they're inane sometimes it's like I was

00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:59,650
turning the color of this line from blue

00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,180
to red you're like no no I'll remember

00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:08,290
that

00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:09,760
protip you won't so after you've learned

00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,230
everything after you know everything in

00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:15,480
the world as you're going to in the next

00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:15,480
month how do you remember it

00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:31,040
write it down so I'm constantly taking

00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:33,800
notes and you can also be writing

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:38,270
documentation you could be writing bug

00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:41,480
reports maybe you are just getting your

00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:43,670
dev environment set up and it's taking

00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,840
you a really long time and you think

00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:49,130
it's because you have no idea how docker

00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:50,750
works and then an hour in you go and

00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:53,450
talk to somebody and they're like oh you

00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:56,450
don't have this package installed you're

00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:59,350
like wait I just spent so long trying to

00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:00,860
redownload it and it's just failing

00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:03,830
that's probably because the

00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:06,320
documentation is wrong and so either you

00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:08,449
should go and fix it or you could write

00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:13,000
a bug report maybe there's actually an

00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:13,000
error somewhere that should get fixed

00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:21,459
for lists I basically always have at

00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:25,850
least two lists going on

00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:28,670
one is what I've already learned so as

00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:32,810
I'm going through the week I really like

00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:35,140
to be like today I did I figured out how

00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:38,030
to turn videos into gifts it was great

00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:41,000
and then you'll be able to figure out in

00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:43,010
a week or two when you need to turn more

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,810
videos of your dog into gifts how to do

00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:46,940
it you don't have to go through the same

00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:48,860
process of googling because it's really

00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:51,530
easy to forget you do something one time

00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:54,650
and you're like I'm done and then you

00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:56,510
need it again in a week something that I

00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:59,270
actually did when I joined a pup right

00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:01,790
is I had this secret Google Doc where I

00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:04,730
wrote tips I was like this is how I run

00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:06,350
the server this is how I index search

00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,670
and I thought this was really

00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,860
embarrassing that I couldn't remember

00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:11,660
how to run the server or get my

00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,920
development environment up so I didn't

00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,980
tell anyone about it and I had the

00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:18,320
secret document and then I realized a

00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:23,960
couple months later that everyone has

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:26,420
these secret documents so ideally you'd

00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:29,450
be shared or maybe it's just a reminder

00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:31,340
that it's not that embarrassing not

00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:33,530
every company has there a dev

00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,390
environment set up the same way so just

00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:37,670
because you don't remember

00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:40,100
rs I know it's only two keystrokes if

00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:44,840
you forget it it's fine maybe that's not

00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:46,790
how you did it before so it's great

00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,040
documentation for the next people that

00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:50,630
secret document of mine helped when

00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:54,590
somebody else new joined because it'd be

00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:56,960
like wait how do I get the server up how

00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:58,700
do I make it stop threading you'd be

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,520
like oh wait I remember all these things

00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:03,080
because I have this not secret document

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,890
anymore I'm sharing it with all of you

00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:09,530
it's documentation it's also really

00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:12,080
great to be able to say hey look at all

00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:14,090
these things I've learned especially if

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,429
you're in the process of learning lots

00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:18,260
of new things it's really easy to get

00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:20,540
frustrated you might be like I've done

00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:23,540
nothing this week I have all these

00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:25,820
tickets I've accomplished nothing but if

00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:28,549
you look at your list you could say oh I

00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:30,500
figured out how to make sequel queries

00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:33,950
faster and I figured out how to write in

00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:37,970
Cassandra and I've done this tutorial

00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:39,410
and I've read this text book so yes you

00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,929
still need to be closing tickets but

00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:44,840
it's really good to be reflective and

00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:47,210
say what have you done what do you know

00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:51,020
now and also to communicate that with

00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:55,059
people it depends on how your company

00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:57,290
structure is set up but if the main

00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:58,610
record of progress is like how many

00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:00,530
tickets you've closed and you've been

00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,880
spending all your time learning maybe

00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,299
your manager doesn't know what you've

00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,179
been doing

00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:07,130
so communicate that to them say hey

00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:09,580
these are the things I've done look how

00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:12,020
awesome I am

00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,549
it's also really great because when

00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:17,900
you're in that cycle of learning and

00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:19,910
figuring things out you probably have

00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,559
your confidence being lowered be like I

00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,210
don't know anything your imposter

00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:26,720
syndrome is gonna be hitting pretty hard

00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:29,419
if you have it but when you look back

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,549
you can be like oh no I definitely know

00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:33,080
Django like I have that going just

00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:37,970
because I don't know how to write go

00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:41,870
that's fine I know this other thing my

00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:43,790
second list is what you want to learn so

00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:45,770
when you're trying to figuring things

00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:47,960
out it's really easy to go down that

00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,700
rabbit hole to go down that spiral and

00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,100
say

00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,810
there's so many cool things here like I

00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,130
was reading this tutorial and it said

00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:56,380
how I could do multi-threading and I

00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:58,090
said I could do like make a chat program

00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,180
in line you're like I'm really gonna

00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:03,130
follow that and it's like oh wait no

00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:06,160
like I really just need to be figuring

00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:07,450
out how to put words on the screen but

00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,550
you do want to do this eventually

00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:12,040
so put that down is something you want

00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:13,990
to do later let's say you're figuring

00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,410
out how to write sequel queries and

00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:19,780
you're reading some Stack Overflow

00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:21,190
answer and it has a link it says yeah

00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,470
that's a good enough solution but if you

00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:25,720
want to make it a hundred times faster

00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:26,890
you should do it this way and maybe you

00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,140
really want to click on it be like ooh

00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:31,480
how do I go down that rabbit hole but

00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:33,460
you should probably put it aside if it's

00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:36,460
not immediately relevant I would put it

00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:38,850
on this second list and be like hey this

00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:41,050
is what I need to go and do later

00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:43,810
generally I figure out how to go back to

00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:46,030
those when I have that problem again

00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:48,220
maybe I need to make a sequel query

00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,930
faster it's like oh yeah that other time

00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,160
I needed to learn it too so it's

00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:53,440
probably something that's really

00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:59,890
valuable and not just a trendy new topic

00:21:53,440 --> 00:22:02,020
I also know that if I don't write it

00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:04,240
down I'll get really angry at myself for

00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,890
not following it immediately so it's

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,360
kind of like a no I've acknowledged it

00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,840
it's there I don't need to do it right

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:14,020
now

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:18,250
I'll do it someday and the best way to

00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:20,200
learn is actually to teach so people

00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:22,660
often will think I just learned this I

00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,370
am NOT a good person to teach it the

00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,900
people who are best to teach are the

00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:26,320
experts the people who've been doing it

00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,050
forever

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,210
and that's a blatant lie the people who

00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:34,000
are best at teaching new people is the

00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:35,680
people who have just learned it and a

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,380
lot of that is they just went through it

00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:41,760
they remember what was frustrating they

00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,760
remember what was hard

00:22:45,109 --> 00:22:50,460
there's also the pro that sometimes the

00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:52,200
all the set up stuff around teaching is

00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,840
the complicated thing and somebody who's

00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:59,249
dev environment has been set up for

00:22:53,840 --> 00:23:00,929
months is not going to remember so

00:22:59,249 --> 00:23:02,789
there's lots of things that I've talked

00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:04,859
about you should figure out what works

00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:06,899
for you there's lots of different things

00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:08,970
you should take the time to learn it's

00:23:06,899 --> 00:23:12,690
really important no one should ever be

00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:14,519
able to say don't do that especially if

00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:16,289
it's not a priority for your company

00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:18,149
I've been really fortunate that

00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:20,009
Eventbrite has been really flexible

00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:21,659
they've said you know nothing about

00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:24,450
search and you're a JavaScript engineer

00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:28,019
have fun which I don't think is actually

00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:29,850
normal but there's all these tricks that

00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:32,669
you can do you can say hey this has been

00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:34,799
really hard for people there's this one

00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:37,259
person who's the only one who knows this

00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,779
and so if he got hit by a bus like would

00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:43,200
be out of luck but if I learned it then

00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:45,749
I'd be able to help them but most

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,220
importantly again - is to have fun with

00:23:45,749 --> 00:23:48,480
it

00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,470
learning should be fun it's one of the

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,389
my favorite things about computer

00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:53,999
science is there's lots of different

00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:56,190
things you could be doing anything so

00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:59,629
don't get too caught up with frustration

00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:05,100
or by saying I don't know anything to

00:23:59,629 --> 00:24:07,049
have fun that's it this is kind of

00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,609
what's worked for me and what's work for

00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:10,739
people who have talked to but if you

00:24:08,609 --> 00:24:12,179
have any other tricks I want to know

00:24:10,739 --> 00:24:12,659
them I want to add them I want to help

00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:18,080
people

00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:18,080
so tell me please that's it

00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:28,400
what was your first project at

00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:30,870
Eventbrite or your first Django project

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:35,340
yeah my first Django project was

00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:38,820
actually making our teams feature and it

00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:41,400
was really interesting because I had

00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:43,080
been a front-end engineer and I was

00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,680
really good at JavaScript and CSS and

00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,140
like ooh

00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,700
we have to start this project you're

00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,650
being paired with this senior engineer

00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,850
who knows everything about Django so

00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:53,340
you'll do the front ending he'll do the

00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:54,780
back end like cool no problem then there

00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:57,000
were some critical bugs that he had to

00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,800
go and fix and I had nowhere to start

00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,960
she was like hey how about you to setup

00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:04,020
the models for this it's like models

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,060
like what does that mean it like sent me

00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:08,580
a document and I started writing them

00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,720
and he would review all my code but he

00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,340
is actually very busy on other things

00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,790
and I ended up writing most of that

00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:18,390
project so that's really useful did he

00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:20,370
go into production it did it is live it

00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:21,540
is used by tough mudder which is one of

00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,980
our biggest clients so if you've ever

00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:27,510
signed up for Tough Mudder you've used

00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:31,440
my code also do you have any advice for

00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:33,510
uhh this is more like him let's say that

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,290
you're in a situation where your job

00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:39,390
isn't so flexible and you know you've

00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:40,890
besides get another job but I mean how

00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:42,570
you navigate that like if you want to

00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:44,730
work on something else maybe your

00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:45,960
managers not really amenable to that and

00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:48,090
you could always get in their job that's

00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,760
I've been I've been in this position and

00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:52,290
I got another job yeah what's your

00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,900
advice there cuz I could be tough right

00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:56,820
it definitely gonna be tough and I don't

00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,740
want to be like quit like you said but

00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:00,960
there's different things you can do you

00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,580
can try and talk to another team if

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,780
there's maybe there's another team doing

00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:06,240
something that's really interesting to

00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:10,170
you and you can be like hey can I work

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,370
with you and maybe your structure you're

00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,780
a direct manager probably wouldn't like

00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:14,010
that too much but maybe it'd be okay to

00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,540
switch teams and do something more

00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:17,910
interesting and get a manager who's more

00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:19,380
flexible or just try and say okay

00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,960
there's this project we need to work on

00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:25,320
can I do this part of it and just kind

00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:27,180
of like slowly shift so something that I

00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,580
had initially done when I was really

00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:31,590
interested in search is I was doing the

00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:34,419
front-end and I was like oh maybe I can

00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:36,879
just add this new field to the database

00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:38,919
we're busy and then they're like wait

00:26:36,879 --> 00:26:41,980
we're busy so yeah you should do that go

00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:43,239
and do it and so I did and it was great

00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:45,489
but I just kind of had to poke at at it

00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:47,859
for a long time and then we had some

00:26:45,489 --> 00:26:49,029
shuffling and I got a new manager and he

00:26:47,859 --> 00:26:51,009
was like wait you're kind of interested

00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:53,289
like yes it's yours now and threw it all

00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:55,869
on me so some of its like a slow

00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:59,470
progression and sometimes it's dumped on

00:26:55,869 --> 00:27:01,539
you and it's great you mentioned that

00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:03,190
you had like your own secret notes file

00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:04,509
and then everybody you discovered

00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:07,210
everybody had their own secret notes

00:27:04,509 --> 00:27:10,330
file what's been your experience with

00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:12,820
having sort of like a company wiki or a

00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:17,350
team wiki just to collect all this

00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:19,210
knowledge as I've you had like one

00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:22,450
person sort of in charge of that or is

00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:25,359
it just left up for everyone to sort of

00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:27,100
organize or does nobody actually

00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:30,129
contribute and is it's just an empty

00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,960
wiki just what's been your experience so

00:27:30,129 --> 00:27:34,720
we have engineering documentation and

00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,850
it's fantastic when I first started it

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,679
was actually very difficult to edit you

00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:40,149
had to check out the repository with all

00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:41,470
of it you had to make your changes you

00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:43,299
had to commit your changes and then if

00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:45,639
there was any formatting that was wrong

00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:47,379
with your restructured text it would

00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:48,700
send this giant leg blaring email to all

00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:50,529
of engineering being like the build

00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:53,109
failed like the build failed and so

00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:55,330
people were really intimidated for some

00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:57,940
reason didn't want to modify the docs so

00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:59,590
I think one of the best things we did

00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:02,139
there was actually just add a little

00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:04,419
edit link so you could directly edit it

00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:07,570
and then we removed that really horrible

00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:14,889
email and so it became a lot easier for

00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:17,470
people to go in and change it in a past

00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:19,509
life I use a IDE called Eclipse you

00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:21,850
might have heard of it it has one killer

00:28:19,509 --> 00:28:23,710
feature and anywhere you type in to do

00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:25,690
in all caps the string that follows it

00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:27,340
is a cap should have put into a list and

00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:28,989
another pain buried somewhere in the app

00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:30,249
but you can find it if you look hard

00:28:28,989 --> 00:28:31,840
enough and then there's your entire

00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:34,509
to-do list across all your projects I

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,970
wonder is there anything like that that

00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:39,039
you've run into you for Python because

00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:40,389
it seems that that seems like that's I

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:43,359
would use that exactly for the situation

00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:47,600
of okay I'm walking away I need to write

00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:50,330
a note yeah um that's one amazing

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,130
and I don't do things that complex with

00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:53,870
my to do it's more like this is the last

00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:56,840
thought I had I'm shoving it in right

00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:59,030
there but I also use notes

00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,549
embarrassingly enough where I keep a lot

00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:03,350
of my lists so that's kind of the

00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:05,480
equivalent I'm not sure does anyone else

00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:17,210
have an answer to this that I could also

00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:19,299
benefit from okay so you search do like

00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:28,730
a global search for all your to dues

00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:37,100
okay okay so your answer there is

00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:48,730
sublime has a plug-in does pycharm have

00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:48,730
anything harmless for - duze - thank you

00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,510
any other questions

00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:56,620
Thank You Alison okay thank you

00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,680
