great I'm going to actually take one of

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:27,449
those conference pictures because I love

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:30,990
pictures and you can like act all crazy

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:33,510

thank you so yes I am a super excited to

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,370
be here this is a confession this is

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:53,250
actually my first django con in the US

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:56,160
and its I feel like I've kind of peaked

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,520
in my life to like do I came out here

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,890
it's kind of pretty awesome um so yeah I

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,309
was definitely very excited and that

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,659
Jeff emailed me I was just like so thank

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:08,430
you for inviting me and thank you for

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,390
the conference organizers for having me

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:15,540
as well um so yeah first django con us

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:19,619
and what best how best to start off with

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:23,340
i think is a coat from Star Trek so

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:26,280
humor me I'm so I actually couple months

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,619
ago with my fiance we went to the San

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,380
Francisco Symphony to see the simply

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:33,450
play like the whole score to the 2009

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,299
movie and if you ever had an opportunity

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,560
to do that it is freaking awesome but it

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:42,240
reminded me that jewel-anne barracuda

00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,509
producer writer of Star Trek he said a

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,610
few quotes about like the diversity of

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:51,329
the show but it's actually very

00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:54,960
relatable to diversity as a whole so one

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:57,079
in particular he said one obstacle to

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,640
adulthood needs to be solved immediately

00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:01,439
that we must learn not to accept

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,930
differences between ourselves in our

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,290
ideas and but too enthusiastically

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,629
welcome welcome and enjoy them diversity

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,330
contains many treasures as those waiting

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,980
for us in other worlds and we will find

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,200
it in

00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:18,799
two votes of fear diversity and to enter

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,390
into the future at the same time so it

00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:22,580
was very comforting when I first heard

00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:25,489
this quote from someone so prominent in

00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:27,950
the the geek culture I'm actually grew

00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:30,650
up with my father watching like the next

00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:33,980
generation Deep Space nine Voyager II

00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:37,370
all the series I think the next

00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:39,049
generation is my favorite one he's

00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:43,220
actually like the legit my father is

00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:45,470
like legit doppelganger of data which

00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,730
actually dressed for one Halloween even

00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,370
dyed his hair black and I don't think he

00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,590
could get it out after a while but I

00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:54,019
think I have a suspicion that going up

00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:57,680
with with Star Trek in the background

00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:59,510
kind of subliminally influenced me so

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,690
looking at the the TV series as an adult

00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:05,930
and the discourse that they have it's

00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:08,209
very diplomatic right the caracals had

00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,310
very altruistic personal views and they

00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:13,310
apply them to a very difficult

00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:15,680
situations and the whole premise of like

00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:19,730
the Starfleet is is purely humanitarian

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,040
and peacekeeping efforts and then the

00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:24,200
series itself was used to reflect on a

00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:27,200
lot of current than current cultural

00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,900
issues including racism sexism class

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,139
warfare among others Gene Roddenberry

00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:35,690
himself even said that by creating a new

00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:38,180
world with new rules I could make

00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:40,310
statements about sex religion Vietnam

00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,980
politics and turn out intercontinental

00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:45,609
missiles it was very novel to have a

00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:49,280
show like this especially in the 1960s

00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:53,120
many ways now that i have outed myself

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,700
as a Trekkie little bit about me as I

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,160
just said I am I work for Spotify I'm a

00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:01,700
backend engineer and I'm based in San

00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,500
Francisco I'm also one of the two advice

00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:06,680
chairs of the Python Software Foundation

00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,970
board and I'm a part of the code of

00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:13,069
conduct committee and the grants

00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:15,319
committee for the DSF I also lead San

00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:17,510
Francisco pi ladies and do a lot or

00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:21,349
involved in a lot of the global pi

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:23,750
ladies efforts I also i also have a lot

00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:25,500
of stickers with me so if you want to

00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:28,980
come find me afterwards I got play

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:31,170
for you um my name is real quick perhaps

00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,700
I know like what seventy percent of you

00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,320
this is your first genuine con but

00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,840
perhaps like this is your first Python

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,000
conference Django conference ever or

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,640
maybe and you just started to learn

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,010
Python our Jang Geum but to get everyone

00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,560
up to speed past few years there's been

00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:50,030
a huge movement to improve the diversity

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:54,660
makeup of our community for years ago a

00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:57,660
2012 dango con tu in Zurich is actually

00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:00,120
my second conference ever in my first

00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,340
time speaking and I actually talked

00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,890
about how what I was doing a to affect

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:07,830
diversity in the Python community using

00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:09,960
a lot of Django resources and I kind of

00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:12,210
turned more into a conversation / rant

00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,130
but talk about I only found it

00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,169
appropriate to like four years later to

00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:19,800
give sort of an update of how we're

00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:22,200
doing I do want to note that this talk

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,810
and while it's focused on women and

00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:28,200
because I am that's what I work closely

00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:29,910
with the ideals and premise of this

00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,710
should be translated to other minority

00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:35,010
groups as well and within the Python

00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:37,490
community in the tech industry I also I

00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:40,800
swear a couple of times in this talk

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:43,169
it's not like a sailor or anything like

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,020
that but I just to emphasize a point I

00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:47,640
get kind of heated you know very

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,550
enthusiastic about answering a

00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:53,160
conversation points so please feel free

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,419
if if I start kind of saying some words

00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,560
and makes you feel uncomfortable you can

00:05:54,419 --> 00:06:00,450
go ahead and leave I don't mind but um I

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,350
promise don't swear like a sailor sailor

00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:07,950
um maybe get me like a glass of wine or

00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:11,070
something anyways just play sit back and

00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,690
relax i have a link to the slides and a

00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,340
blog post that I wrote up for this at

00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:21,240
the end so I just kind of want you to

00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:22,530
relax a little bit all right so caffeine

00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,470
I need that the two hour flight

00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:28,110
difference is huge Oh to give some

00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:31,110
context and I could try my best to

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:33,599
explain why having a lack of diversity

00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:36,120
is a problem and that we should all care

00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:37,979
about but in reading some research and

00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,729
some sign a few scientific papers I

00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,919
found a few rule

00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:44,430
good highlights that does a better job

00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:46,069
than I ever could one is from the first

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,629
ones from the Harvard Business Review

00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:51,779
there's little correlation between a

00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:54,689
groups collective intelligence and IQ of

00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:56,699
its individual members but when but if a

00:06:54,689 --> 00:07:00,360
group includes more women its collective

00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:02,240
intelligence Rises next one from

00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,050
National Academy of Engineering

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,779
creativity depends on our life

00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:08,339
experiences without diversity the life

00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:10,979
experiences we bring to an engineering

00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:12,569
problem are limited as a consequence we

00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:16,319
meant we may not find the best

00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:19,889
engineering solution from scientific

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,689
american when the groups and when groups

00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:24,059
of intelligent individuals are working

00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:26,069
to solve hard problems the diversity of

00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:28,889
the problem solvers matters more than

00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:30,839
their individual ability thus diversity

00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:33,210
is not distinct from enhancing overall

00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:38,009
quality it's it is integral to achieving

00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:40,620
it and from the same article chronic and

00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:42,419
woeful under under representation in the

00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,399
workforce leads to the inescapable

00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:47,639
conclusion that we're missing critical

00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:49,589
contributors to our talent pool it is

00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,899
hard to grow a work forward workforce

00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:53,039
let alone the best workforce when

00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:56,279
there's a broad under-representation of

00:07:53,039 --> 00:08:00,360
up to 75 percent of the talent of the

00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:02,599
potential talent pool one last one from

00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,099
a different Harvard Business Review case

00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:07,680
after ten years of work experience

00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:09,089
forty-one percent of women in tech leave

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,189
the industry compared to seventeen

00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:13,229
percent of men but they are not more

00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:14,849
likely to leave than the women in other

00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:18,300
industries because of having families

00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:20,789
and so when you look at actual data you

00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:23,279
can see the lack of women across across

00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:25,680
the board there's no major tech company

00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,199
here that has more than twenty percent

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,930
women in tech I want you to take note

00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:33,240
that of this group Yahoo is the only one

00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,279
that allows an employee to self-report

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:39,899
not identifying with the male female

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:41,729
gender I mentioned earlier there's been

00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,529
a large initiative within the python

00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:46,920
django communities to increase diversity

00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:49,579
so what exactly are we doing now

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,700
following list them about to go over not

00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:53,020
exhaustive

00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,850
but where I'd probably be up here for a

00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,180
while which is kind of nice to say but

00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,200
um so I've only picked a few highlights

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:03,040
so I've been on the board this is my

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:05,500
third term on the psf board and in those

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,630
years I've seen a large influx of grant

00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:10,900
requests specifically target for

00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:12,580
diversity initiatives just last month or

00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:15,880
maybe a month or two ago how we approved

00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:18,130
three Django girls funding requests to

00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,780
grants to app icon UK specifically

00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:22,030
targeting to get kids and teachers to

00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:24,160
the conference and two grants for

00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:26,170
workshops in low economic areas or areas

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,840
that would otherwise have difficulty

00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:31,300
accessing computers and on some

00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:34,960
back-of-the-envelope calculations we've

00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:37,510
given grants to over over 20 grants to

00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,760
django girls totaling over about

00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:42,910
twenty-two thousand dollars and just in

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:46,060
the past year we're also trying to be a

00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:48,900
bit introspective as well and the past

00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:51,850
elections a call was made to like the

00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,890
members list to pleading to take

00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:56,170
diversity into account when voting for

00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:59,620
the next board and I would like to think

00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:01,120
that it had some effect because of 11

00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:04,240
positions on the board said of them are

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,550
women and up from three women last year

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:11,220
and to amend the year before so pretty

00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:13,780
awesome within the the Python centric

00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,270
conference network you may have noticed

00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:18,940
an influx of the code of conduct

00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:21,730
adaptation and there's certainly been a

00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:23,890
loud opinion that a code of conduct is

00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:27,690
not needed for conferences and I'm not

00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:30,880
here to explain why they are important

00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:34,750
but a code of conduct isn't necessarily

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,880
for those folks right those who are more

00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:39,490
likely to be affected by harassment or

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,160
assaulting behavior are often the

00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:44,830
minority in an event right they are less

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,440
likely to be visible and there's even a

00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:51,460
timeline on the geek feminism wiki of

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,560
like of public events that has that have

00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:56,170
happened and certainly not an exhaustive

00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,960
exhaustive list but it is actively

00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:01,420
maintained and it just shows that these

00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:04,180
incidents do happen and and when they do

00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,769
we as a community we need to show that

00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,779
those

00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:09,179
that are effective affected that we care

00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:13,069
and that we support them and that we're

00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:16,170
here we want them here too to feel safe

00:11:13,069 --> 00:11:18,170
relatedly november two thousand twelve

00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:21,089
the Python Software Foundation board

00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:23,429
passed a resolution and that will only

00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:27,929
sponsor conferences that has a code of

00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:30,329
conduct in place as well in the past few

00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:32,179
years conferences have also been

00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:34,949
organizing or supporting women only

00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:38,850
events including like pie ladies lunches

00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:42,360
or jen girl tutorials or women attendee

00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:44,879
cocktail hours the like I've led many of

00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,579
these events myself it's super fun and

00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:50,009
every single time I get a lot of praise

00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:54,089
but for being in a room full of women

00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:55,829
that's pretty awesome at the annual Pike

00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:58,829
online shop I ladies lunch at PyCon

00:11:55,829 --> 00:12:00,480
women are encouraged to to stand up and

00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:02,279
basically promote and brag about

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,110
themselves about the talks and tutorials

00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:07,199
lightning talks posters that they're

00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:09,480
given giving and so it might be a little

00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:12,179
bit embarrassing for women to talk about

00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,699
themselves but to have like a space for

00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:17,749
them to deemed okay and encourage gives

00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:20,939
a lot of confidence for this woman

00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:22,850
moving on the BD FL in terms of like

00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:27,149
Python beautiful and Django beautiful

00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:29,779
both Geeta van Rossum and Jake capital

00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:32,279
moss they have been using their voice to

00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:34,699
enthusiastically support and be very

00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:38,369
active in the diversity movements I

00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:41,939
think that that has quite an impact on

00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:45,749
our community having the creators of

00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:47,220
python and django actively or publicly

00:12:45,749 --> 00:12:48,779
talked about the need for diversity

00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,600
within a community a community that

00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:54,240
wouldn't exist without them has had a

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,149
significant impact and I've been very

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,669
lucky that heater is actually in the bay

00:12:57,149 --> 00:13:01,619
area because I certainly make use of his

00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:05,579
close proximity and invite them to a lot

00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:08,369
of Pi ladies events if you take a look

00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:10,319
at other tech communities you can see

00:13:08,369 --> 00:13:13,649
the lack of support from leadership

00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:15,540
really affecting them take the buttocks

00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:17,640
community for example I don't think I

00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:20,610
have to explain much but

00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:23,190
Linus himself and has said that all that

00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:26,490
diversity stuff is just details and not

00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:28,440
that important it's also well known that

00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,870
flame wars are part of the Lennox

00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,390
community and therefore leadership the

00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:36,300
tone that they said it has to affect the

00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:38,400
diversity makeup in some way the a boon

00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:41,550
to community m is four point four

00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,230
percent women the Debian developer

00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:46,590
community is one point eight percent

00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:48,630
woman and I'm looking at the Ruby

00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:51,090
community you can see a lack of

00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:54,060
leadership support there as well a

00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:58,740
conversation in response to rubyconf

00:13:54,060 --> 00:14:00,900
announcing their 2013 talk lineup and

00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:04,580
the lack of like Deborah see speakers

00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:07,500
Matt's the creator of Ruby em had said

00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:09,900
given bias to minority does not solve a

00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,960
problem it just creates reverse

00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:14,490
discrimination now Ruby centric

00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,530
conferences have been very public about

00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:19,220
their lack of diversity when even

00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:22,380
canceled their conference over it and

00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:23,910
ash Dryden very well known ruby

00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:26,340
developer and speaker about diversity

00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:28,290
once tweeted that I am continually

00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:31,020
impressed by the Python community and

00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:32,880
not even a community member and I think

00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:36,150
that she she is a community member if

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,980
she wants to be but the Ruby community

00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:40,650
certainly has done a lot of work right

00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,390
they have rails girls rails bridge and

00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:44,610
the like and the fact that these sort of

00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:47,340
conversations over a speak of diversity

00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:50,700
exists says that like these efforts are

00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:55,020
actually taking effect in some way but I

00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:56,730
can't help imagine if Matt's work was a

00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:59,040
little bit more supportive of diversity

00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:01,890
that or if like Ruby the Ruby language

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:06,690
had something like the psf behind it if

00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:08,370
it may be a little bit better so moving

00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:11,480
on to something I'm deeply involved with

00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:15,150
myself hi ladies holly is a start in

00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,470
mid-2012 and a los angeles and it was

00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:19,290
basically a group of women getting

00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:22,680
together and saying why don't we just do

00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:25,380
this more regularly and so from their

00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:28,230
pilot is expanded to probably over 80

00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:31,050
locations by now haven't calculated it

00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:33,810
yet as 70 locations a couple months ago

00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:35,459
but each year we raised about tens of

00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:38,910
thousands of dollars to help women get

00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:41,640
2pi combo speakers and attendees and of

00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:45,420
those 70 or 80 locations about 50 of

00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:48,060
them are on meetup and from meetup I can

00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:51,149
see that there are over 12,000 members a

00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:54,720
part of Pi ladies and these PI ladies

00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:57,810
the groups we hold events like beginners

00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,779
workshops top proposal brainstorming

00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:03,329
Conrad speaking preparations spray on

00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:06,450
stack Knights code coffee nights a lot

00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:08,040
of fun stuff and actually did um because

00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:10,440
you know I'm a programmer i did some

00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,860
data mining on those 15 meetup groups

00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,839
thanks to the meetup api and i was able

00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:19,589
to get the amount of new PI ladies

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:23,579
joining every month and this is my super

00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:25,560
scientific regression analysis and just

00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:27,209
slept an arrow pointing up you can see

00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,390
the visit definitely like a linear trend

00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:33,300
going upwards and when you take it into

00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:35,610
context of the annual pycon in North

00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,589
America it may have some effect

00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:41,180
inspiring folks to join pilot ease with

00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:44,339
those immediate spikes right afterwards

00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:47,220
and you can see some effect when looking

00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:49,860
at the largest 17 chapters starting I

00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:52,380
don't know why I chose 17 I just did and

00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:56,670
you can see some spiking after or wit

00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:59,180
along with these new chapters so so

00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:01,800
what's the effect of pilot is exactly

00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,910
now a bit of a forum for warning you

00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,010
might have noticed I'm not a

00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:09,380
statistician but I like to play one on

00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:12,959
stage so humor me I'm so for pi con 2013

00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:15,179
pi ladies led workshops for women to

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,069
help brainstorm talk sessions or talk

00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:19,230
proposals with the help of past

00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:22,290
committee members or program community

00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:23,520
members and as well as we give give

00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,500
folks an opportunity to actually

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,089
practice their talks before the

00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,550
conference and we've been doing that

00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:30,809
ever stands for 2013 14 15 and we'll

00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:33,780
definitely do that again for our next

00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:35,970
PyCon and so I'm surely you can relate

00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:38,070
to this there's a CFP that was announced

00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:40,140
and deadlines like in a month and you're

00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:42,270
like oh yeah I want to talk I want to do

00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,740
a talk but i'll submit later and then

00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,140
procrastination gets the best of you and

00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,630
you don't

00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:49,780
the end of submitting a talk but I found

00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:52,270
that a lot a lot of ladies like I

00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:54,490
appreciate that time to sit down and

00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:56,800
actually think about a talk a lot of

00:17:54,490 --> 00:18:00,070
them feel like they don't have an idea

00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:02,440
or a good idea and having that sounding

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:05,650
board of previous program committee

00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:08,050
members of Pi ladies around them really

00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:09,670
helps firm at the proposal and press

00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:12,460
like that green submit button to go

00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:15,190
ahead and submit it and so then talks

00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,690
get accepted and I'm sure other speakers

00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:18,910
can relate that little like oh

00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,470
moment but your talk is accepted now you

00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:22,660
actually have to prepare or actually

00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:24,370
like right all the content I I

00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,690
personally do a lot of conference driven

00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:28,990
development where I don't do anything

00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:31,420
until it gets accept him but to have

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:33,580
someone I have a committee kind of like

00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:36,010
a committee of your peers really like so

00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,690
up you and your idea and a lot time for

00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:39,490
you to speak it's really confidence

00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:41,590
boosting it's very brilliant it's a nice

00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:43,720
feeling and so I'd like to think that

00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:45,880
giving that resource that time two

00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,580
pilots has had effect on the percentage

00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,770
of speakers at PyCon and you can also

00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:53,590
see it on the fact of pilot is in a more

00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:55,510
regional level as well I also took three

00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:58,780
cities i have a large Python Media Group

00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:00,820
a New York Boston and San Francisco to

00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,530
see if the community reflects any

00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:05,650
difference with the addition of their

00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:07,660
local pilot ease now so let's graph it

00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:09,730
shows a number of new members every

00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:11,910
month for to meet ups for a new york

00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:14,080
city python and django new york city

00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:16,600
certainly some of the communities growth

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,660
is attributable to the popularity of

00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:22,110
python as a language overall as well as

00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:25,390
the growth of the startup industry there

00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:29,110
but when you can see at pilot he started

00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:32,410
in mid-2012 and the respective meetups

00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:34,180
and saw a much larger shower growth my

00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:38,350
super scientific regression analysis

00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:41,500
right there and so moving on to the New

00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:44,950
England Boston is also a very great hub

00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:48,160
for a python has a very active django

00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:49,840
meetup and a python user group however

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,940
you don't see a much difference at least

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,950
with the python user group and and the

00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:56,780
growth of new members after pi ladies

00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:58,820
Boston started

00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,500
but perhaps you're familiar some of

00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,720
pilot whose inspiration was actually

00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,300
from the women-only workshops at the

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,120
boston python user group started back in

00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:11,330
early 2011 so you can see the large

00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:14,930
growth rate once a region introduces

00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:16,910
women focused events now on to San

00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:18,770
Francisco my home in the home of the

00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:22,430
largest pilot is we're going to pilots

00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:24,560
location and we have a bunch of Python

00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:26,480
centric meetup groups and I chose

00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,630
specifically like the largest most

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,190
active ones and the growth rate from the

00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:33,260
membership of these meetups and is

00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:37,520
pretty noticeable when SF pilots started

00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:40,490
in April 2012 um again super scientific

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,890
regression but what's interesting here

00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:45,560
as when I switch this to like a lion on

00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:48,650
stacking line graph you can see that

00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:50,660
when SF pie ladies started that the rate

00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:54,260
of new membership specifically for the

00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:56,840
SF Python pub night meetup was not at

00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:58,280
all affected and I suspect that this has

00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,320
to do something with the presence of

00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,590
alcohol and/or the environment that may

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,690
not attract pie ladies anyways this is

00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:08,750
just trying this is me just trying to

00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:10,430
quantify but the effect of the regional

00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:13,190
effect of pie ladies on local meetups

00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:15,860
and if you if you want the data I have

00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:17,450
everything in ipython notebooks set i

00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:21,200
linked in my blog post which you'll see

00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:23,390
at the end alright so we're doing pretty

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,030
good don't you think we've done a lot we

00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:27,770
can see some effect but we're not done

00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:29,900
yet now there's so much more that we can

00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:32,420
do and I'm just throwing money at PI

00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:34,790
ladies isn't going to help it but please

00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:38,510
give us money we appreciate it

00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:40,760
and so a lot of people recruiters and

00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:43,220
developers alike come to me complaining

00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:46,090
about not hiring women are the lack of

00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:49,460
their corporate diversity in general i

00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:51,410
put the same excuses all the time when

00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,660
trying to hear diversity i couldn't find

00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:56,330
them or that we're a meritocracy and

00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:59,510
gender doesn't matter so i'm going to

00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:02,440
introduce my super slick scientific term

00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:06,230
maybe you know it it's called

00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:08,660
these excuses I here are and i

00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:11,030
want to show you why so what is said

00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:14,090
gender equality it's not a problem here

00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:17,660
these things don't matter but actually

00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:18,950
here is it's not a problem to me and so

00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,630
this really shouldn't be said anymore

00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:23,000
it's complete and utter to me

00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:25,760
it's essentially questions the person's

00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,260
beliefs if it's a problem or if it's a

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,630
someone's concerned to increase the

00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:32,450
genders and gender ratio it should be

00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:33,260
treated as a legitimate problem if you

00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,120
don't think it's a problem perhaps

00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:37,580
asking questions trying to figure out

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,950
why like how so what do you think should

00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:42,050
be done and trying to understand a

00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:45,500
problem because why would anything like

00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:47,300
this be said to begin with right so

00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:50,930
another classic one that I here is we

00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:55,580
focus on quality not gender or similar

00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:59,210
similarly we are a meritocracy that's

00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:01,520
 so Lucas thing to me is that

00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:04,400
you find quality to mean software

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,460
written by men but quality is an

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:10,490
objective word right do we encourage bug

00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:12,860
free code or test coverage or elegant

00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:15,830
simplistic code what are the what other

00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:17,780
values do we add to quality and I'm

00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:20,810
hoping that a gender kind of identifiers

00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:22,610
to quality so this excuse is essentially

00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:26,030
saying to me we don't want to change

00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:30,170
what we're doing here all right so I've

00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:33,410
heard this one about girls to women just

00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:36,890
aren't interested in this and this is

00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:38,660
implying that it's women's fault um are

00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:41,210
they are women not really that

00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:44,450
interested and it's complete when you

00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:46,320
can say with me come on I'm

00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:49,529
going to wake you up a little bit

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:52,259
so at spotify we participated in a vent

00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:54,960
in stockholm called tekla it's meant for

00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:57,509
secondary girls when I sponsoring

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,490
companies held workshops to give a

00:23:57,509 --> 00:24:02,309
sampling of what the future holds for

00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:05,279
technology and they had like robots

00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:07,370
computers 3d printing awesomely geeky

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:10,139
stuff that we're all like excited about

00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:12,419
and so this proved that proves that this

00:24:10,139 --> 00:24:16,019
is something that girls are interested

00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:18,000
in so long as they're invited and PI

00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:21,000
ladies itself is proof of that tomb and

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,779
it provides an invitation to women and

00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,700
to join the Python community so this

00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:29,519
one's a classic I hear it so often we

00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,750
couldn't find the women yeah when I

00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:33,840
actually here is that you didn't really

00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:36,710
put enough effort into it and so what I

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:42,539
have to say to that is that's complete

00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:44,429
 so long ago I put out a single

00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:47,399
job ad for Spotify wants to my local

00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:49,679
pilot age group I got 40 responses

00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:51,539
within the first week 40 responses out

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,580
of probably not more than 200 people in

00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:56,100
that mailing list and 40 40 women

00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:58,110
actually responded and so that's a super

00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,940
awesome response rate so I challenge

00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:02,309
folks to actually look at your

00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:05,580
professional network like look at look

00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:07,679
at your LinkedIn profile how diverse or

00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:09,840
your connections how many actually look

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,639
like you are what's the agenda or

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,139
ethnicity or race or whatever like

00:25:11,639 --> 00:25:16,080
what's the distribution among your

00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:17,909
contacts so if you reach out to the same

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,470
network that you always reach out to

00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:22,230
them you're going to get the same people

00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:26,879
applying so yes it will take work but

00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:30,269
the women were out there so this this

00:25:26,879 --> 00:25:32,909
one I've seen a lot of this on the

00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:34,710
twittersphere and on reddit quotas are

00:25:32,909 --> 00:25:36,419
bad that's reverse discrimination and

00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:39,480
this is actually when I get a lot of

00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:42,860
contention on and what this sounds to me

00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:46,830
is you just want to recruit your friends

00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:48,779
who I'm sure also look like you it

00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:51,720
doesn't help that we have like this

00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:53,309
referral bonus culture to hire our

00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,799
friends and I get the reason we want to

00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:59,250
hire people like you that are good like

00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:59,590
you right but it has consequences so if

00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:02,409
you trying

00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:03,850
around maybe so Twitter recently and

00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:05,950
said that they want to increase their

00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:08,020
ethnic minority among their work first

00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:09,640
from eight percent to nine percent so

00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:12,429
what if they said all right so let's

00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:15,760
only hire 91% white people I mean that

00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:18,070
kind of sounds weird right but it it's

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,440
it's incorrect to think that there is

00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:22,210
some sacrifice that will be made that

00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:25,029
your alluring some standards and I have

00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:26,230
to say that that is I so I just

00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:27,669
quoted a bunch of research in the

00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:29,620
beginning that says that that's quite

00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:32,860
the opposite that diversity adds to the

00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:34,960
quality it is indeed illegal in the US

00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:38,980
to make hiring decisions based off of

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,779
gender race ethnicity etc saying

00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,070
something like we must hire twenty

00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:43,990
percent women in the next quarter

00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:46,510
definitely puts that legality into

00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:49,330
question but a lot of us nerds are very

00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:51,399
data driven right um so how r latency

00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:53,770
how we can improve that or up time usage

00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:55,870
statistics I mean we want to measure

00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:58,210
things so we can deliver our product

00:26:55,870 --> 00:27:00,820
better so why not measure how diverse

00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:02,679
our hiring is set goals like increase

00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:05,049
the number of women candidates by twenty

00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:07,029
percent the girl shouldn't be to hire

00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:08,950
twenty percent women but it should be to

00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:13,029
make sure that everyone who is qualified

00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:14,590
is being considered alright the last one

00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:17,110
I'm sure we're all familiar with this

00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:20,169
tech in the tech industry is hiring like

00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:23,049
crazy and they need you need ebbs now

00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:24,730
pretty much and what this means to me is

00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:28,059
that you didn't actually care enough to

00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:31,450
put pot into diversity it into your

00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:34,539
hiring process and that last one say it

00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:38,549
with me that's oh come on wha

00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:41,799
wake up a little bit that there you go

00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:43,450
this simple is that right um do the work

00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:45,370
wants to ensure that you have the

00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:48,549
appropriate practices in place the

00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:50,200
diverse networks maybe remove general

00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:52,570
identifying words in your application

00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,520
process consistent metrics in place to

00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:56,200
see how you're doing it certainly

00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:59,440
doesn't take much effort to google for

00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:01,690
local communities to reach out to so

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,700
what I hear is stemming fail

00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:06,220
thinly-veiled in actual

00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:09,700
 and I'm sure I'm not the only

00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:11,890
one to pick up on on that as well but

00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,090
this is actually hints at a larger issue

00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:16,510
these excuses hint

00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:20,050
at a larger issue there's a fallacy that

00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:22,630
there's a bad guy certainly you get why

00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:24,730
diversity is important you're trying for

00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:26,350
goodness sakes but there's a notion that

00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:29,290
there's a bad guy behind the lack of

00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:31,330
diversity in the in tech mmm there

00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,890
certainly one of attention given to

00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:35,110
someone when they say something bad like

00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:36,850
oh I don't understand why it's bad to

00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:38,710
have booth babes at a conference and

00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:42,370
then everyone's like yeah there's a bad

00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:44,980
guy like I found him right but we didn't

00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:47,170
get here because of one bad guy and

00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:51,010
we're all the bad guy we're all

00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:54,370
complacent we hire our friends we had we

00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:55,900
have very uniform looking network this

00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:59,010
is something that everyone has to

00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:01,330
consciously and actively work towards

00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:03,370
all right so there's all and

00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:05,320
perhaps you agree on the sending

00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:08,740
available and that we need to do

00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:12,460
more so what actually can we do all

00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:15,370
right so have you heard of google yeah I

00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:17,890
hope so so if you if you've heard of it

00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:19,720
actually use it okay numerous amount of

00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:22,960
times and people come to me to educate

00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,520
them I'm not your teacher if you want to

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,920
learn more about feminism about

00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,930
unconscious bias about privilege that's

00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,910
super awesome fantastic and thumbs up to

00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:33,580
you but I'm not going to do the research

00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:36,100
for you I don't have the time nor the

00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:39,190
patience especially for the debates that

00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:41,860
usually happens afterwards but I'm also

00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:43,990
i'm also not your network for women i'm

00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,820
not the gatekeeper to women there are a

00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,800
lot of mailing lists there's meetups

00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:50,320
events go join them get your engineers

00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:52,990
involved to build relationships and I'm

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,600
not going to do the legwork for you use

00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:59,980
Google it's a very fantastic on top

00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:02,830
resource but this one time only um I

00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:04,990
made you a set of like of readings to

00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:07,480
help you kind of if you're interested

00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:09,340
for the self education so memorize this

00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,650
link all right i'm willing to give this

00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:15,880
once actually it's in my blog post too

00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:17,710
so you see it again a band so so after

00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,230
some self education and some googling

00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:23,430
and there are some micro actions that

00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:25,960
you can take my first is super simple

00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:26,730
programmers should like this I'm switch

00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,610
any you

00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:31,860
of the word female to women for example

00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:35,309
female attendees to women attendees and

00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:37,950
you might ask why first um they mean

00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:40,110
different things female is often said in

00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:42,000
a scientific context frequently

00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:44,549
referring to the ability to produce

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,100
offspring the term women's facility

00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:50,669
refers to a human while female could

00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:52,080
refer to any piece any species the

00:30:50,669 --> 00:30:54,660
second reason is it's kind of

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,580
dehumanizing to be reduced to my

00:30:54,660 --> 00:31:00,179
productive abilities you kind of ignore

00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:02,280
them of human and it also excludes folks

00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:03,750
that while identify as a woman may not

00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,150
have the physical ability to bear

00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:11,580
children not all women were born

00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:14,850
biologically female I'm lastly when used

00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:16,530
as a noun it can imply inferiority it's

00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:19,080
often used in a negative town you can

00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:21,960
consent you can see this if you search

00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:24,150
twitter for females i found a couple of

00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,070
interesting quotes and female should

00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:29,210
stop wearing makeup so we all know the

00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:31,740
truth or I can't trust females anymore

00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:34,559
so when we use the word females we were

00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:38,160
reduced to a species and we are separate

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:39,450
and we are other d can you can see what

00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,950
I mean if you want to go search on

00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:43,500
Twitter for the word females but i would

00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:46,350
highly suggest getting a drink first um

00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:48,120
and so around those lines actually

00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:50,669
really think if you need a gendered

00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:54,660
identifier laughs than that you probably

00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:57,750
don't need to for instance at work I am

00:31:54,660 --> 00:32:01,200
frequently introduced as this is Lynn

00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:02,790
our female developer and there there's

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,590
no need for that right there's already a

00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:08,820
word for what I am I'm a

00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:11,429
engineer you can call me crappy lazy

00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:14,490
stubborn whatever but please not a

00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:16,080
female or women developer when when only

00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:18,510
when gender is really relevant to the

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,419
context should you specify it like like

00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:23,100
an event specifically for women so

00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:24,990
another example a few weeks ago I

00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:28,169
received a message on linkedin

00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:30,540
recruitment spam the recruiter said

00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:32,460
exactly this I am really impressed with

00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:35,280
your profile I'm especially impressed

00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:37,080
because you're a woman I don't think my

00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:39,080
hand hit my forehead as fast as it did

00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:42,720
ever

00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:45,990
alright so another micro action is to

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,150
assume knowledge assume everyone has a

00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:51,750
reason to be at this conference or at a

00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:53,310
meetup or workshop wherever not a

00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:56,580
plus-one of someone else not a beginner

00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:59,130
not a recruiter a lot of them to review

00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:01,230
whatever it is that they want to but

00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:04,530
assume their reason for attending is the

00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:06,000
same as yours this probably sounds

00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:08,010
better this one is specifically

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,960
something as female first design for the

00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:11,880
alliteration but there's no reason to

00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:16,230
use female other than for the liberation

00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:18,480
so so women first design make the

00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:21,570
default pronouns and imagery and reflect

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,580
a woman for instance like documentation

00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:25,710
products user profiles form values

00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:28,320
whatever the reason that this is so

00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:30,930
impactful is is that it's signaling it

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,480
signals to lemon that as a developer you

00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:35,730
have thought about them and does not

00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,860
mean patronizing women by painting

00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:41,430
painting your product pink or having

00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:43,440
flowers across everywhere and to see how

00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:45,240
striking a difference it is I encourage

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,130
you to like find one of those browser

00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,770
extensions for whatever browser that you

00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:51,260
use and that Reed switches male pronouns

00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:53,700
to female our gender neutral pronouns

00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:55,890
it's not as funny as like the cloud two

00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:59,310
but one and put them still very

00:33:55,890 --> 00:34:01,680
impactful nonetheless all right so last

00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:04,170
micro action it's very novel I know but

00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:06,690
it's to reach out a couple months ago

00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:09,810
Donald stuff he is one of the maintainer

00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:12,140
zuv pypy I'm he pinged me on IRC he

00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:15,540
needed help with pie pie and both

00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:18,419
maintenance and bug fixing as well as a

00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:19,919
lot of greenfield projects and he

00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:22,110
actually thought he had a thought he

00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:25,650
recognized that there were no women

00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:28,980
behind the scenes of pie p i'm so so get

00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:31,200
this he asked us he asked by ways to

00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:33,020
help alleviate his workload and to be

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:36,300
honest Donovan think you would get much

00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:37,980
many takers to help him out but his

00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,020
disability fan I totally knew this would

00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,760
happen within the first hour of the

00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,740
email he got four volunteers to help him

00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,980
out so this actually works like

00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:49,740
actually reaching out it works

00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:52,020
so micro actions like the low-hanging

00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:54,149
fruit small actions that we can all do

00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:55,950
to help welcome women to the python and

00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:58,290
tech industry as well as your own

00:34:55,950 --> 00:35:01,980
workplace but but not on to the

00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:04,140
difficult stuff it's very comfortable

00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:06,570
hiring working hanging out or

00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:09,240
co-founding a business with people like

00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:11,700
you with your friends but we must be

00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,410
prepared to get uncomfortable one way is

00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:16,350
to take is to take on a sense of

00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:19,560
intentional curiosity okay so remember

00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:20,910
that let me google that for you but well

00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,640
I find it annoying it is indeed

00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:26,280
commendable to want to know more about

00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,260
something it's fantastic but it actually

00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,570
takes work and again I'm not going to do

00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:33,840
that for you but self education is key

00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:36,210
here one thing that's admirable is a

00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,160
sense of curiosity curiosity when

00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:40,340
meeting people not like like you in

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,590
social or workplace situations I'm

00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:46,410
curiosity about what makes a team better

00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:47,700
what what how they work together and how

00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,650
to make it better from where you are now

00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,990
it's essentially going beyond your

00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:54,119
comfort zone and another point

00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:56,760
technology companies have been super

00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:59,010
good at being introspective it's

00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:02,400
embarrassing and uncomfortable to admit

00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:04,830
mistakes but perhaps you've seen it a

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,350
lot when a service goes down a company

00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:10,020
is often very transparent and very

00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:12,420
apologetic about it and we tend to share

00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:13,890
what we've learned in that process but

00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,670
there isn't that same level of

00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:19,440
transparency among the lack of diversity

00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:21,480
we should have post mortems about the

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,760
subject like for instance here are

00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,730
numbers for 2014 and here's your action

00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,580
plan for this coming quarter we need to

00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:31,619
reflect on diversity as a similar

00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:34,290
problem too when a service goes down or

00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:36,119
fail whale and the document for the rest

00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:39,780
of the world I'm basically open up our

00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:42,240
diversity this data isn't exactly like a

00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:44,690
trade secret it's not like Google's like

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:47,160
search algorithm or yelps mrs. rankings

00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:49,530
and it's definitely scary like to admit

00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,000
fault and then some comfortable but but

00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:52,380
wouldn't it be awesome to essentially

00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,060
see that to have a lot of companies

00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:57,480
being introspective about their

00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:59,200
diversity a last bit and this is

00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,170
specifically for for women another mine

00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:05,410
artis is to say what you really think I

00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:07,240
mean this very seriously and I spent a

00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:08,980
few meetings at work and noticing how

00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:12,400
often I would be interrupted

00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:14,980
unacknowledged or just talked over and

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,380
it really made me mad one time I was

00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,000
actually leaving a meeting there's only

00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:21,280
two other people there they kept

00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,690
interrupting me I just got fed up I

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,000
literally said for sake let me

00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:26,589
 speak they did we kind of shut

00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,760
up after that and they've like

00:37:26,589 --> 00:37:30,160
understood because they could see that

00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:33,070
behavior but it felt really good to

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:35,470
finally speak up so in all honesty say

00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:37,630
what you really think rage quit the

00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:39,599
meeting if you have to because otherwise

00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:41,710
it will continue and it will get worse

00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,950
your company may be super behind

00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:46,170
diversity with with hiring but but if

00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:50,859
you don't have a voice at the table

00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:54,190
what's the point all right so enough

00:37:50,859 --> 00:37:56,829
swearing swear to a lot turn turn into a

00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:58,530
bit of a rage inducing monologue but I

00:37:56,829 --> 00:38:00,910
want to finish on a more positive note

00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:04,329
another another Star Trek quote for you

00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:07,420
and so from a Star Trek philosophy and

00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:09,369
gene run Barry said humility will reach

00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:11,829
maturity and wisdom on the day that it

00:38:09,369 --> 00:38:13,420
begins not just to tolerate but to take

00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:15,599
special delight and the differences in

00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:17,950
ideas and the differences in life forms

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:22,030
the worst possible thing that can happen

00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:24,300
to all of us is that is for the future

00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:27,400
to somehow press us into a common mold

00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:30,910
where we begin to act and talk and look

00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:32,910
and think alike if we cannot learn to

00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:35,380
actually enjoy these small differences

00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:37,089
to take positive delight and the small

00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,130
differences between our own kind and

00:38:37,089 --> 00:38:41,079
here on this planet then we do not

00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:43,240
deserve to go out in space and made the

00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:48,329
diversity that is certainly almost

00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:48,329
certainly out there thank

00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,160
