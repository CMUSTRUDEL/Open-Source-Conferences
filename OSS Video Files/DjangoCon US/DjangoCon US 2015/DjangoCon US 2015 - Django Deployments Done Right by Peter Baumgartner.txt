	Django Deployments Done Right

There's no single standard toolkit for deploying Django sites. In our years of consulting, we've seen lots of deployment systems in the wild and where they break down or cause pain. Independent of the system you use (Salt, Ansible, Fabric, Chef, Docker, etc.), there are a few principles a good deployment should follow:

Deployments don't take the site down or interrupt active users on the site.
Deployments don't involve more than one step or are completely automated.
Deployments are fast.
A failed deployment never takes down the current running version of the code.
Rolling back to a previous deployment is a single step.
By following these principles, deployments go from being error-prone, nerve-wracking experiences to trivial non-events in your daily development cycle. This talk will walk you through the steps necessary to create a better deployment process.
