Playlist: DjangoCon US 2015
Description: 
	Django Views: Functions, Classes, and Generics

The goal of this talk is to make views and HTTP as clear as daylight. This talk is for you if you're confused about:

how function views compare to class-based views
when to use generic class-based views-
the difference between class-based views and generic class-based views-
or when to use any of these
This talk will start with an introduction to HTTP and how Django handles HTTP. We will then look at each kind of view in Django, focusing on how each works and why Django implements it that way. This will allow us to look at the advantages and shortcomings of each type of view. Finally, with a full understanding of Django views, we will be able to easily determine when to use each type of view.
