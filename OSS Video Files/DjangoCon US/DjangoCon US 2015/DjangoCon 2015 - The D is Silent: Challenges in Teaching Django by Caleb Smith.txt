hi folks Thanks and so welcome to the D

00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,560
is silent challenges in teaching Django

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,630
my name is Caleb Smith I've programmed

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,960
in a handful of various languages

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:33,500
including Python and more recently i'm

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,050
doing a lot of closure development and

00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,660
i've studied music education and i

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,770
recently taught as an adjunct professor

00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,170
for the school of journalism at the

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:50,039
University of North Carolina Chapel Hill

00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:52,199
wow thanks go heels and yeah and yes we

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,870
we taught Django and that was great time

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:56,539
so I wanted to sort of take this talk to

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,710
sort of reflect on some of those ideas

00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:01,440
some of them you know mistakes and

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,120
successes that that I had with with

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,670
figuring out how to how to teach this

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,210
thing so that hopefully will it will

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:12,390
help you for when you're helping teach

00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:15,390
okay so the first challenge um the D is

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:19,020
silent right okay that's that's kind of

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:21,990
an easy one so it is pronounced Django

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:26,040
okay now what I think will is the

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:27,750
challenge we really can't possibly see

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,360
this right like no matter how big the

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,130
projector is now this chart is actually

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,340
made somebody made it for Ruby on Rails

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,990
I pulled it from the code fellows blog

00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:40,140
but this is all the different skills

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,610
involved right so you know replace Ruby

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,280
with Python replace rails with django

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,409
and it's all the same right so this has

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,780
what you can imagine right it has unix

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,310
command line and text editors right e's

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,320
and version control and test driven

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:56,430
development and you know the list goes

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:59,399
on right and this is only expanding from

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,140
my perspective right so you see rich

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,049
clients and all these things on the

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,240
front end that are expanding um but the

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:08,640
back end isn't always shrinking right

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,649
like isn't it hard to build a micro

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,780
service effectively even if the back end

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:15,150
is small right there's a lot involved

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,920
there's a lot of monitoring right um and

00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,660
this is always changing I don't think

00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,819
this chart I mean this chart is only a

00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,950
year old i don't think it even has you

00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:24,690
know search indexes or message queues or

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,160
you know many of these other pieces that

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,160
we're finding that we're adding to our

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,680
backends right so this is only growing

00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,239
and so I think honestly this is what

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,430
presents the biggest challenge to

00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,200
teaching Django or whatever the

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,660
framework is right is just there's a lot

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,910
involved so you kind of have to unpack

00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,690
it so stepping back from that a little

00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:47,940
bit what what are sort of the core

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,519
aspects of the design of Django and and

00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:53,220
you know I want to say like what does

00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,840
that imply in terms of when you're

00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,850
teaching or learning Django how does it

00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,220
help or how is it may be present a

00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,900
challenge so I think that Django

00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,810
maximizes for the ninety percent case

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:07,800
very well but it tries to be extensible

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:10,140
for uncommon cases also there's you know

00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,150
a high emphasis on documentation and

00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,790
testing there's sort of this batteries

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,950
included approach and you hear a lot

00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,160
configuration over convention right or

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:21,810
as stated in designs in a Python

00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,820
explicit is better than implicit right

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:27,840
so i think that's overall like a good

00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:29,310
overview of of Jango's design so what

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,530
are sort of the benefits of these

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:34,320
choices right good documentation is a

00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,870
clear benefit I think that Django has

00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,390
excellent topic level documentation um

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,920
and I think it serves as a model for a

00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:43,530
lot of other free and open source

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,260
software and that's great um I think

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,269
that the tutorial the official tutorial

00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,670
is actually a great tutorial but i think

00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:52,290
it's not a perfect intro right if you've

00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,820
ever set someone in front of it and said

00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,400
LuAnn Django here's the official

00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:59,190
tutorial it's kind of dense and

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,220
meandering and it's not the best first

00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:04,200
tutorial I would assert that the Django

00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:07,440
girls tutorial is the best first

00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,000
tutorial it's excellent so thanks to the

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,840
community for helping create that it's

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,060
it's amazing ok so another piece is this

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,919
easy access to quality libraries right

00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,320
um with some of the other frameworks

00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:23,520
micro you know smaller frameworks flask

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:25,340
and such um there is there are great

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,919
libraries there right but I

00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,440
the batteries included part of django

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,990
does mean that if you've helped someone

00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,790
install django they already have a lot

00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,010
of great libraries right so at first

00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:39,410
they probably don't need let's say

00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:42,199
caching but in a few months when they do

00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:45,199
it's it's right there right and you kind

00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:47,350
of just help steer them there so that's

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,699
I think a benefit to batteries included

00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:52,790
there's kind of less integration work

00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:55,820
right the javascript pieces are flexible

00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:58,070
because Django is pretty hands-off with

00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,990
respect to JavaScript and not all back

00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,550
in frameworks are I'm often kind of

00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,410
surprised as a Jenga developer when I

00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,960
look at certain frameworks and see you

00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:08,030
know how much it gets into the front end

00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:13,419
right how much it kind of bleeds into it

00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:16,130
and I I think also Django makes reuse

00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:18,050
fairly simple in terms of you add a

00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:20,360
third party app and it can make a lot of

00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:23,270
assumptions about your project knowing

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,190
that it's a Jenga project right so i can

00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:28,240
add a third party app and it knows that

00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:30,710
it has the access to the 0 VAR m right

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,590
and it's not always true with with with

00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:35,990
some other choices i think that the

00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:38,210
configuration over convention has this

00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:39,650
great benefit that at least to me it's

00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:43,340
always felt like an invitation to

00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:45,289
explore it means that as a beginner I'm

00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,360
not ready to learn all of the

00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:48,200
configuration there's a lot right and

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,300
there's different ways you can do

00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,849
layouts but it means that when i'm ready

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,260
to sort of tackle that i can dig and

00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:56,599
even if the rabbit hole gets kind of

00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,190
deep i can go look and say you know what

00:05:56,599 --> 00:06:00,080
is static route what does that do what

00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,300
is it set to and i can i can look it up

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,760
right and i think if you privilege

00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,380
convention over configuration that peace

00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,169
can get a little harder right it's kind

00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:13,490
of harder to know how what the framework

00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:14,539
is doing it's more implicit okay so that

00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,970
said what are some of the challenges

00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:18,470
right so there are some challenges I

00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,870
think one of them is JavaScript

00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:23,120
integration while I appreciate the way

00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,919
that Django has hands off many beginners

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,380
find it kind of challenging because

00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:29,660
there's not a lot of structure right if

00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,760
you come to django and you've done some

00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:35,330
front-end and you say well how do i do

00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,849
ajax right or how do i do these other

00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,940
pieces of sort of integration with

00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:42,740
django

00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:45,870
and it's it's a little bit open right so

00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:48,120
that's one challenge that I think falls

00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,730
out of that design another is that

00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,890
because its batteries included you often

00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:54,660
come across this you know I'm just

00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,610
making a small app do I really need all

00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,490
of Jango right Jane comes with all these

00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:01,400
things and to that you know I would say

00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:04,290
well just because you're not using it

00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,520
right it's fine right you installed it

00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:08,190
it's sitting on a disk somewhere in a

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,590
big deal but I think it does mean that

00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:12,510
you have to focus right you have to kind

00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,850
of focus your instruction when someone's

00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:18,180
starting with chango you don't want to

00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,710
look at all of the pieces yet right if

00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,480
they only want to make a couple views

00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:24,150
they only need a couple models with one

00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,560
relation there's a lot of other stuff in

00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:27,210
the sort of the periphery of Jango that

00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:31,440
maybe they don't really need to focus on

00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:33,810
yet okay and lastly i think that the

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,240
configuration over convention while it's

00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:38,670
what I prefer some people find that

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,430
frustrating right and with can if you

00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:43,620
privilege convention it's a little more

00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,570
easily to sort of hand wave that way

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,980
right and just say oh this is the way

00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:49,470
the framework does it and don't worry

00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:51,930
about it some learners find that

00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,310
frustrating I feel like I do you know I

00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:57,630
say we'll just show me how it works I

00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:59,610
got it all works right but understand

00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:01,590
that some people appreciate that right

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:04,530
and they say this allows me to focus on

00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:07,050
what I need to do because the convention

00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,520
is sort of taken care of so there's kind

00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:12,419
of a trade-off there's what I'm saying

00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:14,700
and so bearing that in mind you know

00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:16,680
given these various challenges what are

00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:20,880
some of the mistakes right that I've

00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:23,340
made or that you often see when people

00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,290
are teaching Django some of these

00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,940
mistakes or it's easy to teach

00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:29,580
everything at once right because there

00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,080
are all these different pieces and so

00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,900
it's important to kind of think about

00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:38,370
what's important first right you can I

00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:40,589
think learn Django effectively um with

00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,810
not knowing a whole lot of Python just

00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:45,990
yet and you learn a lot of Python along

00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:48,450
the way right just like many of us learn

00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,310
JavaScript and didn't know what we were

00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:52,590
doing and just through jquery at stuff

00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:56,190
until after a while we finally

00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:58,830
the actual programming language right so

00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,050
that's okay you don't have to work

00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,950
through an entire you know series of

00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:06,270
Python books to just start with Django

00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,860
the other piece is sort of related you

00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:11,220
know going too deep too soon right so if

00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,720
you get into the depths of like this is

00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,540
everything you'd ever want to know about

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,940
sequel right like you don't have to go

00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,290
there first right and then the other

00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,000
piece I think this falls out of the

00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,740
privileged in configuration because

00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,060
we're familiar with that and because

00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,400
it's an important part of a django

00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,530
project there's often this early focus

00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,450
on like layout and boilerplate pieces

00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:32,910
and and sort of the configuration end of

00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:35,430
things um and and this always makes me

00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:37,230
hesitate like I kind of want to say okay

00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,850
here's a working project here's a layout

00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,320
that works here's all the configuration

00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,810
you're going to need and let's leave it

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,060
alone and like not touch talked about it

00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:46,830
for a while right and then when it's

00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,960
relevant we'll look at that again and

00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:51,870
say here's the configuration and what it

00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:55,350
does right it's easy to just really get

00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:57,570
stuck in the details and say let's let's

00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:01,980
talk about you know exactly what static

00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:03,690
Earl does right for an hour and and

00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:07,080
you'll get people sort of lost very

00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:08,550
easily that way okay so you know sort of

00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,500
this grass is always greener thing I

00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,720
guess I kind of wanted to think about

00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,720
you know what are the other you know

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:20,070
sort of popular web frameworks and how

00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:22,500
does their design differ from Django and

00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:24,510
how does that reflect in how you how you

00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,640
would teach those right how does it make

00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:30,090
them either easier or harder to teach in

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,650
various ways so firstly flask you know

00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:34,530
it's within the Python ecosystem it's

00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:36,240
good place to start I think it is fair

00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,590
to say that it is easier to start with

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,570
something that's just completely dead

00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:42,420
simple right because they've really

00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,980
focused on we're going to make one file

00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:46,410
we're going to make one function and is

00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,500
just going to do a thing right and a lot

00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:52,380
of beginners are attracted to that

00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:54,480
however i would say that as you move

00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:56,250
along you start to structure out the

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,810
thing and it eventually looks kind of

00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:01,950
like a Python project right in terms of

00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:04,350
the layout and it is possible to use

00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,950
Django in this way right so if you look

00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,590
at lightweight Django

00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:10,480
the single file app that they have an

00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:13,090
example of how to do a single file

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:17,440
project in Django is shorter than the

00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:19,390
flask app is actually less code I don't

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,920
think that less code is like the war

00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:25,060
anyone is trying to win with their

00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:27,550
framework necessarily right but just you

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:29,440
know bearing that in mind I think that

00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:32,050
one of the challenges it presents that

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,910
flask presents is that you do have a

00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,290
little more package integration work and

00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,270
you kind of have to pick the right

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:39,460
packages right and what ORM do I need

00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:41,740
and what templating engine do I need and

00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,270
if you're a programmer that's been doing

00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,860
this while you might really appreciate

00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:47,350
that design I'm not saying that's that's

00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,510
a poor design at all but if you're new

00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:51,550
it's easy to see how that could be

00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,960
frustrating right it's like just give me

00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:59,530
the stuff I need I don't know what these

00:11:52,960 --> 00:12:01,660
things do right okay so next node well

00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:04,150
it's not really a framework I know it's

00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:07,030
a runtime but express jsu know pick your

00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:09,340
framework so I think you know one of the

00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,570
common sort of arguments you hear is

00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,400
that you're going to need to learn

00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,870
JavaScript on the front end so you might

00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:18,910
as well use it on the back end less

00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:21,400
complexity boom we're done and okay

00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:24,130
there is an argument there however I

00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:27,190
think that learning python is not a

00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:31,270
serious barrier right to to doing Django

00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:33,400
right like I think python is by design a

00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:35,980
much simpler language to learn right

00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:38,410
when you learn javascript they're good

00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,060
pieces but there's a whole lot of anti

00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:43,330
patterns that you kind of have to learn

00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:46,260
about right um so as a first language

00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:49,480
it's a little it's a little dicey right

00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:52,030
and more important than that though I

00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:55,990
think is that this the evented model

00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:57,430
that node gives you well you may or may

00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,640
not you know appreciate it for your own

00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:02,230
sort of engineering team as a learner it

00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,690
means all of a sudden that I get stuck

00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:06,700
in callback hell and someone sees that

00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:08,140
and says oh what you need is promises

00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,210
and someone else says no you need

00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:12,760
concurrent futures and the learner says

00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:14,890
what are you talking about right this is

00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,240
like way too advanced for what I'm

00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:18,899
trying to do which is build just my

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,369
first basic web app right

00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:22,139
and so hopefully I don't need to worry

00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:26,399
about concurrent futures for that right

00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:29,790
okay one thing that I think is a very

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,610
beneficial two nodes approach is

00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:35,249
something that I I see people stumble on

00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:38,129
a lot as they're learning Django which

00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:41,220
is sort of marshaling JSON and that sort

00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:43,559
of thing right so typically you know you

00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,629
have these big objects as an internal

00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:47,639
representation on the server you've got

00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:50,100
to figure out a way to serialize it you

00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:52,470
know and do kind of all this work it is

00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:55,619
a much simpler mental model to just say

00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:57,569
I pulled JSON out of you know the

00:13:55,619 --> 00:14:00,869
database and I throw JSON across the

00:13:57,569 --> 00:14:02,309
wire and I'm done right now you can

00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:03,959
decide for yourself if you think that's

00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:05,759
a good approach or not right but in

00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:07,709
terms of the mental model of learning it

00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,610
I think that that's that's actually a

00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:15,119
lot simpler than what we typically do

00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:16,499
with Django so uh rails as I was saying

00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:18,300
it's kind of easier to hand wave away

00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:21,149
convention there are certain benefits

00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:23,819
there and there are drawbacks I think

00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:25,980
it's there's more emphasis later on in

00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:28,670
sort of how do I work around rails

00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:31,949
conventions when they don't help me

00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:34,649
which is kind of difficult right I think

00:14:31,949 --> 00:14:38,879
that rails by design is naturally a bit

00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:41,610
more opaque so in my opinion it's sort

00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,499
of less of an invitation to learn which

00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:45,360
to me is kind of an important facet but

00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:48,089
understand that some people that are

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:52,379
beginning with rails do do appreciate

00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:54,120
that design dhh sort of summarized what

00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:56,819
he thought the design of rails was by

00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:00,389
this blog post where he says that rails

00:14:56,819 --> 00:15:01,499
is omakase and if you're not super

00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:04,559
familiar with that because I had to look

00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:06,360
it up he's talking about if you go to a

00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,429
sushi restaurant and you pay like a

00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,049
hundred dollars or something the master

00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:12,449
chef will come and give you all this

00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:15,990
sushi and they pick what they know you

00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:18,209
will like okay and that very much is I

00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:20,160
think the sort of design of rails the

00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:22,259
the framework pics you know the

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,759
conventions and they know you're just

00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:25,499
going to like it right and if you don't

00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,019
like it then you'll eventually acquire

00:15:25,499 --> 00:15:29,160
the taste for it right I mean that's

00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:32,730
that's kind of the argument I think

00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:36,149
they're trying to make ok so I'll bite

00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:37,889
if that's true then I encourage you to

00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:39,720
think of all of these different things

00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:42,449
on a spectrum in terms of their design

00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,360
and in terms of what falls out of them

00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:48,209
in terms of how you how you teach them

00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:51,899
so if rails is omakase I think that node

00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:54,269
is fondue so this is where you you pick

00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:56,879
all the small little tiny ingredients

00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:59,339
and you pay extra because you get to be

00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:02,129
the one that dips it in the cheese so

00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:04,679
what I mean is you pick all these small

00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:08,040
modules and then you get to tie them all

00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:10,319
together and so as a teacher or learner

00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,199
there's a lot of time spent like how do

00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:15,290
I put this thing together right I've got

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,839
this piece that handles multi part of

00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:23,100
purim uploads how do I tie this in right

00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:24,929
that's the cheese um flask is ala carte

00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,199
you look at the menu you pick your own

00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:30,089
RM you pick your templating engine oh

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,889
it's you know kind of further along in

00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:33,899
the spectrum you do have to make those

00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:35,490
choices I think one of the things that

00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:37,559
falls out of that is package management

00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:40,199
is still very important and you have to

00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:42,870
teach it early on and I think it makes

00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:45,120
reuse a little harder right um if I have

00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:47,399
some third-party app it might say I'm a

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,499
flask third-party app and I also need

00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:53,399
this ORM and I need this templating

00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:55,139
engine right okay so i encourage you to

00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:58,589
think of Django is a lunch special and

00:16:55,139 --> 00:17:00,299
that so if i order vegetarian special

00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:03,149
number seven and i know it comes with

00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:05,850
two burritos in an enchilada what I'm

00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:08,039
thinking here is I get an ORM I get a

00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:09,990
templating engine by default right I

00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:11,459
know it comes with that lunch special I

00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:13,139
don't know I have to know that much

00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:14,699
about how to make a burrito or what kind

00:17:13,139 --> 00:17:17,429
of enchilada I want it's part of the

00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:19,439
lunch special however when I'm ready

00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:21,329
when I'm familiar with these things and

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,709
I'm ready to start kind of ordering

00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:24,809
things I'll Lockhart I can make

00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:27,089
substitutions in the special right I

00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:29,429
want number seven but I want to use an

00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:31,200
jalota instead so i can add sequel

00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:33,090
alchemy to my django app or i can add

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,120
ginger templates or i can add this other

00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:38,580
piece right so i think that's where it

00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,290
falls on the spectrum and lastly as I

00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:43,300
said you know rails is imma casei and so

00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:46,090
this means that you know it's I think

00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:48,730
more opaque a little harder to dig but

00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:50,380
it does mean that you you come in and

00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,820
it's kind of taken care of for you so to

00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:55,060
speak right it's just here's your sushi

00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,710
you don't have to choose you're done I I

00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:58,830
do want to encourage you to think you

00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:01,420
know each of these approaches has merit

00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:03,550
you just kind of focus on different core

00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:06,520
aspects of what you know what do you

00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:10,120
really need to teach or learn to excel

00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:11,980
at using that tool okay so barring all

00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:14,020
these tools in mind it's important to

00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:16,660
think about like the different theories

00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:18,700
of learning and how this can help with

00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,140
effective teaching and in the 20th

00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,580
century the the two kind of major

00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,380
schools are behaviorism and

00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:26,140
constructivism and behavior ism is more

00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:28,690
in sort of early 20th century and

00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:32,200
constructivism is very common across

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:33,630
different disciplines these days and one

00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,720
of the people that sort of brought this

00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:41,920
into the four and North America was

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:44,590
Jerome Bruner and in his theoretical

00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:48,190
framework it's based on this theme that

00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:52,720
learners construct new ideas based on

00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:56,680
their existing knowledge right so within

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:59,350
that he talks about what he calls the

00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,600
spiral curriculum and and I think this

00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:03,910
is a very effective way to think about

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,880
tackling a big topic like back-end

00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:08,470
programming so in the constructivist

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,560
view point the foundations of any

00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:14,710
subject can be taught to anybody at any

00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:17,950
stage if it's in the appropriate forum

00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:19,840
and with the spiral curriculum you look

00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:22,060
at the bottom and this is a learner

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,000
that's that's very new to to whatever

00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:28,210
they're doing as you move around the

00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,580
spiral you're visiting different topics

00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:33,100
at a high level so you're touching just

00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:35,320
a moment on this is what HTTP verbs are

00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,910
you're touching just a moment on this is

00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:41,950
generally what a sequel database does

00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:43,900
and so on as you move up you revise

00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:46,630
their ideas build on what they already

00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:50,260
know at that point you add new content

00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:52,140
and as the scope increases and they're

00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,660
learning more different kinds of things

00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,610
they're moving up and the difficulty

00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:59,250
increases and this is how they lead two

00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:00,810
to mastery so at the bottom again is

00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,430
high-level overview and when you get to

00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:04,590
the top that's when you're in the depths

00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:06,300
of let's talk about what a joint is and

00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:10,280
let's talk about using containers and

00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:14,730
yoona kernels and crazy stuff okay and

00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:17,340
within this framework Bruner talks about

00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:19,290
or constructivism more broadly talks

00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:22,590
about seeing the instructors role as

00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:27,030
scaffolding so instructors are sort of

00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:30,000
facilitators for learning and one of the

00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:32,160
key ideas is that the learning

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,340
environment is designed to support but

00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:38,490
also challenged learners thinking so

00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:40,410
sometimes one of the effective teaching

00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:42,930
techniques is to ask just the right

00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:47,060
question to help someone question some

00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:51,270
of their intuition or assumptions and

00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:53,730
lastly with scaffolding the teachers

00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:55,320
role is also just sort of select kind of

00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:58,380
what what's going to be focused on and

00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,910
sort of the scope of everything and in

00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:02,430
the sequencing and we'll talk about

00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:03,990
sequencing in just a moment so

00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:06,630
constructivism to give you kind of an

00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:09,240
overview of how this is used in CS one

00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:11,100
of the in you know CS education in

00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,560
general one of the ways this is done is

00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,450
with logo right so how many how many of

00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,370
you in maybe fourth grade or so like

00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:25,260
looked at logo and played with a little

00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:28,770
bit right sorry um but yeah so it's this

00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:31,050
cold teaching tool it's roughly they

00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:34,110
kind of based the design on lisp but

00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:36,330
what they did was they removed enough

00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:39,090
stuff right to make it really

00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:40,170
appropriate for a fourth grader and it's

00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,850
something they can understand you know

00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,800
it's a turtle right and the turtle

00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,480
represents state in the program right

00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,550
it's this visual representation and

00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:51,090
there's multiple ways to do the same

00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:53,100
thing so it demonstrates program state

00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:54,630
interactive development and eventually

00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,540
you can get two loops and structured

00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:59,190
programming um but you know one of the

00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,900
things you might ask to help someone

00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:03,740
sort of question their own intuition

00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:05,710
would be can the turtle move back

00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:08,720
if you don't have a backward command

00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:10,640
right and the solution to that is you

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,080
know you turn the angle right move

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,950
forward and then turn the angle back

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:18,200
right so with constructivism you're sort

00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,940
of always thinking about what what is

00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,470
their current level of knowledge and

00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,750
what are their current assumptions and

00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:25,790
how do I help them move past those and

00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:30,679
sort of question the ones that that they

00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:32,960
need to so one of your core skills as a

00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:35,900
teacher within using constructivism is

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,820
cognitive modeling and so modeling more

00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,370
broadly is where you just kind of do

00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:42,140
something to demonstrate how it's done

00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:43,760
but cognitive modeling means showing how

00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,710
you're thinking about something which

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,929
can be very challenging right because

00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:49,880
its internal so one of the ways to do

00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:52,670
this is with pair programming and if

00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,230
you're helping someone learn in the

00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:55,910
process of pair programming it's a bit

00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,470
different than you know working directly

00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:00,410
with a colleague and and pair

00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:02,030
programming right and so when you pair

00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:03,740
program with someone that you're trying

00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:06,320
to mentor I encourage you to think about

00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,090
verbalizing you're thinking and sort of

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,910
talk about the problem-solving steps

00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:12,920
right decompose the problem and sort of

00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:14,540
explain how you're thinking about each

00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,790
piece and invite them to kind of follow

00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:19,820
along or question you along the way and

00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:21,200
this will help model for them you know

00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:24,350
the cognitive process that you're going

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:27,550
through so another piece is called

00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:30,200
sequencing and really this is putting a

00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:32,150
structuring instruction into a logical

00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,370
order right starting with one thing

00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:35,990
that's the you know sort of a simpler

00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:39,200
piece and then sort of slowly moving on

00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:41,300
right and you'll hear people argue about

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,730
this kind of stuff sometimes and say

00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,200
things that I think are a little silly

00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:47,350
like they'll say you should really learn

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,970
see before you learn I level language I

00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:52,610
don't think that's true but sequencing

00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:54,440
more specifically is you want to

00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:57,200
decontextualized and then contextualise

00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,390
so when you d contextualize you practice

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,850
or learn a particular piece in isolation

00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:04,370
so you might say let's look at the

00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:06,380
Django ORM in a Python shell and

00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:07,850
practice making different kinds of

00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,610
queries and looking at the data that we

00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:14,480
get back and then contextualizing is

00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:16,550
then putting it back into you know a

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,510
larger project or a larger piece and you

00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:19,790
say okay

00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:21,620
seeing what we did with the orm now

00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:26,060
let's do that in our view so that we get

00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:27,800
the data we need right and along the way

00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,840
with sequencing I encourage you to

00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:32,600
really think hard about the appropriate

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,420
balance of structure and flexibility and

00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:37,550
this can be a difficult balance the more

00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:40,220
structured the learning it's harder for

00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:42,470
learners to construct meaning based on

00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,330
their own conceptual understanding and

00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:47,210
to then extend their meaning into other

00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:49,720
contexts in other words if if your

00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:53,050
instruction is incredibly structured

00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:55,880
it's harder for someone to leave that

00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:59,090
class workshop whatever and apply all

00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:01,160
those skills however if you don't have

00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:04,160
enough structure there's not really any

00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,570
clearer guidance right and people find

00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,770
that frustrating well just tell me you

00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:10,510
know what's the best practice how do i

00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:13,820
do XYZ right so there's a balance there

00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:16,790
to serve as sort of an example of in

00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:20,240
flexibility um I don't mean Java

00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:22,400
specifically but it serves as an example

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,380
of in flexibility in your instruction

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,660
many of us have have attended or

00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:29,570
witnessed sort of a freshman sort of CS

00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:31,760
class where the approach is we're going

00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:34,970
to focus on a given language be at Java

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:37,130
or it could be Python and the approach

00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:38,990
is something like okay in this session

00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:40,730
we're going to learn everything you ever

00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:44,810
wanted to know about anonymous inner

00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:47,300
classes okay so what's the problem with

00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:49,310
that right well we have so much

00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:52,070
structure here and we're kind of going

00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:54,440
on each topic really deeply instead of

00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:57,050
following that spiral curriculum right

00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,360
and at this point the learner probably

00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:00,890
hasn't had an opportunity to see why an

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,450
anonymous inner class would ever help

00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:06,410
them right so instead the constructive a

00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:09,080
constructivist approach that I would

00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:12,260
recommend would be to start with just

00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,850
the basic concepts in isolations you say

00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:16,400
these are strings these are arrays and

00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:18,410
so on and then as soon as you can

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,910
contextualize them and say let's work on

00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:22,940
a simple project that just does this

00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:26,510
small thing and what you'll find is that

00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:28,730
as they work on more projects and you

00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:31,149
increase the scope and you add more

00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:33,860
concepts right as they gain master

00:26:31,149 --> 00:26:35,929
they will find these language features

00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,450
and things on their own right they'll

00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:40,190
eventually say you know I'm trying to do

00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:42,889
this and they'll explain their problem

00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:43,880
and you don't even need to say okay then

00:26:42,889 --> 00:26:46,009
we need to have a lecture about

00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,750
anonymous inner classes all you have to

00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:50,059
say is it looks like you need the

00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:53,000
decorator pattern maybe google that and

00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:55,490
look for inner classes and that's all

00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,190
you need you to say right now the

00:26:55,490 --> 00:27:00,440
learner has enough context enough

00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:02,799
meaning that they can go research that

00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,000
and empower themselves and learn that

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,679
you know so when python that might mean

00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,299
something more like decorators or

00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:11,049
generators or something like that that's

00:27:08,299 --> 00:27:14,059
you know a fairly advanced concept right

00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:15,230
it's not that effective to say I'm going

00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:17,870
to tell you everything you want to know

00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:20,179
about the yield statement right but

00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:22,580
instead as they encounter that problem

00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:25,129
naturally I'm proud I'm processing this

00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:28,309
huge Apache log and it can't fit in RAM

00:27:25,129 --> 00:27:30,590
you say oh you need a generator then it

00:27:28,309 --> 00:27:31,909
will fit and RAM go look it up right and

00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:35,330
then help them you know if they need it

00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:38,269
but I think it's important to kind of

00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:40,519
keep that flexibility going okay so um

00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:42,740
people will often ask about sort of

00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:46,700
various prescriptions I don't always

00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:49,100
honestly feel that I know enough to say

00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:51,200
these these are the resources because

00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:53,809
there are so many great resources right

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,399
and it's really hard to order them to

00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:59,269
write a lot of them address kind of

00:27:55,399 --> 00:28:01,490
different things but if if I'm helping

00:27:59,269 --> 00:28:03,409
someone the the order that i kind of

00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:05,950
think about is that I think the Django

00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:09,950
girls tutorial again is the best first

00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:11,539
intro to django after that i think with

00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:13,850
some coaching the official jingo

00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:16,340
tutorial is good again with with some

00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:18,110
help after that I think someone's ready

00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:19,639
to kind of do a small self-guided

00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:21,259
project on their own maybe just a couple

00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:22,909
of use a couple models and that sort of

00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:24,860
thing and encourage them to kind of look

00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:27,559
up the Django documentation and kind of

00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:29,539
do that after that TDD and python by

00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:31,580
Henry Percival's great book for them to

00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:33,230
sort of self-study and and kind of and

00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:35,000
you know and moving on from there by the

00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:38,090
time they're ready to collaborate with

00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,919
folks on a sort of moderate size project

00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:41,389
that's when it's really great like let's

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,480
get this person hired as a junior

00:28:41,389 --> 00:28:44,740
developer somewhere right

00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,600
because then they're going to need to

00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,700
learn git and github and all these kinds

00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:52,990
of things and that's really hard to do

00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:55,330
by yourself right okay so these are some

00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:58,300
of my ideas about some good some good

00:28:55,330 --> 00:29:00,760
learning tools in a roughly good order

00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:03,040
but again I kind of hesitate to say this

00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:06,310
is one size fits all and the end-all

00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:09,190
be-all of you know how you structure

00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:11,110
janiel learning so I did want to

00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:13,270
specifically thank the creator's

00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:14,860
contributors of Django and also authors

00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:17,590
of documentation and tutorials and stuff

00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:19,540
because you make Django really a joy to

00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:20,800
teach you know I've talked about what

00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,000
some of the challenges are and some of

00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,520
the pain points and some things that

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,260
maybe could be better but but really

00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,060
teaching Django is great and it's

00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:30,430
because of many of you including

00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:32,680
community organizers and and also wanted

00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:35,560
to thank my min mentors at cactus that

00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:38,190
you know taught me Django and thank you

00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,190
for listening

00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:53,740
so if there's time we can do some Q&A

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:57,039
sure so I think he's asking if people

00:29:53,740 --> 00:30:01,000
are learning at different rates and is

00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:02,500
that that's the idea right okay right so

00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,259
the people that are ahead it's kind of

00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:08,200
harder to to catch the other people up i

00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:11,080
think is what he's saying and so um yeah

00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,820
I don't know I I feel like one of the

00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,710
things certainly is while i was at

00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:17,529
cactus the culture was always very much

00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:19,179
a min touring culture of the people that

00:30:17,529 --> 00:30:22,570
were further ahead you know spending

00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:24,340
some time sort of helping and so I don't

00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:26,169
know exactly where all that's that's

00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:28,600
coming from within your organization but

00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:30,909
I would say it's it's good if you can

00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,769
sort of privilege the idea of you know

00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:34,929
lead developers and stuff take taking

00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:36,460
some time to kind of help people and

00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:38,230
maybe that's pair programming and maybe

00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,309
that you know is different kinds of

00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:43,600
things I don't know maybe it's lunch

00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:45,639
talks I don't know but yeah I think we

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,629
want to sort of foster a community in

00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:51,669
which the people that are naturally sort

00:30:49,629 --> 00:30:54,399
of further ahead or something are

00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:56,200
willing and able to sort of take the

00:30:54,399 --> 00:31:00,519
time and sort of foster growth in other

00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:02,860
people sure so she's she's asking if

00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:04,539
you're encouraging people to run into

00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,919
their own problems and then find the

00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:07,990
solution right instead of being

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,370
prescriptive and saying here's you know

00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:11,409
anonymous inner classes or whatever it

00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:15,340
is right then how do you help them

00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:16,779
identify when that's a need and one of

00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,779
the things is that's kind of tricky with

00:31:16,779 --> 00:31:22,659
this is I think that there's a bit of

00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:25,480
internal there has to be some motivation

00:31:22,659 --> 00:31:27,940
so one of the issues is I've seen people

00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,340
before that you know they're doing some

00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,840
let's just say jquery spaghetti and

00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,669
someone says you really need to do

00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,980
backbone like this is going to help you

00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:36,820
you know structure everything but

00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,899
they're lost in the weeds of what

00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:42,009
they're doing and they're saying oh this

00:31:37,899 --> 00:31:44,440
works like this is fine right and so

00:31:42,009 --> 00:31:47,350
yeah it is difficult sometimes but I

00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:50,620
think that the way that I kind of try to

00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:52,510
do it is let them use the hammer for a

00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:55,360
little while to screw in a nail right

00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:56,460
let them feel the pain a little bit and

00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,140
you

00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:01,660
because that is is a really good teacher

00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:03,910
itself right like once the once they've

00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:06,070
gotten deep into you know whatever

00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:08,440
jquery soup they've made right they can

00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:10,920
eventually say oh this is why you're

00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,240
trying to show me another way to do it

00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:16,120
so I hope that addresses the question

00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:20,040
well okay feel free to ask me out in the

00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,040
