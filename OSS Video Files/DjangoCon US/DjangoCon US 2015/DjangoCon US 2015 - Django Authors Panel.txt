what you all do is writing so I'd like

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,689
all of you to answer this question at

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,610
this first one and then some others and

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:54,750
you can decide which ones you would like

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:56,250
to answer so tell us about how and when

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,520
you got involved with Django and want me

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,079
to start down here by you and oh I

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,380
thought you all had already I'm sorry

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:09,390
tried out can you hear me I guess so yes

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:10,410
uh so i started in doing Django actually

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,020
don't remember the year I think four

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,180
years ago doing helping

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,220
with Mozilla developer network that was

00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,220
my first introduction into it and I

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,080
really liked it i started in asp.net did

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,500
some rails and then saw this Jango thing

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,540
and it was kind of a hybrid between the

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,760
two in a few areas and I really liked it

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,700
and so I just kind of stuck with it and

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,470
then from there on the goat Django side

00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,660
like a couple months after I started I

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,880
was like you know I really wish somebody

00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,320
was doing screencasts for these so why

00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,750
don't I do them because no one else is

00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,280
and so I started doing those and that

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,020
really took my learning up to the next

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,330
level and that's kind of its kind of the

00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,560
dirty secret of go jenga was I didn't

00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,350
know what I was doing but I was teaching

00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,510
everyone else how to do it too so so

00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:58,230
everyone was learning with me and there

00:02:54,510 --> 00:03:01,140
still are so yeah that's my dirty secret

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,820
as well yeah I feel like I'm an expert

00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:06,330
in something write a book on it or do

00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:08,280
screencaps I I was a friend developer

00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,750
and designer I started learning Gingka

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,030
four years ago four or five years ago

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,470
because I wanted to launch my startup

00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,540
and everyone said you had to go find a

00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:18,510
co-founder I tried that and it was

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:21,270
horrible so I decided just to learn how

00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,560
to program and do it myself so I've been

00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,600
working about startup ever since then

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,459
but as I was growing my startup and

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,630
becoming a better developer I kept

00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:29,490
thinking back to those original

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,900
tutorials I used and be like oh there

00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:32,370
could be such a better way to teach this

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,030
especially as someone who was like me

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:38,160
with a frontin and design background so

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,010
that's I decided to as a feeling like a

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,360
beginner I decided to jump full into

00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:48,630
writing my own book and how I wish that

00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:50,700
Django was taught my path was I was a

00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:56,930
ski bum and I wanted to make more money

00:03:50,700 --> 00:04:00,290
so became a computer technician

00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:02,359
and then started hosting email for

00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,829
people because nobody had good email

00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:06,319
servers and then they started asking me

00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:10,579
to build websites for him so i started

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:12,769
doing PHP and wordpress and then I

00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:14,900
people asked for more complex web sites

00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:16,900
and I tried to build that stuff in PHP

00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,729
in WordPress and it was painful so i

00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,680
moved to django and yeah i've been

00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:25,280
working with django since i think the

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:30,620
point nine six version and it's been

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:33,500
good yeah I started learning python on

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:37,280
my own I wanted to use it for work I was

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:39,530
working in finance at the time and never

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,500
really called on at work but I really

00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:44,240
enjoyed was doing and then I wanted to

00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,940
build a little website for myself so I

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,729
started to learn Django I I watched some

00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:53,690
show me do screencasts back in the day

00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:57,169
and they were all on 96 but 10 is out a

00:04:53,690 --> 00:05:03,080
bunch of weird errors trying to watch

00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:05,210
the screen cast and yeah eventually I

00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,130
decided to move out of finance and I

00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,349
thought man i really like building

00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:11,389
things with django or what i've been

00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:15,199
learning maybe someone will pay me to do

00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:17,720
this and turns out like by a stroke of

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:26,199
complete luck i ended up at cactus group

00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:28,820
and just as snowballed from there yeah i

00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:32,240
started working on in the startup scene

00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:35,599
in 2011 and after a couple jobs where I

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,419
was working in PHP or rails or

00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:40,039
JavaScript i discovered that i really

00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:43,070
really didn't like any of those tools

00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:46,250
and ended up on a project with python

00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:47,449
and django and said this is it I don't

00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,789
want to deal with those those other

00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:55,130
tools for any of the other websites and

00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:57,230
just kind of stuck with it all right

00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:01,490
thank you good answers

00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:03,140
and okay so one thing that we have to be

00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,400
mindful and one all the publications

00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:07,760
I've worked on actually have all been

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,160
for international audiences and so an

00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,350
open source com for example we have we

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,090
have a huge editorial well lack of focus

00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:17,450
i guess if anything under open source

00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,590
will fit in our and in our site so when

00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,870
you're thinking about your audience and

00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:22,340
he wrote for i'm curious and you know

00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:26,210
what are you picturing is your audience

00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:27,740
is it primarily at north american are

00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,290
you i'm concerned about having your

00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:33,260
works translated as are you picturing

00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:36,080
this being used at a university level or

00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,670
in a professional setting or is this

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,370
something for somebody who's self-taught

00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,540
and doing this at home for fun so tell

00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,070
us a little bit about the audience you

00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:47,900
have in mind for how you're creating

00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:51,860
content um yeah i'll let you all pick

00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:53,270
who decides since okay um as a

00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,040
self-publisher because i still publish I

00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:57,050
don't have a publisher I have to think

00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,550
about all those things myself a lot of

00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,460
it has to be like I kind of like I

00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:04,100
trying to I tried to make it as

00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,360
accessible as possible I'm selling on

00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,620
three different platforms which is kind

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,120
of weird for a lot of people who do

00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,760
self-publishing because most people

00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,760
choose either a pride thing like gum

00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,440
road where you're owning the sales and

00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,360
payment yourself versus amazon which is

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,340
kind of universal but kind of did amazon

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,010
because it is it does sell

00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,500
internationally really well i'm running

00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:26,540
into a problem I kind of tried it

00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,250
maximizes it as much as possible but I'm

00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,570
working a second book in the second book

00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,580
i'm using stripe and stripe doesn't

00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,870
exist internationally which has been an

00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,100
issue because i talked to some people

00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,580
and budapest and they're like well we

00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:39,050
can't use stripe so that's my useless so

00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,180
the long answer is that personally I

00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,710
tried to like make it so anyone for me

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,480
cuz I'm a work in a beginner audience

00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,250
anyone who's totally new can use my book

00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,290
and beginners you will use multiple

00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,160
tutorials and I understand that but I

00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,260
have been running into some

00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:55,610
internationalisation problems don't have

00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:58,390
an answer for it just yet though my

00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:01,130
audience would be probably professionals

00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:02,960
or people who want to be professionals

00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,570
using it and are kind of in the trenches

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,630
I would love to have it

00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:09,700
internationalized but I have an

00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:12,330
had any requests for it yet and it seems

00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:15,790
like a monumental task as a

00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:18,130
self-publisher so you know I'm in the

00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:20,590
same boat that we saw on you know gum

00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:23,890
road and Amazon and a couple other

00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:26,740
platforms so we do get some

00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:28,330
international sales I unfortunately I

00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:32,590
think English right now is sort of the

00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:34,710
de facto technical language which I yeah

00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:37,300
i'm sure it isolates some people but

00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:38,950
right now i think it would just be too

00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:43,870
big of an undertaking to try to

00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:45,220
translate i think there was some effort

00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,350
to translate our book that i wasn't

00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:52,900
really a concern we had when we were

00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:56,350
writing it our audience julie and i we

00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:58,300
wanted to address questions that we felt

00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:00,430
were coming from the community ours is

00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:05,740
definitely that like intermediate to

00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:08,320
advanced user of person people that's

00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:10,260
starting to feel constrained by the

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,880
framework and we wanted to show them

00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:15,700
those constraints only exists in their

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:19,900
mind and that like there are ways to use

00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:24,850
Django in you might not have done before

00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:28,450
or have seen solid examples on Julia my

00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:31,030
co-author would probably be mad at me

00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:35,980
for saying this but I wrote the book for

00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:38,380
the haters I wrote I wrote the book for

00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:41,200
the people that hate Django that want to

00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:49,150
use flask and said that want to use node

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:58,390
instead i wrote for them do you hear

00:09:49,150 --> 00:10:00,250
from the muffin it's for them i spent a

00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:04,810
lot of time thinking about the

00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:07,300
difficulty level and the the sort of how

00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,860
much knowledge people had when they were

00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,300
going to be reading my book and I tried

00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,070
to write for to audiences I tried to

00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,200
write for an audience of people who

00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,670
didn't know how websites worked it

00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,589
didn't understand how web frameworks

00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,660
worked and needed that extra knowledge

00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:21,250
before they could come in and look at

00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,800
the Django documentation

00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:26,320
the web api because an api is great as

00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:29,350
long as you understand the problem that

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,180
it's you're using the problem that you

00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,370
need to solve using that API and then

00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,660
how all that API fits together so that

00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,980
was the first audience and the second

00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,750
audience in the second to third to the

00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,760
book were people who were familiar with

00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:43,470
the problem in the solution and who

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:46,390
wanted an example of some of the

00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:50,410
lesser-known parts of the Django

00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:53,020
framework I'm lucky because I wrote this

00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:56,020
with pearson and pearson handles

00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:58,480
international internationalization

00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,310
rather so it was not something i had to

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,510
actively think about because if they

00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,340
believe there is a market and

00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:05,470
unfortunately i have no say in that

00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,960
please email them directly if you think

00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:10,300
there is they will then go ahead and

00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:14,110
translate it for that market so it was

00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:15,580
not not a real concern of mine I'm going

00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:19,990
to tweak the question for you bit buddy

00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:22,060
and okay so I it mines two part for you

00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:23,080
so what audience did you have in mind

00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,910
and then are you able to get

00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,930
demographics since you're doing video

00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,089
are you able to see who's actually

00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:30,490
watching the video and I'd be curious if

00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:35,920
you had any surprises there or you know

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:37,270
who's watching your videos yeah so to

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,930
take him back to the original original

00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:44,200
question my first thought was supposed

00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:46,420
to take all that into mind okay I mean

00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:51,190
that was a lot I had never thought about

00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:55,660
almost any of that what like oh wow um

00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:58,660
so I i first started go django for me is

00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:01,690
an opportunity for me to learn and let

00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:05,200
other people know what what I've learned

00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:07,089
and from there it's kind of evolved I

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,430
have a kind of a more dynamic situation

00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:11,200
than books because as as I produce more

00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:16,300
content I get more audience and it

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:18,550
buries and so as that's happened it's

00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,620
changed I've watched you knowing with

00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:24,190
Google Analytics the demographic

00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:27,520
information and and it's very normal

00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:30,670
tech industry 20 to 40 mail eighty

00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:33,350
percent mail twenty percent women and so

00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:35,040
like it is the exact

00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:38,880
representation of what the tech industry

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,700
is so but in all honesty I haven't

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,610
really kind of focused much on that my

00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,650
my actual target is more skill level as

00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:49,740
where I try to produce put it at at the

00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:51,930
beginner media to enter media so you've

00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:54,000
done that you've done the polls tutorial

00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:55,920
you may be done the the PI ladies

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,580
tutorial the hello web app and you're

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:02,610
ready to go that one next step that's

00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:05,820
kind of where I try to target what I'm

00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:10,440
doing and recently I've started back

00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:13,020
filling with subtitles and are closed

00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,430
captioning so i found a service that can

00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:18,630
do that that's not prohibitively

00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:21,690
expensive so i can offer the tutorials

00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:23,310
to like hearing impaired that also gets

00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,320
the next level if somebody wants to come

00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,810
in and translate they now have timings

00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,750
to more easily translate it I just I

00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:32,310
can't afford to translate anything but

00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,410
there's opportunity there for

00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:36,900
translation to international languages

00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:38,790
plus it actually helps I've had a couple

00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:41,580
people email me and say hey I would like

00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:43,560
closed captioning because I can read

00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,420
English really well on a king I can't

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,310
listen very fast but I can follow along

00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:50,460
with what you're doing and read at the

00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:52,830
same time so I get the benefits of there

00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:55,320
so as time has progressed I've gone like

00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:57,000
you know who's actually watching and how

00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,280
can I help you know international

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,040
specifically and again hearing impaired

00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:05,130
as well so thank you can you hand it

00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,600
down to Peter and and okay so the next

00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,490
question is about the tools you use for

00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,200
writing and particularly open source

00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:14,220
tools what do you use for writing and

00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:16,320
recording video and text editors or if

00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,940
you're doing any of your own layout you

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,260
know or any of your self publishing or

00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,790
whatever we'd be interested to hear what

00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,380
tools that you like or ones that you've

00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:25,860
tried that you don't like the core and

00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:29,880
why you didn't like them yeah I I used

00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:32,010
Sphinx and I didn't like it it was it

00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:36,990
was pretty painful but honestly I don't

00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:38,910
really know of a much better option some

00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:42,390
of the things that Sphinx does well like

00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:44,910
footnotes and code samples and all this

00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:46,430
stuff really came in handy and when I

00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,350
started to research

00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:52,839
options I always kind of found issues

00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:58,580
that they didn't cover so yeah and then

00:14:52,839 --> 00:15:03,709
layout is using la tech which is I don't

00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:05,270
like even more haha and I had the right

00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:07,279
idea you know I was like I don't want to

00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:09,080
deal with this I had somebody kind of do

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,589
a style guide and then I pitched it over

00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:14,899
to this guy who was a la tech expert and

00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:16,610
to do all the typesetting and he got

00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:19,430
like eighty percent of the way done and

00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:21,920
sort of disappeared so i had to figure

00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:24,200
it out kind of last minute under the gun

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,540
on a deadline which was mostly like

00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,860
googling and pasting in things and

00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,660
finding out what didn't work and then

00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:33,080
googling again and pasting something

00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:35,839
else in so it's really horrible I did

00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,820
not enjoy that part of the process but

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,050
in the end like you know we got

00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:45,260
something that's pretty close to what we

00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:47,120
wanted it to look like so i write in

00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,220
markdown and i'm using right now lean

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,990
pub platform because hello bob bob is

00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,180
also published through glee and put lean

00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:55,490
pub and by writing a markdown using you

00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:57,350
know i save on dropbox i use mac them

00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:58,550
personally just to do my writing so it

00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:01,940
gives me a little bit of highlighting

00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:04,550
and stuff but lean pug will generate the

00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,529
mobile the movie files an ePub files for

00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:08,480
me so I skips the I heard a lot of

00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:10,070
horror stories about la tech or late tag

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,480
whatever it is I heard a lot of horror

00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,190
stories about it and I was like I know I

00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,420
do that and luckily for my book all this

00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:17,870
all my code stuff is actually really

00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:19,760
simple so in markdown lean pub because

00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,260
they do technical books translate it

00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,550
into the digital versions for me and I

00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:25,520
can still the digital versions through

00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:27,470
amazon and then I have a background

00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,720
design so then I'm also able to import

00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:31,160
mark down into InDesign and I could do

00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:36,079
the formatting myself but I do

00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:37,480
everything in worked on oh we actually

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,690
didn't have to make that choice

00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,490
thankfully that's one of the joys of not

00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,750
self publishing we're working with a

00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:47,720
publisher they had a lot of

00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:49,190
documentation we used a ski dock which

00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,279
is very similar to restructuredtext

00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:56,839
accept it compiles to docbook xml rather

00:16:52,279 --> 00:17:00,080
than HTML and very similar format it's

00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:02,150
really nice i like a ski dock

00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:05,180
I would use it again though I have no

00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:08,120
idea how to compile it that's all done

00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:10,730
by their platform we were just cloned to

00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:12,200
get repo we put our ASCII doc files and

00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:15,170
we push them up and then they had a

00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:17,300
platform we press a button and they

00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:22,810
build a PDF and put it on s3 we

00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:25,339
downloaded it was it was magic so I

00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:28,430
don't know how hard that process of

00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:31,430
converting ascii dock into PDF or mobi

00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:33,680
formats actually is but I like the

00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:40,460
process of just writing in ASCII doc

00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:43,670
that was really easy so Pearson doesn't

00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:45,740
have that they probably should should be

00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:47,630
talking to o'reilly about that because

00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:50,210
there was no documentation i was sort of

00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:52,100
told go and do whatever you want the

00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:55,220
problem is is that i wrote in a

00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:58,130
thousand-page book and that's a lot of

00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,990
code and I anytime I tweaked it or

00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:02,090
changed it based on feedback I didn't

00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:04,760
want to have to go in and copy the code

00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:07,160
back in every single time so I started

00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,870
writing and mark down and wrote a script

00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,120
that would take the code from github and

00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:13,220
put it in the markdown accept markdown

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,770
doesn't have references or sort of any

00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,600
intelligent formatting so then I

00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:20,000
extended the markdown using my own

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,690
scripts made it compatible with pan dog

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,450
markdown can compile it into law tech

00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:28,730
and then compile the law tech I'm sorry

00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:30,980
I've horrified you and I tried to do the

00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:33,890
ASCII dog thing I really did and it was

00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:37,130
simply too rigid giving given the what I

00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:46,550
was trying to do with it so um I'm so

00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:50,300
sorry you are a software developer so my

00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:53,330
tool chain is when i first started i

00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:55,640
used a five-dollar screen recording app

00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:59,420
on the App Store absolutely hated it but

00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:02,630
it got the job done and then I Ryan

00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:04,610
Bates had some conversion scripts on his

00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:07,340
repo for rails cast so I copied and

00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,840
pasted those onto my computer and that's

00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:12,160
how I got started now it's a little more

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,880
sophisticated i use i show you HD for

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,960
screen recording

00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:19,100
I use audacity for audio audio recording

00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,100
and then I mix the two together and

00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:25,280
final cut pro I have a couple of custom

00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:29,210
scripts that do my post production stuff

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:32,060
and then I have more custom scripts that

00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:35,450
actually upload everything and set all

00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:38,510
the show notes and and also send it off

00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:41,120
to get the the transcripts and closed

00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,910
captioning done as well automatically so

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,930
a lot of custom stuff that I've done

00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:45,830
thank you we pass it down the market

00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,930
will have him start with the next

00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:49,160
question okay so when I when I write if

00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,990
it's something I'm excited about writing

00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,130
and I have a vision for it it's all

00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,990
written in my head before I start

00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,730
writing and if it's something I need to

00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:57,350
write or have to write and it's where

00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,700
you'll see me doing an outline and all

00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:00,260
of that and so I'm curious about what

00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,180
your processes are and how you decided

00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:04,310
to you know the start writing or

00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,500
recording do you like recording do you

00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:08,930
have a script in mind first or do you

00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:11,330
know wing it and then with writing the

00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:14,150
book did you do an outline and I'd like

00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:16,040
to hear how you do that we had an

00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:18,770
outline as part of the pitch you know to

00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,600
to say this is the book that we want to

00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:23,390
write and that was the the rough guide

00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,550
of what the chapters would be and what

00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:29,240
the subject matter would be and then

00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:31,700
from there a lot of it stem from the

00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,710
thing that we wanted to create though

00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:37,630
that we wanted to walk the user through

00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:41,960
the creation of a van of a project and

00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:46,160
so we'd start by building the project

00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:49,250
from nothing and write it and test it

00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:52,340
and play with it and then we would go

00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:55,610
through it and build it all again from

00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:58,730
scratch and see if we built it the same

00:20:55,610 --> 00:21:01,100
way the second time and then explain how

00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:04,340
we built it step by step that was sort

00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:08,570
of the process and working together we

00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:13,790
also would sort of swap out who would do

00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:17,030
the first draft of a chapter and so I

00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:18,680
would build out chapter one and Julie

00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:22,010
would build a different chapter and then

00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:26,919
we would swap and do the second pass and

00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:29,710
I bright I write really fast in

00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:32,679
herbal and so like I would just produce

00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:38,340
just loads and loads pages of garbage

00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:46,690
and then like Julia would refine it and

00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:49,779
that's that was our process like I mean

00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:51,789
it's it's nice to have a co-author you

00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:55,269
had a co-author as well right it's nice

00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:56,889
to have another set of eyes and that was

00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:59,940
that was definitely part of my process

00:21:56,889 --> 00:22:02,320
is sort of knowing someone's got my back

00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:04,299
before it went to the editor or a

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:15,330
technical reviewer like someone had my

00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:18,100
back before it got to that point um I

00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:20,230
had the I had actually started teaching

00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,850
this as a class and actually had

00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:24,669
intended for a lot of this material to

00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:26,799
actually be screencasts first and it was

00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:28,119
at sort of a test viewing of the

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,220
screencast that someone said you know

00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:32,440
this would be much better as a book and

00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:37,090
so I started off with actually a whole

00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:38,830
bunch of slides and a small repo and

00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,720
that I was used to going through and

00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:42,190
explaining and so when I when I was

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,119
structuring the book it was very much

00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:48,340
from the standpoint of a class it turns

00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:50,980
out i had to i just seriously expand on

00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:52,269
that once we expanded on the book the

00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,129
book was originally intended just to be

00:22:52,269 --> 00:22:56,830
this 300 page thing and then my editor

00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:59,320
at PyCon 2014 said you know we really

00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:01,119
like what you've got can you give us

00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:04,899
more of it and i made the mistake of

00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:07,119
saying yes so at that point i expanded

00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:09,759
the repo and it became a question of

00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,619
sort of scanning through multiple times

00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,809
where i would build the code out and

00:23:11,619 --> 00:23:15,549
then write about it and see what was

00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:18,309
working what wasn't working send it off

00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:20,799
to people and say how do you feel about

00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:22,749
these explanations and then scan back

00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:25,509
through the code is slowly slowly build

00:23:22,749 --> 00:23:30,850
it out and that's sort of how I tackled

00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:33,820
the problem for me the book actually

00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:37,010
started as a kind of like a wrap-up

00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:41,360
letter for a consulting engagement ahead

00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:43,250
and like a recommendations for this

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,870
client we were working with and i was

00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,370
like i could write more on this and this

00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:48,890
is probably helpful for other people and

00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:50,750
like the first five or ten thousand

00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,040
words like happened really fast I was

00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:56,900
like oh that's going to be no problem

00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:58,400
and then and then so I from there I kind

00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,840
of like you know I wrote out a bunch of

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,120
stuff that is all kind of stream of

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,700
consciousness and then it was outlining

00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:08,420
like okay where the gaps here what am I

00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:14,090
missing and then my co-author who had

00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:15,530
you know some knowledge yen Malay he was

00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,720
able to fill in some of the gaps where

00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:20,600
his expertise was you know considerably

00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,610
more than mine and then it was sort of

00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,320
yeah just kind of combing over that

00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:27,650
again and again and refining it and

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:34,270
filling in gaps and you know reading and

00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:36,620
seeing what we missed all that so

00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:39,590
basically take their process and that's

00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:42,740
kind of what I do a mix of all of that

00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:44,930
but for idea generation that's I think a

00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,990
little different for me I took what I

00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:49,550
call the long-term blogging approach

00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:52,850
since I try to release three videos a

00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:57,950
month I have to think very long term and

00:24:52,850 --> 00:25:00,440
so I like to get good ideas that can

00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:04,970
last two months or a month or at least

00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:07,700
two weeks and then I'll spend 10 to 30

00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:09,560
hours coding out over and over several

00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,840
times to make sure I can make a video on

00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:14,210
it and and basically doing everything

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,390
that everyone else talked about but I

00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:18,650
did generation comes from what do I what

00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,570
do I want to learn what's interesting to

00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:24,500
me what does someone asked for I do a

00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:25,970
lot of that and also what do I see on

00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,940
like reddit or stack overflow that

00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:30,650
people are asking about consistently and

00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,410
then what is somebody complaining to me

00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:36,400
about so stuff like this oh that's kind

00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:38,570
of where I start getting ideas for mine

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,980
the process of outlining for my two

00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,810
books that this one and the new one

00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:45,500
that's being funded on Kickstarter right

00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:47,240
now and this book is kind of I started

00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,280
out with the idea of like what kind of

00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,840
what's the basic project I'm EP projects

00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,460
with that someone want to build

00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,260
and then I worked backwards to build

00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,030
chapters in terms of those steps because

00:25:54,260 --> 00:26:00,380
this book is very much go from here to

00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:02,000
here in 11 flow and that was all done in

00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,530
Google Docs because I Google Apps codes

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,450
please they share so I was able to take

00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:07,880
the flow i just feel listed out and

00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:09,410
pullet points each chapter and then i

00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,060
had no tongue each chapter and I kind of

00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:13,310
sent a few people's make sure that

00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:15,020
wasn't missing any bits but dope number

00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:18,350
two the chapters are individual their

00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:20,030
individual exercises and so that's also

00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:22,970
on google docs and i like just because

00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:25,970
it's really easy to share in terms of

00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:27,650
idea generation there i'm still

00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:29,710
finalizing the last chapters of what not

00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:33,440
but a lot of it's just again kind of

00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:35,210
what i wished with this book existed so

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,360
the second book is just intermediate

00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:39,920
concepts has always liked intermediate

00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:42,560
exercises i have had to top myself there

00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,210
wasn't any documentation on online like

00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,070
10 chapters only sauce in bootstrap and

00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:48,560
i knew that something that kind of

00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:49,670
doesn't exist right now so knowing that

00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,930
there was a hole there i was able to

00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:53,990
throw a chapter in and that's kind of

00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:56,950
how i built on a second book okay listen

00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:59,600
start with andrew on this one and and um

00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:01,430
you might not have an answer for this

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,750
andrew since as you said you have a

00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:04,670
publisher and so I'm carries about

00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:06,710
licensing how do you pick how the

00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:09,980
license your material or is it chosen

00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:11,270
for you and if you did get to pick what

00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:14,090
made you decide on the license that you

00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:15,710
decided on so I did I did not get to

00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:18,740
pick and it was not a question I

00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:20,000
realized I could ask I got into a really

00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:22,520
interesting conversation with Harry

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,320
Percival who published his all of his

00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,380
material online under creative common

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,570
license I had been led to believe when I

00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:31,400
signed the contract with Pearson that I

00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:33,530
had no say in the matter and it later

00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,030
turns out that they do allow for some

00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:37,400
flexibility in a Riley allows for some

00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:39,530
some flexibility but so when I signed

00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,780
the contract I was told this is this is

00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:43,960
the only contract you will sign it is

00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:46,790
non-negotiable and that was that was it

00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:52,100
so if you got to pick do you have won a

00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:53,690
favorite in mind um I probably would

00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:58,640
look at the Creative Commons options

00:27:53,690 --> 00:28:00,980
honestly I I showed up at gencon 2013

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,680
with the dual purpose of trying to learn

00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,220
more Django but also to meet people in

00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,530
the community

00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:08,570
at that point had not signed a contract

00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:10,429
with Pearson but had begin the

00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:13,280
conversation with him and I wasn't going

00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:16,610
to write a book for a group of people

00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:18,860
that I didn't like so I showed up and I

00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:20,960
loved the community and i said yes i

00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:23,419
will write this book and so given that i

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,270
wrote a book for the community it seems

00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:28,070
really silly not to just give a lot of

00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:29,929
that away on the other hand i'd also

00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:32,559
like to make money off of this so i'm

00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:34,370
not sure that's the right answer so I

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:43,309
honestly haven't thought a whole lot

00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:46,159
about it I I'm in the same boat um I

00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:49,010
really i mean i have the ultimate choice

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,630
considering i own all of it but I never

00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:54,650
really thought about it and haven't

00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:56,750
because you know I I just want to create

00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:59,090
content for people and it's available on

00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:01,940
my site a bunch of its free bunch of

00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:04,640
it's not and so yeah and I want to make

00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,900
money so I i might think about us

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,960
somewhere but at the moment i just

00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:10,580
retained the full copyright and i just

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,780
go about my day on that just creating

00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:15,740
content that's really what i want to do

00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:18,380
yeah it's a little awkward for me being

00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,880
a beginner tutorial because the there's

00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,650
an excellent django girls tutorial i

00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,570
encourage people to do both but they're

00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:24,980
free and i'm not and that's makes me

00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:27,110
feel awkward sometimes i feel like i

00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:29,150
should release it for free I'm trying to

00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:30,380
make this into my my day job and that

00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:32,960
would be so awesome if I was doing this

00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:35,390
is my day job ergo I need to charge at

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,830
some point so I do retain copyright and

00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:38,990
I tried to release some things for free

00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,980
and it's made some conversations awkward

00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:42,080
but everyone's been super supportive

00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:47,780
that I haven't I've been charging for

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:50,330
beginner content yeah our book is you

00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:51,890
know copyright all rights reserved we're

00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,270
in the same boat I mean it's a

00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:56,809
tremendous amount of work to put a book

00:29:53,270 --> 00:30:00,370
out there I wouldn't do it if there

00:29:56,809 --> 00:30:03,559
weren't some you know other upside and

00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:05,000
we do like we post on our blog and when

00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:06,620
I'm interested in a topic I'll write

00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,620
about in our blog honestly there's

00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:11,960
nothing in this book and my guess is you

00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:14,120
know probably mostly other people's that

00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:17,149
you couldn't find if you dug enough

00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,570
online the point of the book is its kind

00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,460
of

00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:21,050
you have it all in one place and instead

00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:24,590
of spending weeks digging around you

00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:26,540
have it you know all right there so yeah

00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:29,000
it's it's it is a little strange in an

00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:31,520
open source environment to release you

00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,350
know copyrighted pay for material but I

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,390
think if it weren't for that it just

00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:38,930
wouldn't get done you wouldn't have

00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:42,310
high-quality books available if they

00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:42,310
were all kind of free and open source

00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,910
have a small thing to add and and this

00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:49,240
wasn't really a big discussion that we

00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:52,730
had though I did talk to Harry as well

00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:56,630
about the process of him open sourcing

00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:59,690
all of his content I think that's I

00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:02,390
think that's great that it's available

00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:04,220
for free but I feel like even though

00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:06,320
it's available for free and it is

00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:08,090
available on github it's not truly open

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:13,010
source like people aren't collaborating

00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:17,330
on this book together you know this book

00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:19,790
is our vision and like we're not going

00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:21,530
to accept pull requests on like unless

00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:28,370
it's a typo like you're not going to

00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:32,210
change the book for us so I don't know I

00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:33,260
guess we can make it open like so that

00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,700
people could download it and try to

00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:37,840
build it themselves though it would

00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:41,420
never happen like it would never work

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:44,690
but it's not really open source in

00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:45,830
essence I just remembered there's

00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,910
actually a chapter that's my

00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,980
installation instructions that are on

00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:50,780
github and I originally put it up there

00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:52,430
because I knew that insulation stuff

00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:57,230
would change fast I didn't want my book

00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:59,600
to go out of to uh be old information

00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:00,620
too fast and I put on github and I was

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,380
talking about the book and people

00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:05,840
actually have I mean little things like

00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:08,150
finding typos someone gave me a whole

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,980
thing for how to install on linux like

00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:11,810
some things I hadn't filled out I have a

00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,760
page on there with extra resources and

00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:17,240
it was really cool seeing people come in

00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:19,370
and help out with this because I put the

00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,450
information on this a repository it was

00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,490
kind of cool so it's like a tiny little

00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:24,710
open source area that people have

00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:27,169
helping out with and

00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:28,760
well that was an entire question because

00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:30,200
I've worked under many licenses with the

00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:33,140
different publications I worked on and

00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:35,330
and they and I was honestly curious

00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:36,830
because people have different things

00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:38,750
that they found work for them you know

00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:41,210
or different motivations for writing and

00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:42,649
i remember at linux pro which is not an

00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:44,480
inexpensive magazine it's about a

00:32:42,649 --> 00:32:46,340
hundred dollars a year very low add

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,919
count though and we counted on

00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:50,330
subscribers and you know occasionally

00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:51,980
people would say information wants to be

00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:54,440
free and my responses well I don't work

00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:55,940
for free you know and I expect to get

00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,770
paid for writing and editing and so

00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:00,080
someone's got to pay me you know and so

00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:01,070
um but there are many different models

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,340
at work for different people obviously

00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:05,600
and so we have about 10 minutes I have

00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,890
more questions I can ask but I want to

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,500
make sure that everyone here gets a

00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:12,409
chance so let's take audience questions

00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:14,600
and there's a mic over here and then if

00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:16,429
we have time i will ask more at the end

00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:20,570
so i don't think we'll have time for my

00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:24,320
question so long time ago I wrote a

00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:27,950
Drupal book um so from that experience I

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:32,929
asked how did you maintain your sense of

00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:34,760
wellness doing the work I mean that's a

00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:37,130
serious question because you're kind of

00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:41,149
working all the time how do you maintain

00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:47,260
health balance this question is

00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:52,480
predicated on the fact that we did um

00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:56,029
yeah no I mean again I don't know how

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:59,450
y'all that don't have a co-author did it

00:33:56,029 --> 00:34:02,779
by yourself it's insane I did it by

00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:06,380
being carried by Julia at times and I

00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:09,230
carry Julia when she needed me it was

00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:12,320
not i'm not good at work life balance I

00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:14,119
work like all the time and I work in the

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,800
book and then I go run and I sleep and

00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:22,669
that's you know everything that I do

00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:26,510
every single but I don't know it's like

00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:28,820
we did for the challenge I yeah I would

00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:31,960
say how did we find how did I find a

00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:31,960
balance I didn't find a balance

00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,880
I have a start-up so when I get burnt

00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,380
out my startup I go to writing and when

00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,940
I get burnt out i'm writing I'll go back

00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,890
to my startup and I'm lucky to have that

00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,630
flexibility to do that with my hours I

00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:46,480
end up working twenty-four/seven on one

00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:48,010
to the other but it does help me to

00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,050
contact switch and it allowed me to work

00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:53,800
on this without like feeling like it was

00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:57,850
like a terrible terrible job I set very

00:34:53,800 --> 00:35:00,120
strict deadlines um from basically when

00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:03,430
I leave in the morning at 6am and

00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:06,880
basically till I get home around four

00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:08,650
like that's my full-time job and I don't

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,310
do my full-time job outside of that and

00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:15,250
then I do family stuff until about six

00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:18,430
and then from six to nine I three days a

00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:19,750
week I do go Django stuff and so I have

00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:21,820
to make sure my process is extremely

00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:24,400
streamlined to make sure I fit it in

00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:27,280
there and then I'll do saturday morning

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,710
before noon sometimes to get stuff and I

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:37,720
just and my wife reminds me if I start

00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:39,430
deviating out of that so I just have a

00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,350
question about kind of the process so I

00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:44,230
did a three hour tutorial here at django

00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:45,730
con and I felt so overwhelmed and that's

00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:48,130
you know one tenth of the amount of

00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:49,180
content and I found when I would go in

00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:51,810
to try and do something I would just

00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:53,620
kind of get lost in all that there was

00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:55,120
it's like oh there's a reference here

00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:57,700
that goes there how do you kind of think

00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,990
about like taking a small amount of

00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,910
works like I'm just gonna work on this

00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:03,190
chapter or like how do you like deal

00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:05,920
with the breadth of information that you

00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:12,490
have and actually just focus on where

00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:14,440
you need to be working divide and

00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:17,290
conquer is sort of the short answer no

00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:20,290
seriously I because I was so focused on

00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:24,070
demonstrating code I made sure that all

00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:27,340
of the the code was heavily annotated in

00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:29,050
github and all of that I knew which

00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:31,150
commits was in which chapter any

00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:34,420
commands that I had run at that point

00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:36,310
were in the github notes and I was I was

00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:38,350
writing notes as I went and that way

00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:41,230
anytime I was writing about that I could

00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:42,940
simply look at the list of commits see

00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:44,380
which ones were relevant to that chapter

00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:46,150
and then begin looking through the notes

00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,630
that I had written to myself while I was

00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:49,000
building

00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:51,160
and then add to notes that I had written

00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,759
to myself on the side in a text editor

00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:59,920
and try and pick that up but there is a

00:36:53,759 --> 00:37:02,769
substantial amount of information um I

00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,839
yeah just to add I think you really have

00:37:02,769 --> 00:37:07,509
to know your audience and focus on your

00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:09,940
audience your book can't be everything

00:37:07,509 --> 00:37:11,319
to everyone or your content can't be

00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:14,740
everything to everyone so it's

00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:16,390
constantly like can I cut this like it

00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:18,549
you know your tutorial is about writing

00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:20,200
documentation like do they really need

00:37:18,549 --> 00:37:24,269
to know this they really care about this

00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:26,650
you know having a focus just saying like

00:37:24,269 --> 00:37:28,349
this can be covered by another book like

00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:32,019
we didn't really cover testing which is

00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:34,210
not great but there's other great books

00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:36,549
about testing and our book can be about

00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:39,910
what it's about and didn't go by Harry's

00:37:36,549 --> 00:37:41,140
book instead we have about five more

00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:43,480
minutes so and I think everybody

00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:45,009
probably happy to talk in the hallway

00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:49,329
track around breaks later so let's go

00:37:45,009 --> 00:37:50,650
and let Jacob ask a question first off

00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:55,269
thank you all so much has been really

00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:56,890
fantastic so many years ago I had a

00:37:55,269 --> 00:37:58,210
publisher someone who worked in

00:37:56,890 --> 00:38:01,980
publisher tell me that they didn't want

00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:03,970
to do Django books because the the

00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:06,039
quality of the documentation meant that

00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:08,170
there was no market for paid Django

00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:11,109
content and I think you've all like

00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:14,079
proven that wrong but I'm interested in

00:38:11,109 --> 00:38:16,089
what your relationship is with the

00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,619
documentation I mean is the existence of

00:38:16,089 --> 00:38:19,900
all this great content to sign that the

00:38:17,619 --> 00:38:22,450
dot quality has slipped are we covering

00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,740
different areas what can you talk a

00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:27,009
little bit about how you see yourself

00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:31,240
versus what's in the official docs for

00:38:27,009 --> 00:38:34,329
me the Django docs and kind of need to

00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:37,240
be non opinionated you know they

00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:39,039
shouldn't be having favorite son and our

00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:42,130
book is a lot about the tooling that

00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:44,859
goes around Django so I felt like there

00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:47,259
was an opportunity to say you know sure

00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:49,000
there's other stuff out there but this

00:38:47,259 --> 00:38:51,160
is probably what you should be using or

00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:56,500
this is it this is a good starting point

00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:58,660
I think there are some easy kind of

00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,500
performance gotchas and Django that I

00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,980
don't know

00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:04,630
well they're documented maybe but I

00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:06,610
don't know if that's Django's job either

00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:07,900
you know that though RM can hide the

00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,490
fact that you're doing a bazillion

00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,710
queries and like that might be a problem

00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:16,030
or you're counting a table with millions

00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:17,620
of rows so yeah I think the Django

00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:19,570
documentation is great i think most of

00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:23,950
the content in my book wouldn't belong

00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:26,620
in the Django documentation I tried

00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:28,750
using polls way back in the day and it

00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:30,190
did it work and I ended up teaching

00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:32,680
myself Django using Kenneth loves

00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:36,430
getting sarjenka video series but yes is

00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:38,410
because genka polls that I wrote this my

00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:42,000
real quick comment is the Django docs

00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:44,950
cover what to do we cover how to do it

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,170
time for another question thank you for

00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:49,540
this nice panel my question is what

00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:51,520
tools do you recommend for your viewers

00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:55,390
in case of screencasts and readers in

00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:59,380
case of books for students and what is

00:39:55,390 --> 00:40:00,820
their text editors versus IDs trade-off

00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:06,280
for novice programmers from your

00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:10,390
perspective I don't think we have a lot

00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:13,600
of opinions about that I like dead tree

00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:16,240
copies I like physical books I also like

00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:19,270
and I was talking with someone else

00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,550
about this before I like not being able

00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:24,130
to copy and paste the code I like having

00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:27,010
to type it out myself I think there's

00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:28,840
something very that's part of my

00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:32,050
learning process I don't know if that's

00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:35,710
true of everyone else so I like having

00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:38,020
print editions and having to type and

00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:40,210
understand the code regardless of what

00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:45,660
the edger is not being able to copy and

00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:45,660
paste is like that's a feature to me I

00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:55,070
don't I don't have a real opinion so

00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:57,350
I I purposely don't have full projects

00:40:55,070 --> 00:41:00,020
on github like other people do because

00:40:57,350 --> 00:41:01,490
of exactly that I have just enough code

00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:04,550
in my show notes to show you exactly

00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:07,040
what i typed most of the time you can't

00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:09,500
copy and paste and make it work I i

00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:13,610
purposely did that because I'm that way

00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:16,010
I I I have to do it myself for me to

00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:17,960
learn and often it when I was when I

00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:19,490
experimented with giving full examples

00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,020
people would email me asking how stuff

00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:24,470
worked without watching the videos and

00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:26,360
so it's like I explained it in this

00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:29,090
five-minute video that I spent 30 hours

00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:30,560
producing why do I need to spend the

00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:34,880
next 30 minutes talking to you and the

00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:36,560
Cree explaining it so well did you have

00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,800
a quick question because and we've got

00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,780
one minute yeah I'm sure everyone's

00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:44,570
heard of Khan Academy and code Academy

00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:46,160
and just using technology as a way of

00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:49,130
teaching new things especially

00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:52,970
programming languages in Django do you

00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:55,790
feel that books as a medium have a much

00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:57,350
longer future for for learning different

00:41:55,790 --> 00:42:00,410
technologies or are they going to

00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:03,740
eventually be surpassed by screencasts

00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:06,109
or even interactive tutorials or or

00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:07,940
something else even from with books

00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:10,250
especially in my case is that Django

00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:12,220
keeps changing its version and so if you

00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:15,470
release a book and then Django changes

00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:17,300
then things got a date so that's the

00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:20,560
problem with say books over say

00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:22,369
tutorials well not is harder to update

00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,690
but you could you could make the

00:42:22,369 --> 00:42:25,250
argument that even if you're putting

00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:28,580
together screencast you're still locked

00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:31,580
into a version I've had actually uh so I

00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:35,060
Django classes startups corporate and

00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:37,940
I've had a lot of people in startups who

00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:42,380
say oh well I learned Python in code

00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:44,240
Academy and code Academy has a specific

00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:46,670
limitation where it puts all the code in

00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,280
the little box and then it doesn't let

00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:51,650
you out of that box and so one of the

00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,090
things about a lot of the I'm not saying

00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:55,609
this is a limitation of the medium but

00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:57,320
one of the things that you see on almost

00:42:55,609 --> 00:43:00,260
all of these sites is that they they've

00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:02,210
locked you in and that turns out to be a

00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:04,680
real problem

00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:07,380
whereas I don't think books or other

00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:09,180
mediums allow you to do that right that

00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:11,940
they give you all of the freedom without

00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:13,590
putting you in this box and they in some

00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,090
ways it's less great because they force

00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:17,720
you to go out and figure out the install

00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:19,950
and they put this overhead right away

00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,750
sorry it doesn't I way to end though

00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:26,300
because long live print is the takeaway

00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:26,300
