	Things That are Tired: Uggs, Segways and you! Coming Back from Burnout by Barbara Shaurette

Why is burnout such a bad thing?

When I see that question on paper, the answer seems obvious. But in nearly a decade in this community, I've seen people run themselves into the ground without realizing that they can - and should - take the time to rest. Why? Well, the short answer is that, if you don't take a break once in a while, the quality of your work suffers. But the long and more involved answer? Well, as a wise man once said,

"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it."
Burnout leads to exhaustion, and that leads to terrible performance. And no one wants to be known for performing terribly - we all have too much pride for that. History is full of examples of times when exhaustion led to disaster - remember the Exxon Valdez? Imagine your open source project taking a header like that. I'm actually going to get a little science-y here and cite a few studies, in particular a recent one from Washington State University that shows how sleep-deprived people have an impaired ability to take in new information.

Of course, you can get plenty of sleep and still be burned out. If your waking hours are consumed with community work, your relationships can suffer, and your sanity will erode pretty quickly.

After nearly a decade in the Python and Django communities, I've experienced periods of overwork that have made me hate everything I was doing. I have a lot of good anecdotes, stories that will probably sound familiar to everyone in the room. Luckily, I've also learned some tactics for stepping back and recovering. It can be done, and it's easier than people think. What you're going to hear from this talk is just plain common sense. But sometimes when you're mired in work with no obvious way out, you need to hear it from someone else. So I'm giving everyone permission to let go. (And no, I promise, there will be no 'Frozen' references in my slides.)

But how do you let go? And when?

Burnout is pretty easy to recognize if you know what to look for. Are you staying up every night reading pull requests ... and is that your primary method of interaction with other human beings? Your user group may only meet once a month, but is that group still responsible for the bulk of your email? Do you secretly blame them for your inability to get to inbox zero? Is the only travel you're doing for conferences? Have you given up on vacations and just decided to see the world one PyCon or DjangoCon at a time?

The biggest indicator of burnout in the community is how you feel about the community around you. When you find yourself starting to cringe every time you get a new Twitter follower, it may be time to start saying no to things.

The most important piece of advice I have is to stop looking at what other people are doing. We all know that person who seems to have a hand in every project, but you can't judge your own performance by what you imagine theirs to be. You don't know how they may be scrambling behind the scenes.

And remember that just because you're invited into a conversation doesn't mean that you have to contribute to it - sometimes listening is enough. Emails can sometimes go unanswered - so can phone calls! Think about what's most important in your life, and start directing your energy towards those things instead.

Don't write so much code in your free time. Take a few nights off, go outside - there's a lot to see out there!

Your collaborators WILL understand. Especially if you announce your intentions to the world. Send an email, tweet it out, let people know you need some time off. You'll be surprised how much understanding you'll get and how well people will respect your boundaries (you just need to set them).

so I'm actually really really glad that

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,080
this room is not super packed I was kind

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,460
of hoping that there wouldn't be a ton

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,570
of people or not not because I didn't

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,160
want to speak in front of a lot of

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,510
people but but I was thinking about this

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,880
you know I got such a positive response

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,470
the idea of this talk and it sort of

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,660
broke my heart to think that that many

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,420
people might really be that burned out

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,010
if I really need this so you know I'm

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,600
not a super experience speaker i really

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,739
hope that I can do this topic justice

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,390
because it seems like something that a

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:48,120
lot of people need to hear about the bad

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,340
news is that i'm not a self-help guru or

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,960
a motivational speaker licensed

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,550
close-ish and clinician any of those

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,010
things I don't really have any official

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:59,070
capacity to tell you how to relieve your

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,690
stress what I do have is some common

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,520
sense some stories a little bit of

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,850
advice from my own stories that I think

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,350
might help but I have this feeling you

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,299
know if you're here and you're already

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,670
identifying as being burned out you

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,700
probably already know what you need to

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,830
do to change that but sometimes it just

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,490
helps to hear it from someone else so I

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:23,100
hope that I can help you here at django

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,750
con you're already a part of a really

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,530
thriving community it's a very active

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,880
community you're already you know part

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,460
of open source so you used to give me

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,850
your time and energy very freely well

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:38,040
why why we do that is probably a topic

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,170
for another talk at another time I know

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,869
that most people that I know outside of

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,520
open source don't get it at all you know

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,860
we give all of our free time we work a

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,270
lot in our free time we you know there

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,680
was a tweet that I saw from PI Texas

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,180
this weekend about leaving you know to

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,340
go off on your labor day holiday weekend

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:57,299
to go and write more code that's what a

00:01:53,340 --> 00:02:00,090
lot of us do I maybe it so that you can

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,439
improve your programming skills or make

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,270
some new friends take part in this

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,189
community and meet really amazing people

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,899
there could be a lot of reasons maybe

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:08,399
you're just drawn by the energy and

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,190
excitement of all the knowledge share

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,930
that we do those reasons have really

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,700
been discussed and disguise

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,370
detected and you know I don't really

00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,810
know one thing that I do know is that we

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,609
all have this very common passion

00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,280
everyone's very excited and they love

00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:24,870
what they work on but that that passion

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,709
has to have limits I think we've all

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:31,139
discovered that at some point oh I'll

00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:33,389
start by telling my story a few years

00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:36,629
ago probably 34 years ago now i just

00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:38,430
moved to austin i started and finished

00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:40,079
one contract job and then started

00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,230
another permanent job i started a

00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:46,079
relationship i was blogging or trying to

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,180
you i had just begun doing young coders

00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:49,650
which is the kids Python Clouseau we

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,409
teach at Pikul and i started developing

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:55,230
that i was teaching beginner Python

00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:57,409
classes here on you know and all over at

00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:00,329
small conferences around the south I

00:02:57,409 --> 00:03:01,919
gotten involved the local CSTA that's

00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:03,389
computer science teachers of America I

00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,489
was volunteering with them to try and

00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:06,959
help you know work to improve local

00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:09,930
computer science teachers in class

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,959
record science classes in classrooms

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,939
here in Austin I was volunteering with a

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,599
local program Central Texas discover

00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:20,519
engineering that brings technologists

00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,169
into classrooms to speak and to teach

00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,959
and kind of get kids excited about stem

00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:26,459
so I spending a lot of time doing that

00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,290
in between all of those things I was

00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:29,370
doing some technical review had a couple

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,780
friends that we're doing python and

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,810
django books i would spend a lot of time

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,729
reading and i founded the pie ladies

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,709
chapter here so i was spending a lot of

00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:42,000
time doing meetups and classes to try

00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:43,739
and get that group growing so you can

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,659
imagine i was stretched to my limits

00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:47,790
pretty much i was really exhausted most

00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:49,439
of the time my relationships were

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,669
suffering a little bit my friends and

00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,979
relatives I was not seeing very much

00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:54,959
with them I started developing some

00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:58,079
health problems which I rule or going to

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,400
hear I was traveling sure but but the

00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:01,049
only travel that I was doing was for

00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,269
conferences I said joke that I was

00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:05,729
seeing the world one python and django

00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:09,900
con at a time and not much more than

00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:12,090
that I you know it started to take time

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,489
away from my actual job the the day job

00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:16,169
that pays the bills I was not getting to

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:19,799
do any of the things that I love outside

00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:21,120
of programming and you know so after a

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,889
while after a couple of years of this I

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,020
started to really dread every meet up

00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:26,700
every class oh my god it was like

00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,500
pulling teeth dragging me out

00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,500
meet up you know two three nights a week

00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,480
was awful you know in short I was really

00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,930
starting to hate my big open source life

00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,640
I was very involved and I didn't want to

00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:42,240
I really wanted to run away a lot of

00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,800
days so it took a couple of years of

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,710
this before I realized what I had to do

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,750
and that was just to scale back I handed

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,580
pie ladies over to some other very

00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,110
capable women here in Austin and and has

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,810
continued to grow to this day it's been

00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:57,720
really amazing I cut my teaching

00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,400
schedule back very dramatically I step

00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,350
back from all of that volunteering which

00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,330
was was heartbreaking was a real shame

00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,590
but I'm hopefully you know have been

00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:07,470
able to get some other people involved

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:10,080
in my stead and I I started saying no to

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:12,210
a lot of requests for my time and

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,740
eventually you know things got saying

00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:19,320
things calmed down and I was able to

00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:21,480
breathe again so we know that burnout

00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,630
really is a result of long-term

00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:26,790
exhaustion and everyone can have a busy

00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:28,140
day now and then or busy week I just

00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,240
when those weeks start turning into

00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,860
months and years and you're doing the

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,540
same thing and you're struggling to get

00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,570
it all done and you're taking on more

00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:38,220
over and over you know you're being

00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,660
spread too thin for too long and the

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,550
result starts to feel a lot like

00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,320
depression you start to dread what

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,790
you're doing it gets hard to get up out

00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,480
of bed some days knowing what you're

00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:50,310
going to be facing so it should surprise

00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,380
no one that that kind of thing can lead

00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,360
to really terrible performance but what

00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,480
I think a lot of people don't realize is

00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,340
what a serious health toll it can take

00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,770
every time I open a browser I see more

00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,660
news about new stories new new studies

00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:05,340
that are be doing being done about the

00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:09,180
effects of overwork on the brain and the

00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:11,130
body it's pretty scary stuff oh by the

00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,480
way the the links in this these slides

00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,520
I'm going to post these slides to my

00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,600
blog mechanical girl calm after this and

00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,010
they're going to be linked so you can

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,420
actually read some of these articles in

00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,650
depth take a look at these studies and

00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:25,770
see the kinds of things I'm talking

00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:28,050
about so when you're juggling your day

00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:29,550
job and your open source work and your

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,350
personal lives usually the first thing

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:35,040
that gets sacrificed to sleep I know

00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:36,540
that's true of me I was at one point

00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,289
sleeping maybe two or three hours a

00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,240
night of scary stuff

00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:43,999
so I wanted to talk about some of these

00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,830
articles that I found so this one up

00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:47,869
here this UC Berkeley the thing that was

00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,699
posted in this F is back in July this is

00:06:47,869 --> 00:06:51,649
actually a reference to the study over

00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:54,529
here from the journal of neuroscience is

00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:56,419
a very formal study conducted by UC

00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:58,729
Berkeley I just really loved the

00:06:56,419 --> 00:07:00,800
sensationalist headline you know when

00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:03,289
you're overtired you perceive friends as

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,449
enemies I kind of got me thinking I

00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:08,240
wonder if that's where flame wars come

00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:09,680
from people who love each other and

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,270
respect each other suddenly find

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,589
themselves at each other's throats when

00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,409
they're under the pressure of you know

00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:18,709
trying to get a pull request in and then

00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:20,689
also you guys know the xkcd cartoon I

00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:23,689
can't go to sleep yet someone's wrong on

00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:25,699
the Internet well what if they're not

00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:27,559
really that wrong what if they just seem

00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:32,119
wrong because you haven't gone to sleep

00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:34,610
yet so there's that and then this one

00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:36,289
over here this is an article from Mike

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,490
calm from last year this actually came

00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,770
accompanied with a really great

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,029
infographic it was too large to put

00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,469
inside here I think you would not have

00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:44,509
been able to read it even up on this big

00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:47,089
screen but I can give you some of the

00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:50,029
highlights sleep deprivation can lead to

00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:52,849
things like hallucinations cerebral

00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:54,800
shrinkage lost memories false memories

00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:58,009
of lost focus I think we're all pretty

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,449
familiar with that and you know

00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:03,499
ultimately brain damage is something

00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:04,699
that you can suffer from but one of the

00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:08,330
stories that really caught my eyes this

00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:11,509
last one here from NPR back in May it's

00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:13,729
actually a story about another sleep

00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:16,969
study that was done by the University of

00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:20,509
Washington what are the examples that

00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:22,610
they site is the exxon valdez crash now

00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:25,399
that happened back in nineteen ninety

00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,229
are sorry 1989's i realized some of you

00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:32,089
actually may be too young even remember

00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:34,130
what huge disaster that was by some

00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:36,319
estimates there were something like 40

00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,110
million gallons of oil spilled hundreds

00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:40,699
of thousands of animals were killed

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,439
including orcas there were a couple pods

00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:47,779
of orcas that were decimated there were

00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:50,329
seabirds seals sea otters i I

00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:51,529
deliberately did not get any photos from

00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,550
the disaster there just to

00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:54,500
heart-wrenching especially

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,970
you know if you're a hippie

00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,730
environmentalist like me I just couldn't

00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:00,800
do it these are very happy alive seals

00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:05,450
not covered in oil but in water I just

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:07,250
want to point that out but yeah I mean

00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:09,529
the fact is this disaster had a lasting

00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:11,839
impact on Prince William Sound 26 years

00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:14,290
later they are still thousands of

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,880
gallons of oil in the water in the sand

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:20,180
most of the animal populations have not

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,680
recovered there was an entire oyster bed

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,360
i think that was wiped out that has

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,570
started to come back but that's that's

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,640
about it and i remember you know i was

00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,899
in college in time i remember the rumor

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,970
that was going around was that the

00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:34,190
captain of the ship was drunk and that

00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:36,170
he ran the ship aground Oh came out

00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,329
later was that the captain wasn't even

00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,459
there he was not at the helm it was a

00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:44,450
third maid who had been up and working

00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:46,459
steadily for 18 hours at that point and

00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,769
and he was not the only one the crew was

00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:50,660
accustomed to that kind of sleep

00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:52,040
deprivation working 18-hour shifts and

00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,360
getting a couple of hours sleep and then

00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,970
going on again with no breaks no

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,670
weekends so they were pretty overworked

00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:02,420
and the result of that was this huge

00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:04,459
environmental disaster so it kind of

00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:06,410
made me wonder you know I know people

00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:08,390
who have stayed up as long as 18 hours

00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:10,370
hacking on a project it's not that in

00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,490
common especially you know when you're

00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:16,660
young and eager and new to the community

00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:18,920
and it made me wonder you know imagine

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,540
working for that long and that hard and

00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,550
being that tired and your open source

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,770
project crashing like that what a

00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,300
disaster that could be not on the same

00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:30,070
scale obviously I don't expect that you

00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:32,870
would kill an o but you know really

00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:35,209
giving your most tired self to a project

00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,350
is not good for that project the people

00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:38,240
that you're working with the people that

00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,490
are working around you deserve better

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,500
you deserve better your self care so

00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:45,560
much more important than getting that

00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:48,050
next line of code written you know

00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:50,060
sometimes you just need to step back and

00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,529
refresh and then come back to it with a

00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:54,680
new passion and you know if you're not

00:10:51,529 --> 00:11:02,600
going to do that for yourself please do

00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:04,089
it for the otters so this is if you take

00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,209
nothing else away from this talk

00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:07,379
remember this phrase this is

00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:10,019
probably the most important thing that I

00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:14,249
can tell you when it comes time to

00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:16,139
recover the first step is to simplify

00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:19,800
your life you need to spend some time

00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:22,199
thinking about what it is that you

00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,749
really want do some soul-searching make

00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:26,429
a list if you have to figure out what

00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:28,350
are the things that are really important

00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:31,290
to you what's fulfilling to you what's

00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:33,300
giving you joy what are you doing that

00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:35,220
is really bringing you fulfillment and

00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,839
you know if the answer is none of these

00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,819
things well maybe it's time to start

00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:40,499
jetta singh those things and look to

00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:43,309
something new or keep the one thing that

00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:45,600
you find that is really important to you

00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:47,429
when I was feeling burned out and I

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,079
needed to shed all of those projects the

00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:52,319
one thing that I held onto was young

00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:53,790
coders because you know I started out my

00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:55,829
career as a teacher and teaching kids

00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:57,509
and teaching them programming is the one

00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:58,619
thing that I love the best so that is

00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:01,379
the only thing that I do these days

00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:04,920
aside from occasionally speaking

00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:06,569
obviously um I you know I I focus on

00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,759
teaching and I developed curriculum and

00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:12,540
that's it I say no to everything else

00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:13,740
and oh and there's one thing that I want

00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,689
to point out to you another important

00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,850
point when you are evaluating what's

00:12:15,689 --> 00:12:20,459
important to you whatever you do please

00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:22,649
do not compare yourself to other people

00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:25,110
that you know in this community you know

00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:26,610
we all know someone who seems like they

00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,040
have a hand in every project they're

00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,779
doing all the things and you you can't

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,309
possibly know what they're going through

00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:33,749
behind the scenes you have no idea if

00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:36,269
they are fulfilled or if they're

00:12:33,749 --> 00:12:37,980
struggling so don't don't judge yourself

00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:40,740
by other people's contributions and

00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,749
other people's performance you know just

00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,519
focus on yourself and focus on what you

00:12:42,749 --> 00:12:49,079
want out of life and I think ultimately

00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:50,339
you'll be happy and then you know once

00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:52,019
you've made all those decisions and

00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:55,110
figure out what you want get ready to

00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:58,049
start practicing this phrase if you are

00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:00,589
overloaded and someone asks you to speak

00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:03,720
at a meetup you can always say no or

00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:06,540
actually better thanks but no be polite

00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,189
about it firm but play someone asked you

00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,439
to teach a class same thing you can say

00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:12,240
no then if people want to contribute to

00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:14,100
their project and I know this is hard

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,169
because everyone wants to be involved in

00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,360
these code projects but if you're

00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:21,290
overloaded you can say no and it's okay

00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,290
i'm giving you permission

00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:25,800
maybe you know maybe you're worried that

00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:28,830
someone might be upset if you say no and

00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,810
it's possible that can't happen but if

00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:32,220
they are you know anyone who's going to

00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,540
be angry at you for turning down an

00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,980
offer or saying no to something is

00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,890
someone that is not worth your time

00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:43,920
trust me on this I think your mom would

00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:46,709
agree with me and oh and you know

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,839
sometimes no just means not saying yes

00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:50,610
you know you don't have to respond to

00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:53,100
every letter or every tweet that comes

00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:54,690
your way every email sometimes just

00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,870
listening in on the conversation is

00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:59,010
enough you don't have to participate in

00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:01,459
fact you know this is something that I

00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:03,930
feel really strongly about I think that

00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:06,240
it took me a while to realize that any

00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:08,910
unsolicited email that I get really is

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,940
just a big ask for my time that I didn't

00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:13,080
agree to and it takes a lot of time you

00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,459
know we want to be generous we're

00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,839
conditioned to be generous with our time

00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:18,120
but really at the end of the day you

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,010
don't owe anything to anyone you don't

00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,310
have to answer that email if it wasn't

00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:25,560
something that you agreed to do but you

00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:27,750
know it note that I said unsolicited I

00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,520
mean if you're organizing an event or

00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,980
you're leading a project you've kind of

00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,170
implicitly signed up to deal with those

00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:37,140
things and so those in those emails that

00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:38,310
come your way they are for you but but

00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,420
that's something to keep in mind you

00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,279
know before you make your next

00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,540
commitment remember that those are the

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,190
kinds of things that you're going to be

00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,779
burdened with and so maybe you don't

00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:52,230
want to commit to that project or that

00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:56,160
event you know hmm just you know oh and

00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:57,600
also as I check my notes here um yeah

00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,640
you know saying no isn't a license to

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,820
flake either do the things that you say

00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:05,160
you'll do just as you go forward promise

00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:08,820
less commit less and you'll be a happier

00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:10,320
person I swear and those those people

00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,790
that all seem to be doing all of the

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,380
things there is one thing that you can

00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:18,089
learn from them they are very good at

00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:19,890
delegating and asking for help you know

00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:22,320
the irony is not lost on me that

00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:24,089
everyone here is at the start of a

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,610
conference start of django con you're

00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:28,110
going to be exposed to a lot of new

00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,610
ideas and projects and you're going to

00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:32,670
want to get involved in all of them

00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:33,580
because they're all really cool and you

00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,020
know you don't necessarily

00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:38,140
really have to say no to all of them

00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:40,570
just uh I think my best advice huge is

00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,280
to be judicious guard your time

00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:44,200
carefully be judicious with your

00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,270
commitments really evaluate whether or

00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,890
not this project is going to be

00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,360
something that you'll enjoy or that you

00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:52,740
can offer some something to you or that

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,850
will be good for you before you jump in

00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:57,130
you don't necessarily have to say no to

00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,390
things you know but you might have to

00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,190
relieve yourself of some

00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,800
responsibilities before you take on new

00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:04,450
ones and you'll have a couple examples

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,550
so the first step towards giving

00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:10,630
yourself a break might be just mentoring

00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:13,600
someone you so have a story over this

00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:14,800
past year I've been traveling a lot

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,900
doing a lot of conferences and I've

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,780
talked to lots of other women who are

00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:21,130
tech speakers and I found much to my

00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,810
horror that there are some of them that

00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:24,940
are traveling around the country

00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:27,130
breakneck speed doing as many as 15 to

00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:31,030
20 conferences a year that is no way to

00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:33,280
live but you know right now there's a

00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:34,630
big push in the community and all of

00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,100
open source really to increase the

00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:38,740
visibility of women and that's a very

00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:41,080
admirable thing the problem is that

00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:44,470
these these same 10 to 15 women cannot

00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:46,900
be doing all of these rocks so you know

00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,790
I think maybe we need to mentor some new

00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:51,070
ones do some teaching bring some people

00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,150
up and get more people involved and get

00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:56,040
more people talking about their

00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:58,300
experiences that are women specifically

00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:02,020
and then you know the same thing goes

00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:04,270
for that code library that some of you

00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:06,310
out there have been maintaining for many

00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:09,010
many years probably to the point that

00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,959
you are so tired of it and you cringe

00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,339
every time a pull request comes in and

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,199
maybe you're starting to really hate the

00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:16,920
language and you just are so sick of

00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:19,360
emailing people and talking about it but

00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,459
maybe you've convinced yourself that no

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:27,730
one else can do that job as well as you

00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:31,510
can well I have some news for you there

00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:33,190
are a lot of fresh faces and a lot of

00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:35,110
developers in our community who just

00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:36,850
really want a chance to stretch and grow

00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:39,490
and they just need that chance to get in

00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:41,080
there and get started you know what's

00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,300
old hat for you is going to be very

00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,680
exciting for them and they might make a

00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,080
few mistakes we might stumble a little

00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,440
bit but you know they'll be all the

00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,360
better

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,340
if you spend the time to mentor them so

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,649
reach out to your user groups reach out

00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,210
to mailing lists find people who might

00:17:53,649 --> 00:17:56,470
be interested in filling your shoes if

00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:59,740
it's something that you really want to

00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:05,080
get rid of bring some new blood in don't

00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:08,440
be afraid to do that you know and then

00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,419
hand the job over I think that once you

00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,620
let go of it the waste going to come off

00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:13,000
your shoulders you're going to be able

00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,440
to take a deep breath for the first time

00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,799
in a long time and it's going to feel

00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:22,539
really really good um no I have another

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,580
great anecdote here this is terrific so

00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:28,059
something to remember if you're the one

00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:30,279
asking for help over the summer I was at

00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:31,809
a party in brooklyn hanging out with

00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:33,039
some other developers it's pretty much

00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:35,559
the only people that I hang out with

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:37,149
these days it was a different community

00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:38,559
different language all together but I

00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:40,330
was spending some time with some other

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,730
people who are also very very

00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:44,500
sought-after speakers and they had some

00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,240
horror stories to tell me you know they

00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,799
get so many requests to come and speak

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,690
at these conferences that they've had to

00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:52,450
start making excuses they have to start

00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:54,220
lying about having personal commitments

00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:56,200
or you know a death in the family or

00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:59,679
something else that they have to do to

00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,929
avoid you know to avoid saying no

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:05,379
because just saying no has stopped being

00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:08,289
enough a plight thank you but no I just

00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:09,669
don't have the time it's not cutting it

00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:11,950
there are some organizers out there they

00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:13,779
can ask actively hostile and being like

00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:16,690
oh well so you'll do so and so's

00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:19,120
conference but not mine well you know

00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:20,470
and it just it drove me crazy I've never

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:25,120
experienced that I couldn't imagine

00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:26,649
someone being that mean but the point

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,019
that I want to make is that you know if

00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:31,179
you're that person doing the asking just

00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:34,059
be very careful that you don't cross

00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:36,340
over the line from being welcoming and

00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:38,529
encouraging into pressuring and and

00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:41,889
bullying in some cases don't do that

00:19:38,529 --> 00:19:43,149
please please don't be mean and you know

00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,559
by the same token if you find that

00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:47,409
you're in the position where you're

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,419
being pressured to contribute to talk or

00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:52,690
contribute to a project you can push

00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:55,779
back gently but firmly some people may

00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:58,140
not know that they're putting on that

00:19:55,779 --> 00:20:02,670
much pressure until you tell them

00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:04,020
so finally we get to the good part there

00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:06,570
are actually some things that you can

00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,850
say yes to once you're clear your plate

00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:10,890
there are a lot of things in life

00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:13,530
they're out there to enjoy you can go

00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:17,600
outside for example you know your inbox

00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:20,040
can wait oh no no sorry that outside

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:24,990
that's the one that you want it really

00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:26,580
is that beautiful sometimes you know the

00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,990
point is though that when you let go of

00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,790
all those things that are weighing you

00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:32,100
down you can go out and take on the

00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:34,050
things that you really love and this is

00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,310
just you know a quick sentence cloud

00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,810
that i put together with a handful of

00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,090
things that i enjoy doing that have

00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:41,340
nothing to do with code i'm sure you can

00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:45,720
think of hundreds more you know make a

00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:49,860
list and work towards that and then

00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:52,380
finally i know i know this is probably

00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:54,930
one of the most annoying acronyms in the

00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:57,330
history of humankind it's been used to

00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:59,630
justify a lot of obnoxious behavior and

00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:02,760
I felt really bad about including this

00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:04,920
but if you think about it there's a

00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:08,070
kernel of truth there you know you you

00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:11,630
only get one life and you really owe it

00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:11,630
to yourself to make the best of it and

00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:15,260
that is it

00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,490
