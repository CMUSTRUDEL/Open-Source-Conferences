Description: 
	Adding Geo into your Django by Corryn Smith

This presentation will teach the audience the basics of GIS and GeoDjango. Once you know how to set up a Django project, putting a map on your webpage hasn't been easier. During my talk, I will show you how to navigate through the GeoDjango documentation as well as other handy tools such as Mapbox and Leaflet. In addition, I will show the audience two GeoDjango examples â€“ a project about my Study Abroad trip and an interactive campus map! The overall objective is for the audience to know that GeoDjango exists, how to use it, and to promote creativity for their next project!

today I will be talking about how you

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:27,599
can add Gio to your jingo and first off

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,210
I want to apologize if my slides are

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,450
slightly askew I originally created my

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,059
powerpoint on an Ubuntu I transferred it

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,670
to a PC and I don't have a computer so

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:43,469
I'm using Anna's MacBook so it's touch

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:46,289
three OS you can follow along on a on

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:52,140
the PDF version you just have to go to

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:54,809
bitly /g o django 15 so give you a

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,379
little information about myself I will I

00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:01,289
will introduce you guys to what G is

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:03,539
maybe if you're not familiar with it how

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:06,150
G is in Python interact with each other

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,310
and then what geo Django is all about

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,320
and what you can do with it so my

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,840
overall objective is to introduce you

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,820
guys to what Gio Django is and hopefully

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,460
you guys can make your own project with

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,920
it so a little about a little bit about

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,280
myself I attended the University of

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,350
North Georgia from 2011 to 2014 I was

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,900
originally a computer science major I

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:31,020
took two classes intro to Jai thon and

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,030
Java I wasn't really feeling it I went

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,579
to a GIS day and they told me how you

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,619
can make maps analyze maps and even use

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,590
information technology to do more

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:41,909
through maps so I changed my major to

00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,310
environmental and spatial analysis where

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,740
I did my toes and remote sensing GIS

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,350
environmental studies Python Django

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,390
right now I currently live in Flagstaff

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,640
Arizona pursuing my master's in

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,149
geography I'm not really doing anything

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,759
with Django but I do plan on maybe

00:01:56,149 --> 00:02:01,860
making a project using Django and I

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,590
definitely want to spend more time free

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:09,959
time using Django

00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:12,480
so keep saying this what is G is well

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,310
GIS stands for geographic information

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,200
stumps some people may tell you it

00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,250
stands for science and boom I say it

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,790
stands for geographic information

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:23,090
studies um pretty much what a GIS is

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:26,099
it's a program that allows you to create

00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:28,620
manipulate analyze your geographic data

00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:31,110
so pretty much and you have a point on

00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:35,879
earth you can represent that point on a

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:38,579
GIS so just some applications of GIS um

00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:42,629
Starbucks may be the best or the worst

00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:45,569
at GIS every time I want to go Starbucks

00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:47,579
I cannot find one but if there is a

00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:52,410
Starbucks I guarantee you there are

00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:54,569
three in a half mile radius zip codes

00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:57,359
when you go to the department store you

00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:59,940
can create a map of trails or bikes or

00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:01,680
urban trail systems in your city if

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,620
anyone uses ways on their smartphone

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,230
that uses GIS so pretty much if you have

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,980
spatial data you can display it on a map

00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:13,560
and people love visuals i'm here's one

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,750
example just urban development over a

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,209
five year span in like gainesville

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:21,480
georgia a simple tracking map to track

00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:26,489
textbooks or you can make a map of your

00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:28,380
campus so why GIS in python well there's

00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,660
this one popular program called arcmap

00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:35,579
that's by ESRI that a lot of people in

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:40,079
the GIS field use Python is in stalled

00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:44,880
in arcmap and you can go into the Python

00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:48,120
in arcmap and write you can use it to

00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,340
automate your tools so you can write a

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:54,000
script here that runs like five tools

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:57,209
and you can have all of your stuff that

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,980
you want do you want to a project done

00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:00,359
really fast instead of manually clicking

00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,299
going through each tool on each

00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:08,459
shapefile or whatnot they use arc PI

00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:11,609
library to do that so what about GIS and

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:16,470
Jango well together they can make geo

00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:18,120
Jenko so first before you start your geo

00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,909
Django project you need to have a

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,219
spatial database I highly recommend

00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:24,389
using Postgres because you can create

00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:27,090
the extension

00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:29,939
G is to get all the special reference

00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:34,289
stuff you need to help store your GIS

00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:36,419
data so when you create your project you

00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:37,740
want to go into your settings folder and

00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:40,110
under your installed app you want to

00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,259
make sure that you have django dot

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:47,759
contrib dot GIS that's pretty much the

00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:49,800
only difference so now you want to have

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,830
your geo Django project right well you

00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:56,009
need spatial data to have a geo jenga

00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:59,009
project I highly recommend going to the

00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:00,810
geo Django tutorial they have the world

00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:03,090
border shapefile there for your

00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,610
convenience if you don't like real

00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:07,800
borders for some reason you can go off

00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:12,569
in the fancy internet and find other

00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:15,029
shape files for you non GIS people shape

00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:18,180
files normally are zipped and contain

00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:21,990
seven other files sometimes they have

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,310
four but it's it's four to seven files I

00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:28,529
can't tell you what they all stand for

00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:32,189
but dot prj means projection the DBF is

00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:33,659
the database and you just want to have

00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:36,949
everything's it you can't just pull out

00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:40,500
the dot SHP or it won't work

00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:42,870
if you have your own GIS on your

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,279
computer like arcmap or QGIS or grass

00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:48,899
you can create your own shape file there

00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:50,370
G is people so your model should pretty

00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:55,259
much duplicate what's in your shapefile

00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:57,960
the shapefile is pretty much a model you

00:05:55,259 --> 00:06:00,569
have all your different fields like the

00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,419
I have an example here like the name of

00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:06,569
the school how many students field for

00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:09,389
your longitude your latitude you want

00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:11,449
your model to pretty much be what's in

00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:15,810
your shapefile

00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:18,060
the image on the left is from the geujeo

00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:21,360
tutorial about the worlds the image on

00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:23,909
the right is my Georgia example here so

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,029
as you can notice on the top of the

00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:30,689
world border example it has Jango

00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:35,159
contrib dot GIS DB so you want to make

00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:37,440
sure you have that GIS so the Geo Jango

00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:39,330
tutorial is really great

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,960
but I think if you're new to geo Django

00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:45,510
it can be very intimidating it goes

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,720
through a lot of spatial queries that

00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:51,510
you can run and it's kind of fatty so

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,800
what I'm gonna go over is I'm cutting

00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:57,540
the fat for you guys so now that you

00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,060
have your spatial database and you have

00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:03,930
spatial data in a shapefile form you can

00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,400
now load your spatial data so this is

00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:09,240
what I did and I'm pretty sure the geo

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:12,570
Django tutorial does the same way I made

00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,730
a data folder in my app and I just

00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:17,160
pasted everything that was in my zip

00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:21,350
file so you can see all seven files are

00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:24,000
in there and then this low dot py is

00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:26,940
directly off in the jouging tutorial I

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,840
just changed the GA mapping fields to

00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:32,670
match my model and shape file and just

00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,680
change some of the names like GA shape

00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:37,320
set of worlds underscore border

00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,980
underscore shape underscore a string of

00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:44,430
numbers so then you want to open up your

00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:48,090
Python shell and import the load and

00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:49,620
then run the load dot py and as you can

00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,660
see it saved

00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:57,900
I believe there's ten schools that was

00:07:51,660 --> 00:08:00,630
in my Georgia shapefile so now let's go

00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:03,620
into our Django admin and you can see

00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:08,430
that the schools has Cecily loaded into

00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:10,110
my Django project you want to also go

00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:14,100
into your admin and make sure that it's

00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:17,040
geo friendly by adding the the dot GIS

00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:20,310
to your Django contrib and then with

00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:24,270
your admin dot site register I have this

00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:27,840
admin dot geo model admin so this is a

00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:29,850
very fancy thing that will add a map to

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,550
your admin and then you want to do the

00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:35,880
same thing with your your main URL stop

00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:39,320
py not your app project just make sure

00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:42,330
that it has the dot G is of course so

00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:46,470
let's say that I forgot to add a school

00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:47,160
and instead of going into my GIS my

00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,700
computer

00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,980
creating that second or my last school

00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:55,280
all reloading it I can go straight into

00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,420
the admin and go to add Georgia kind of

00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,760
like a look at you can do with a normal

00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:02,750
Django project but this time we have

00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:04,760
this fancy map in our admin so I have

00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,550
the name the school a used test State

00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:10,580
College University there's one student

00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:11,900
and then I placed a point in the middle

00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:16,490
of Lake Lanier because there's no school

00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:19,910
there this is kind of tricky the way

00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:22,100
that it's set up so you have to put a

00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:24,680
latitude and longitude number a string

00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:28,220
in your admin or else it'll be like

00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:30,940
can't do it got to fill me in so you put

00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:34,100
the point on the map you hit you got the

00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:37,940
put mumble jumble in the Latin long hit

00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:39,800
save and it will overwrite the strings

00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,200
that you put up there with the correct

00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:46,010
coordinates of the point that you put on

00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:48,590
the map now you can also do this the

00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:50,810
other way you can rig it where you can

00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:53,570
copy/paste your real Latin long and

00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:55,880
place a point in the ocean save it

00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,590
reload it and then it'll go to the point

00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,750
that you've had set your Latin log to

00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:02,030
but those are I think two or three other

00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:04,100
strings that got to put an admin but for

00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:08,780
the keeping it simple we're just gonna

00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:11,660
do it this way so as I mentioned it over

00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:14,630
the point on the map overrides the Latin

00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:16,550
long it automatically G finds that point

00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:19,520
on the earth in geocodes that location

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:22,370
same thing if you had a polygon you can

00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,710
just draw your polygon and it will find

00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:31,580
the geometry for that shape file or that

00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:33,890
file so I guess you can do this without

00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:36,770
having a shapefile to begin with you can

00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:40,130
just create a model and keep adding and

00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:41,990
adding and adding but you really should

00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:44,570
have a shapefile to begin with if you

00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,730
wanted to share that with GIS folk or if

00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:49,910
you wanted to bring your shapefile into

00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:52,160
arcmap or QGIS did you further analyst

00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:55,040
on it so I highly suggest having a

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,270
shapefile first but if for some reason

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,870
you forgot to add something you can

00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:01,910
always add it in so you want to display

00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,560
your spatial data right I highly suggest

00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,930
you create an ape

00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:09,500
so you can call your API is spatial data

00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:11,750
to your project so I'm not going to get

00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,640
into really big details it's simply

00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:16,490
setting up a normal API that you do with

00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,350
regular data I'm you just want to make

00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:21,649
sure that you have rest underscore

00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:24,519
framework underscore GIS and then import

00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:27,620
serializers as geo serializers and

00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:30,050
you'll have this geo field that's equal

00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:32,690
to m poly and then the fields that you

00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:36,709
want shown on your API such as name and

00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:40,990
number of students same thing it uses

00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:45,529
JSON data but called geo JSON data and

00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:47,959
same thing you just want to have it G is

00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:52,040
actually the way I'm looking at it it

00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:54,110
looks like a regular JSON setup so I

00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:58,339
don't even think you need add GIS

00:11:54,110 --> 00:12:00,589
anywhere and then you just want to make

00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:03,920
sure you have it on your URL API URLs

00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:07,459
and then voila I've pulled up my API and

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,190
you can see that under the geometry it

00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:12,050
has the point coordinates and it has my

00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:14,990
latitude and longitude of the schools

00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:18,589
that are called for my spatial data and

00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:20,839
then here's that test point that I made

00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:22,279
you can see that it's not one two three

00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:28,700
four five six seven eight it's actually

00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:33,790
me negative 83 and 34 so once you create

00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:37,130
an API you can use funk like third-party

00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:40,070
websites it is matte box to display your

00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:44,120
data on to your website matte box is

00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:46,459
free to use there is a paying option you

00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,130
can limit the size of your map and put

00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:51,920
constraints so if you want your user to

00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:53,420
only look a certain area they can't

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,740
scroll all the way to France or

00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:59,540
something like I said it's free and you

00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:03,170
just create the project

00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:05,870
you pretty much zoom into an area of

00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:09,680
interest so if you're interested in Cuba

00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:11,890
you just zoom in to Cuba and it saves it

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,079
there for you so when you open up your

00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,840
Django project it's saved on that one

00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:18,840
mats hi

00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:21,450
so once you save your project in matte

00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:24,030
box you just need to get the Mac ID

00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:27,450
that's underneath the project tab so

00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:31,670
that's really the only thing you need so

00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:34,200
now it's time to use the matte box API

00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:36,090
you just need to open up your template

00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,250
page that you're going to be using to

00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:39,750
display your spatial data and you just

00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,720
need these two lines right here

00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:45,720
one's the matte box JavaScript and once

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,940
the matte box CSS and I'm pretty sure

00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,430
the line of code is on the matte box

00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:55,380
website and then of course you just want

00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:57,540
to have your map CSS there and more map

00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:00,030
CSS I'm gonna point out that the

00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,700
variable our icon is going to be the

00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:05,700
icon that displays my spatial data on my

00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:08,640
map such as the school points so you can

00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:13,920
just mess around that and then

00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:16,860
underneath your CSS for your icon this

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:21,300
is where you want to put in your matte

00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:25,890
box map with your user name dot ID of

00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:27,990
that matte box tile underneath that this

00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:32,580
is where we get into the API that we

00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:36,000
created so it's the JSON and then we

00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:41,070
have our API name which was mine was say

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:46,440
does the API : Georgia and you want the

00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:48,540
Geo JSON pointing to your Georgia API so

00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:52,680
it knows what data to look for and

00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:55,260
display on the map if you're really into

00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:58,830
JavaScript I highly recommend looking at

00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:01,140
leaflet a lot of companies use leaflet

00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:04,740
to display their spatial data with their

00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:07,620
fancy movements or icons like you click

00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,030
on the point and it shows you my my

00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,590
sample would be like the name of the

00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:13,140
school the students you can have that

00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:14,730
hyperlink to another profile so if

00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:18,540
you're really into JavaScript I highly

00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:19,770
recommend looking at leaflet so this is

00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:22,710
the finished project this is what

00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:24,420
happens after I've load the data I added

00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:27,720
a point on the map because I forgot

00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:29,939
something I created my API and

00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:33,089
I went on Matt box and created a map

00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:35,250
tile and then put that into my template

00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:38,759
you can now see that there are schools

00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:39,660
on my Georgia matte box tile and if you

00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:42,000
look close enough

00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:45,180
there is the imaginary school that's on

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,100
an island in Lake Lanier and what I was

00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,779
mentioning before at the JavaScript you

00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,149
can tell that when you point or click on

00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:55,350
the point on the map it has the name of

00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:57,209
the school and amount of students so

00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:59,850
let's get fancy you want to create

00:15:57,209 --> 00:16:02,490
something interactive right so last

00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:04,589
semester in my webmaster class I teamed

00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,930
up with Crystal illest inand Wilcox and

00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:08,790
we kind of messed around and created an

00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,290
interactive campus map for the

00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:12,240
University of North Georgia Gainesville

00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,279
campus um feel free to go to this

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,899
website it's a warning you it's still in

00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:21,629
the works we only worked on it for one

00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:23,160
semester its ung map comm so if you're

00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:25,920
going to the website I recommend going

00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,740
to the Gainesville campus when you go to

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,139
the Gainesville campus it will display

00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,759
you our matte box tile of the ganges'

00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:34,170
looking at this school we have a

00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:37,259
restriction on it like I mentioned

00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:42,180
earlier you can't go normal two miles

00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:44,399
northwest east and south I'm just

00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,889
looking at this I don't know how well

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:50,250
you guys can see it but the parking lots

00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:55,230
are grayed out the buildings have 10 or

00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:57,899
nothing the buildings have red Shea file

00:16:55,230 --> 00:17:01,680
and then the emergency call boxes are

00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:05,159
blue points on the map you can use the

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:08,339
html5 geolocation to hit find me and it

00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:09,870
works very well on the cell phones I we

00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:11,339
tested out in the Science Building and

00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,839
it had me right on the corner of the

00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:19,829
science building where I was standing on

00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:22,949
the second level here's some zoomed in

00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:26,569
detail of our shape file I hand

00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:26,569
digitized all the parking lot spaces

00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:34,049
yeah there are a lot of them and you can

00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:37,880
keep zooming in so that's just an

00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:37,880
example of some shape files you can make

00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:44,610
so like I said my objective of this talk

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,820
was to introduce you guys to what Geo

00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:50,660
Jango is how you can use it and

00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:53,430
hopefully we can promote some more ideas

00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:55,950
maps are great I mean people love

00:17:53,430 --> 00:18:00,510
visuals if you have data that can be

00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:02,100
placed on a map put it on a map so if

00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:05,310
you have a figure out a problem and

00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:08,730
solve it with a map like I said maps

00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:10,920
were used everywhere I like to give a

00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:12,360
special thanks to my professor is Zach

00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,310
Miller from the University of North

00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,090
Georgia obviously I couldn't be here

00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,160
without him

00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:19,620
I've had him for three semesters and he

00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:22,950
does a lot with GIS and Django and geo

00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:24,630
Django one of the things brand and room

00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:26,700
Iser for setting up the Linux machine

00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:29,600
for me to make this PowerPoint

00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,740
presentation crystal and will for

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,130
teaming up with me to make our

00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:38,040
interactive web map and then Django con

00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:40,110
us the Django Software Foundation for

00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,640
letting me be here today because I

00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:44,970
literally moved across country from

00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,650
Atlanta to Flagstaff Arizona less or 3

00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,810
weeks ago and I wouldn't have been here

00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:53,540
without them and of course Ana for let

00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:55,860
me use her laptop for today's talk I

00:18:53,540 --> 00:19:00,630
will now take questions we have 10

00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:09,570
minutes left and your miser you're

00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:11,040
setting up a little hello I I wonder if

00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,990
there might be some time during the

00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:16,320
conference to just kind of sit down and

00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:19,230
do a little mini install a thon or

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,130
something like that - um if there's a

00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:24,120
time that people want to just try it

00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:26,690
unfortunately no I have class on

00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:29,310
Wednesday so I'm leaving tomorrow night

00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:33,210
we can maybe meet up sometime tomorrow

00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:35,820
and I can go over some of the stuff that

00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:38,790
you will need to install to get your geo

00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:40,680
Django up and running and I can point

00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:42,930
you to great references that I've used

00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:47,690
in the past do you want to pick the time

00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:47,690
in a place maybe where people can do it

00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:54,940
if you follow me on Twitter I'm sure I

00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:59,800
can pick up my busy schedule and I'm

00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:00,220
sorry know what I should do doll oh is

00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,580
it

00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:07,270
I haven't heard of that okay yeah I was

00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:08,650
actually wondering maybe but I was

00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:10,780
wondering how difficult it is to

00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:13,090
integrate this into an existing Django

00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,890
app or just to have a gen go up like

00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:16,660
maybe that's a little bit separate

00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,730
because I know this one or when I was

00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,930
looking at it I haven't used it at all

00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:23,080
but when I was looking at it you have to

00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:25,030
use a specific database engine for it

00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,680
so is there a way to just integrate it

00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:32,200
in without making that the default

00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:37,950
engine or you will need a spatial

00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,950
database to have this geo Django working

00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:49,720
are you using Postgres right now yeah

00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:52,330
yeah I I'm not positive but maybe you

00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:56,920
can try doing the create extension post

00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:59,830
GIS I'm not positive on how that's gonna

00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:04,870
work on your existing project I mean you

00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:08,020
can try it it may or may not work it

00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:10,480
shouldn't affect the project okay so

00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:12,070
there you go all right yeah like I

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,930
mentioned there's some points in the

00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:17,440
project that where you will need to add

00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:18,790
the dot GIS but it shouldn't hurt your

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,090
current project

00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:25,180
are there any handy references or

00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:28,270
resources online to be able to find data

00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:30,790
for particular problems okay where we

00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:35,380
can find spatial data all right

00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:37,690
the GIS Clearing House website has some

00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:40,870
data that we can use if you're into

00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:44,640
roads I highly recommend Tiger if you're

00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:48,580
into census data you want to go to NH in

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,200
hg is the national historic GIS they

00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:55,720
have all sorts of census data I think

00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:57,820
all the way into the 1800s trying to

00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,060
think of what other places we can get

00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:02,420
spatial data

00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:05,390
I mean if you just google something and

00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:08,390
put shapefile you might be lucky some

00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:14,950
companies have their GIS data open to

00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:19,490
the public if you can get data and an

00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:23,030
excel sheet you can put that into a CSV

00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:25,100
you can put that into your GIS such as

00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:27,800
arcmap and create a shapefile there and

00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:33,290
then put that onto your geo janggo web

00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:35,450
app so it's a multi-step process but if

00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:38,900
you have the data you can definitely put

00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:41,420
it on a map hello two questions one that

00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:44,090
admin weirdness I'm from a developer

00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:46,430
point perspective that just seems like

00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:48,710
it's screaming for a pull request is it

00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:50,480
just something that needs to be done you

00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:54,500
know where you enter gibberish and

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:57,530
lat/long and click the map um I think

00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:00,200
it's how the shapefile is set up because

00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:05,150
I you have to have the lat and long on

00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:06,520
your model for it to pull in your

00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:10,040
shapefile

00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:12,470
okay so seems like seems like something

00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:14,450
in the admin could be fixed well yeah I

00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:16,580
agree with you and I probably need to do

00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:19,370
more research to see if there is a way

00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:21,290
we can get that taken care of right

00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:22,970
because like I mentioned earlier I did

00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:25,940
another project where I had switched it

00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:29,030
I put in the coordinates and then put a

00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:31,010
gibberish joint on the map related I

00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:33,350
guess about the shapefile so you've got

00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:34,850
the loader for the shapefile to put all

00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:37,100
the stuff in the GIS database is there

00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:40,340
any way to with do django or some other

00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:41,840
extensions to write a shape file out as

00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:44,120
if you're adding more data into that

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,510
database can you yeah I guess the way

00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:51,680
that you can uphold the geo Jason

00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:54,080
information and you can I guess then

00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,090
write a program for it to maybe using

00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:02,470
arc PI to make a shapefile using the Geo

00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:02,470
