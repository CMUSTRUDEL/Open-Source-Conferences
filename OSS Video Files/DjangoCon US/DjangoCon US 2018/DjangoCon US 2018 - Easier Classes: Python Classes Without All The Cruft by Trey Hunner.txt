	DjangoCon US 2018 - Easier Classes: Python Classes Without All The Cruft by Trey Hunner

When bundling up data, sometimes tuples and dictionaries donâ€™t quite cut it. Pythonâ€™s classes are powerful tools for data storage and manipulation, but it can take quite a bit of boilerplate code to make a well-behaved Python class. In this talk weâ€™re going to discuss how a well-behaved class should work and take a look at a number of helper libraries for creating well-behaved classes.

Weâ€™ll first see how to make classes with proper string representations, comparability, iterability, and immutability. Then weâ€™ll dive into helper tools built-in to the standard library and available in third-party libraries and briefly discuss which of these tools makes sense to use with Djangoâ€™s classes.

Weâ€™ll look at namedtuple, NamedTuple (not a typo), attrs, and the new Python 3.7 dataclasses.

Most of the libraries discussed in this talk are only available in Python 3, so if youâ€™re not using Python 3, hopefully this talk will encourage you to upgrade.
