	DjangoCon US 2018 - Easier Classes: Python Classes Without All The Cruft by Trey Hunner

When bundling up data, sometimes tuples and dictionaries don’t quite cut it. Python’s classes are powerful tools for data storage and manipulation, but it can take quite a bit of boilerplate code to make a well-behaved Python class. In this talk we’re going to discuss how a well-behaved class should work and take a look at a number of helper libraries for creating well-behaved classes.

We’ll first see how to make classes with proper string representations, comparability, iterability, and immutability. Then we’ll dive into helper tools built-in to the standard library and available in third-party libraries and briefly discuss which of these tools makes sense to use with Django’s classes.

We’ll look at namedtuple, NamedTuple (not a typo), attrs, and the new Python 3.7 dataclasses.

Most of the libraries discussed in this talk are only available in Python 3, so if you’re not using Python 3, hopefully this talk will encourage you to upgrade.

00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:20,250
all right so we are going to be time

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,449
crunch so we're gonna get started I'm

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,970
not really gonna introduce myself

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,340
because I don't have time I will say

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,840
that I teach Python so I run a Python

00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,689
skill building service called Python

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,660
morsels I have stickers if you want one

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,040
find me afterward and I teach on-site

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,100
with companies I actually do Python and

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,379
Django training as well so that is me

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,800
we're going to talk about classes

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:46,079
I am very tempted to say that I'd like

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,629
to talk about pythonic classes but that

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,059
word pythonic is a little bit

00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:52,530
controversial or loaded and it's

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:54,210
definitely little bit overused so

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,020
instead I want to say that we're talking

00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:01,140
about friendly classes our goal is to

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,899
make classes that are friendlier for

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,040
other developers to use so friendly

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,290
classes have a nice string

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,070
representation and they can be compared

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,530
to each other in ways that make sense

00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:16,650
more than that even they can overload

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,330
operators so you can use plus/minus any

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,570
type of operators that make sense on

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,920
your class maybe iterability hash

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,150
ability there's a lot of stuff we could

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,700
implement in our class to make it

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,110
friendlier for other developers to use

00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,670
so the first example we're going to look

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,909
at we're gonna look at two examples here

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,009
first one's a month class we want this

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:37,950
class to accept attributes which means

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,630
we're going to need an initializer we

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,189
also want this class to have a helpful

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,310
string representation which means we

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:47,130
have to have a dunder repper dunder by

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,649
the way stands for double underscore and

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,320
these are essentially special methods

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,600
that allow us to communicate with Python

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,060
this is a contract we have with the

00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,369
Python interpreter if we want our class

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:03,899
to also be comparable using for example

00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:06,840
equality and inequality we're going to

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,789
need dunder EQ on our class now we don't

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,470
need dunder any we did in Python to

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,780
Python three you get that for free if

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,650
you've got a dunder Eq if we want to go

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,060
even further

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,430
though and not just have comparable

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,980
classes but classes that are sortable or

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,620
orderable we're going to need to

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,989
implement less than which means we need

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,700
to dunder LT method we also need greater

00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:27,959
than though that's gendered GT and

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,190
there's more than just less than and

00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,890
greater than there's less than an equal

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,769
to that's dunder le and greater than or

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,750
equal to is dunder GE so after all of

00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:39,000
this our class is going to be pretty big

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:43,650
and it's going to have a lot of code

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,390
duplication so all of these comparison

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,150
methods all these dunder methods here

00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,950
are pretty much the same method the only

00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:54,720
real difference between these methods is

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:57,239
the operator that they all use so there

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,129
is a helper in the Python standard

00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,480
library that will make this class a

00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:02,190
little bit shorter make it a little bit

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,620
easier for us to create this class it's

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,420
called total ordering it lives in the

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,549
func tools module it allows us to make

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,109
dunder EQ and dunder LT and it figures

00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:12,690
out the other ones from these it kind of

00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:14,970
extrapolates from those to figure out

00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,890
how to make those others for us so this

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:20,849
is much shorter than the class that we

00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:22,590
just had but there's still essentially a

00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:23,880
lot of boilerplate code in fact I would

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,950
argue this entire class is just

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,480
boilerplate code we don't really need to

00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,950
implement all this ourselves we could

00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,400
just copy-paste it from somewhere on the

00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,340
Internet

00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,510
so we're gonna take a look at how to

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,609
make this class a little bit better

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,319
before we do that I want to look at our

00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:40,049
second code example so we made a month

00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:41,730
class here I also want to make a point

00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:43,620
class so our points going to be a little

00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,949
bit different for month we want a three

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,599
dimensional point that will also have an

00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:50,669
initializer because we want to accept

00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:54,150
three arguments for our three dimensions

00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:55,560
there it will also be comparable well so

00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,169
it also has a nice string representation

00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,629
and its comparable so all three of those

00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:03,299
we had in our month but we don't want it

00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:05,190
to be orderable necessarily so we don't

00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:09,030
want our point to be orderable we do

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:10,859
though want to be able to you do this so

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,239
this is tuple unpacking or multiple

00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:18,090
assignment we want to be able to unpack

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:20,510
our point object into x y&z variables to

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:24,419
do this we need to make our class

00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:26,550
iterable to make our class iterable we

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:27,510
need to under eight or method so we can

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,640
actually make our

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:33,210
classes work kind of like this kind of

00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:35,910
like tuples - in Python if we wanted to

00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:38,310
we could also make our class immutable

00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:40,680
what immutable means is that if we try

00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:43,560
to assign to an attribute on our class

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,690
say px equals four we get an error so

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,980
we're setting our class in stone once

00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,230
we've created it we can't actually

00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:52,200
change those attributes once we've made

00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:53,940
our class for this this one's a little

00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,460
weird we need add under set adder which

00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,110
you pretty much never see and once we've

00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,340
made a dunder set adder we might decide

00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,910
sort of like if you give a mouse a

00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,090
cookie

00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:04,860
we need our class who also be hashable

00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:06,360
so we want our class to work as in

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,340
dictionary keys we wanted to work in

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,100
sets for that though we need a dunder

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,870
hash method so if we want a well-behaved

00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,730
point class something that works as you

00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,580
would expect it to if we were making a

00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:19,560
dream class ourselves this might be what

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,540
it would look like now the code for this

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,610
isn't actually that long at least for

00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:27,030
each method it's only a couple lines of

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:29,430
code this is still entirely boilerplate

00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,750
code though so some of this might be new

00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,520
to you especially if you're new to

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,890
Python for example that yields there

00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,690
that's a generator you can look up

00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:39,030
generators and iterators google that on

00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,770
your own later dunder set adder is kind

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,900
of weird hash is kind of weird a lot of

00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,970
these concepts are a little bit odd this

00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,100
is basically copy paste code time here

00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,570
we can take this from the internet copy

00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,910
paste it and we've made a class

00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,920
ourselves that does what we want which

00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,960
means this is all boilerplate code this

00:05:52,920 --> 00:06:00,390
is code that someone else could have

00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:02,730
created for us so there is fortunately a

00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:05,040
way to do this again using a tool in the

00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:07,650
standard library it can that can

00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:11,010
implement a lot of this for us it is

00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:15,000
called named tuple and it's built into

00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:17,730
Python 3 so named tuple lives in the

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,700
Taiping module to create a named tuple

00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:23,790
class you inherit from named tuple and

00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,590
then you use type hints to define the

00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:28,050
attributes that you want on your class

00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:30,030
what this does for us is it actually

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,790
makes a class that has an initializer

00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,230
automatically and it has a friendly

00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:38,100
string representation which is what

00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:41,150
we're looking for and this class as a

00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:43,620
bonus which is what we're looking for is

00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:47,160
comparable and in fact it's even

00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:49,080
immutable meaning if we try to assign to

00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,120
an attribute on our class we'll get an

00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,590
error by the way if you're a little bit

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,389
confused right now you're going what is

00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,009
this capital n capital T named tuple

00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:58,050
I've seen the lowercase version that

00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:59,580
existed in Python 2 that's in the

00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,930
collections module it still exists in

00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,030
Python 3 it's a little bit more awkward

00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:05,550
though if you're in Python 3 land this

00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:07,289
is what you should use so out of the box

00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,870
name tuple pretty much gives us what

00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:12,810
we're looking for in our point class at

00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:15,659
least but I don't think you should use

00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,789
named tuple to implement this point this

00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:19,889
looks cool but it's not actually what we

00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:21,449
want the reason for that are there are

00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:25,650
some quirks there's some downsides to

00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:29,009
named tuple so named tuples inherit from

00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:31,050
tuples meaning they inherit all of the

00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:33,690
functionality that tuples have within

00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,219
them so they can be ordered which is a

00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,630
little bit weird for our point we don't

00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:38,909
actually want our points to be audible

00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,469
you happen to be comparable less than on

00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:43,080
two points doesn't make so much sense

00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:44,280
though maybe they can also be added to

00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,599
each other which is actually kind of

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,000
nifty it seems like that would be a

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,560
helpful feature of our points but when

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,500
we add two points together we don't

00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,930
really get the thing we were looking for

00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,370
we get a tuple that well we get two

00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,169
tuples added together because named

00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,610
tuples are in fact two poles when you

00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:01,440
add two tuples together this is what

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,240
happens the same thing happens with

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,050
multiplication you can multiply tuples

00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,009
by numbers

00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:10,740
you just get a tuple back so named

00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:12,419
tuples are great but they're not always

00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,400
the thing you're looking for they also

00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:15,840
have a length maybe that makes sense for

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,380
a point it's sort of weird that it has a

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,880
length of three though name tuples are

00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,139
wonderful but they're not always the

00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,669
thing that you should use when you're

00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,900
using them you want to be careful you

00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,279
want to be careful to make sure the

00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,159
thing you're looking for is actually a

00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:30,810
tuple now we could actually get all of

00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:32,669
these features that we wanted without

00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,979
these features here we could remove

00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:36,570
these features by implementing a lot of

00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:39,479
methods that just raise exceptions this

00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:41,930
is really awkward though finding and

00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,490
removing features that you don't want is

00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:46,410
often harder than adding the features

00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:48,600
that you do want and that's the case

00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:50,190
with named tuples so don't use named

00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,079
tuple unless the thing you're actually

00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,579
trying to make should act like a tuple

00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:54,690
if you're not trying to make a tuple

00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:58,110
don't

00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:00,480
use name tuple so instead of name tuple

00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:03,600
we could use adders this is an

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,459
alternative this unfortunately is a

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,170
third-party library it's not built in

00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:09,029
the Python which means to get it we have

00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,579
to pip install it which isn't a big

00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:14,220
problem we can pip install adders after

00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:15,899
this we import adder we don't import

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:20,540
adders we import adder so we pip install

00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:24,000
adders we import adder to use it we use

00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:27,569
attrs which is a little bit cute but

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,269
also a little bit weird to decorate this

00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:31,949
class we set Auto at ribs equal to true

00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:34,189
so that we can use type hints which is

00:09:31,949 --> 00:09:36,449
just like our name tuple used there and

00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:37,769
after this we got pretty much the same

00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:40,050
thing that we get from named tuple we've

00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:43,470
got a class that has a a constructor an

00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:45,620
initializer automatically it has a nice

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,779
string representation and it's

00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,430
comparable I mean you can ask to adder

00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:53,730
objects here whether they're equal to

00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,139
each other unfortunately we can also use

00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,550
less than and greater than which was a

00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:58,019
little bit weird for point we want to

00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,550
figure out how to disable this feature

00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:03,240
here we don't want them to be orderable

00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:06,660
so if we want our point object to work

00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,670
the same way we had it before when we

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,319
made it manually we could do this with

00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:13,529
this code here so we're still using

00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:16,259
adders here but we've set frozen to true

00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:18,449
so our class can't be modified it's

00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:18,750
immutable now and we've made a dunder

00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:20,310
itter

00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,439
that we've made manually to make our

00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,029
class actually iterable kind of like our

00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:25,920
name tuple was and we've disabled

00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:28,019
comparisons unfortunately because we

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,880
disabled comparisons we did to make our

00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:32,550
own custom dunder EQ and we need to make

00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,019
our own custom dunder hash which at this

00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,279
point is starting to look like maybe we

00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:37,680
should just implement this class on our

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,540
own so the adders library it's more

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,610
powerful than name tuples and it's more

00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,970
flexible to name tuples but it can take

00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:46,470
a little bit of playing with to get it

00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:50,189
to do exactly what you're looking for

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:52,620
for the simple cases so adders in

00:10:50,189 --> 00:10:54,300
addition unfortunately it is a third

00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,160
party library we have two pip install it

00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,959
to use it there is actually though

00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,439
something that's included with Python

00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:04,079
that works like adders it is data

00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:05,550
classes so data classes are essentially

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,139
a simplified version of the adders

00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,040
library that's built into the Python

00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:10,560
standard library

00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,540
to use data classes you'll import data

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,370
class from data classes and you'll

00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:19,589
decorate your class the same way that

00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:21,899
you can with adders the syntax that this

00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:24,000
relies on here is again still type

00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:26,880
hinting so like adders like named tuple

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,310
we've got type hints there which makes

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,880
our class also have an initializer has a

00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:37,110
nice string representation and it can be

00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:38,459
compared using equals it gives us an

00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:41,310
error though which is what we're looking

00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:43,380
for when we use less than so it can't be

00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,819
ordered we'd have to turn that on and

00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,639
we'd have to do that ourselves if we

00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:49,800
want our point object to be ordered so

00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:51,480
this point object it looks close to what

00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,889
we're looking for but it isn't quite

00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,310
what we want yet

00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:58,860
if we're trying to use our point with

00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:00,810
multiple assignment for example we'll

00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:04,290
get an error because our point class

00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:07,380
here is not iterable so we can't unpack

00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:10,680
it into x y&z variables if we want to

00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:13,709
try to assign to the X attribute on our

00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,240
class it works which is actually a

00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:16,800
problem in our case because we wanted an

00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,779
error here we wanted our class to be

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,360
immutable so we're expecting get an

00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:23,639
error here and we don't we need to make

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,060
our point class iterable and immutable

00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:28,920
to do that with data classes we can

00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,510
implement a dunder ater method so this

00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,740
is not a data class specific thing we're

00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,300
just doing the same thing we were doing

00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,329
before and making a dunder inter method

00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,459
to make our class iterable meaning we

00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:40,019
can use multiple assignment so this code

00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:42,839
is the same code we wrote before that's

00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:44,430
self dot X self dot Y self dot Z we

00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,800
could have copy/paste to this we could

00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:50,220
instead copy-paste this

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:53,430
so data classes have an AZ tuple helper

00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,230
that allows us to get a tuple that

00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:57,290
contains the objects or rather the

00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,519
attributes that are on our data class

00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:01,500
object instead of specifying those

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,910
manually which isn't a huge helper but

00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,649
it is kind of nifty that means if you

00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:07,230
copy paste this code it's going to work

00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:11,040
in all data classes so our point class

00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:12,810
now is iterable meaning that we can use

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,579
multiple assignment which is great this

00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:18,149
is just what we're looking for it isn't

00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:19,470
yet immutable meaning we can assign two

00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:21,600
attributes and we don't get an error

00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,550
still so to make it immutable

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,730
we can set frozen to true so this is

00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:29,190
very similar to adders so when we

00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:34,590
decorate our class with frozen as true

00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:36,360
there we now can't assign to attributes

00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:39,450
in our class this is exactly what we're

00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,460
looking for so our class is now iterable

00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:43,730
it's immutable it's comparable it has a

00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:46,140
nice string representation it's not

00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,550
audible which is what we're looking for

00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,960
it doesn't have a length and it doesn't

00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:51,800
have all those other weird features that

00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:54,740
name tuples had that we didn't want so

00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:58,710
using data classes we have made a

00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:01,470
friendly class in less than 10 lines of

00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:03,600
Python code I think this is pretty cool

00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,530
data classes is doing a lot of work for

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,660
us here that we could have done

00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:09,150
ourselves but it's just doing a little

00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:11,700
bit of that work that we wouldn't have

00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:14,190
to do on our own now I said that data

00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,960
classes is built-in to the Python

00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:20,850
standard library what I meant by that is

00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:23,130
that it's built into Python 3.7 who is

00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:25,080
using Python 3.7 in production your

00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:26,880
production server okay that's like

00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:31,260
that's a good number of you that's about

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:33,270
20% I think maybe rounding up notice I'm

00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,930
I'm not raising my hand I'm not using

00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:38,820
Python 3.7 in production at the moment

00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,110
this fortunately is also available as a

00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,790
third-party library so you can actually

00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,440
pip install data classes to prepare

00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:47,490
yourself for that day that you upgrade

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,440
to Python 3.7 in Python 3 you can in

00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:51,360
Python - you cannot pip install data

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,670
classes if you need to support Python 2

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,620
I would recommend using adders it

00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,670
supports python 2 and python 3 even

00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,220
though it's a little bit more awkward

00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,960
for some cases and if you do need more

00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,550
features than data classes provide

00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,860
adders is a little bit more feature-rich

00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:06,480
in some ways a little bit more complex

00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,390
to use for the simple cases more

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,860
feature-rich in general though and data

00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:12,450
classes by the way was partially

00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:18,480
inspired by adders that's kind of the

00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:20,160
timeline that happened here so the thing

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,720
that I want to talk about next I don't

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,470
mean to be an infomercial for data

00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:28,050
classes but it's probably an infomercial

00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:30,150
for data classes so without any other

00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:32,790
customization data classes give us a

00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:34,320
good string representation they allow

00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,540
our objects to be compared to each other

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,580
we get an initial

00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,170
and that's pretty much what we get out

00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:43,050
of the box if we want to turn on other

00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:44,640
features we can do so so for example we

00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,880
just saw that we can use frozen equals

00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,930
true to make our data classes immutable

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,670
that also by the way makes our data

00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:52,529
classes hashable so if you wanted to use

00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:55,950
them as keys and dictionaries or in sets

00:15:52,529 --> 00:16:00,180
that's a nice side effect and it makes

00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:01,560
our data classes interval I mean we can

00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:04,430
if we wanted to use something besides

00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,360
sorry not interval intervals this one

00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,770
this would make our data classes

00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,510
interval here so that we could use it in

00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:12,210
multiple assignment but we can also as

00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,830
you see there with a tuple actually make

00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:17,250
these iterable in any other way we could

00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:19,050
use a list constructor for example so

00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,279
something I haven't shown you here we

00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:23,279
were talking about that month class

00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:24,779
earlier I kind of dropped that example I

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,810
want to go back to that for a moment

00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:30,720
because that required order ability so

00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:33,620
we can actually set order to true when

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,910
we're decorating our data class to get

00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,070
lexicographical ordering which sounds

00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:40,200
like a really fancy word but all it

00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,580
really means is the way that tuples

00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,440
lists and all the other orderable

00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:45,570
structures in Python by default are

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,850
ordered so they go the first thing first

00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:49,530
and then everything after that so if we

00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,850
want order ability on our class that's

00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:53,040
something we can turn on with data

00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:55,380
classes as well

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,720
one more thing I'd like to discuss that

00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,100
is not at all data class specific kind

00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,270
of like the fact that dunder itter

00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,470
is not actually data class specific is

00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:06,600
dunder methods dunder methods in general

00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,010
almost everything we've been doing in

00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,870
this talk is actually just dunder

00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:12,329
methods regardless of whether I've been

00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:14,339
writing dunder methods so one of the

00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:16,439
secrets really the main secret I think

00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:20,010
to making a friendly class in Python is

00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:22,560
embracing dunder methods this is a class

00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:26,189
here that implements dunder it ER dunder

00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:28,830
add and dunder sub dunder add and under

00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:31,200
sub what they give us are addition and

00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:32,850
subtraction the thing that that dunder

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,440
inter method gives us is well really

00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:36,720
nothing in our case outside of the class

00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,280
maybe depending on how we use it but it

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,080
makes that dunder out of the dunder sub

00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:44,280
the implementation a little bit easier

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:47,370
so sometimes you will hear people called

00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,110
dunder methods magic methods the reason

00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:51,540
I don't usually use this term is

00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:53,250
because magic methods are not magical

00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,200
they're not magical and they're not

00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:57,480
scary so I want you to to feel

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,850
comfortable embracing dundar methods in

00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:04,590
python dunder methods can make

00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:06,420
friendlier classes alright so before we

00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,910
wrap up I think we're actually doing ok

00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:12,210
on time which is surprising to me I

00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:16,170
would like you to consider whether you

00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:19,590
even need classes so this is a class

00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:23,549
that represents a matrix this class

00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:25,440
accepts a string that represents a

00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:28,260
matrix so it's got newline characters

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,950
and spaces and that represents a a

00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:34,080
matrix here rows and columns in a matrix

00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:36,330
when we construct this thing the object

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,750
we give at that matrix object has a Rose

00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:41,549
attribute that gives us the rows in our

00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,230
matrix in a columns attribute that gives

00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:48,690
us the columns in our matrix the

00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:52,799
transpose of this matrix this class does

00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:54,360
not need to exist I say that because you

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,460
could take this class and replace it

00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,590
with two functions you could make a

00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:01,919
matrix from string function and you can

00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:03,540
make a transpose function so that matrix

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,429
from string function when we call it we

00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:07,350
call it just the same way we constructed

00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:09,660
our matrix object before the thing it

00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:11,669
gives us back though is the same thing

00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,150
as a rows attribute gave us back on that

00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:16,350
matrix object the transpose function

00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:19,799
transposes our matrix which gives us the

00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:22,410
columns back so we've just taken what

00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:26,130
was a class and turned it into two

00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:28,230
functions you do not always need classes

00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:30,299
friendly classes are great but sometimes

00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:33,090
the friendliest classes just don't exist

00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:36,419
at all friendly functions are also a

00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:38,309
nice thing in Python so when making

00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:39,900
classes I'd like you to first consider

00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:42,150
whether we even need a class at all

00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,950
because often you don't there's a whole

00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:46,559
talk on this subject called stop writing

00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:49,980
classes it's a bit of an old talk it is

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:53,669
a Python 2 but it's entirely applicable

00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:56,549
rather to Python 3 if you do decide

00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:59,520
after watching that talk that you need a

00:19:56,549 --> 00:20:02,490
class I'd like you to make a friendly

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,399
class so

00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:09,059
friendly classes should feel as natural

00:20:05,399 --> 00:20:11,159
to use as the built-in objects within

00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:12,629
Python lists tuples all the things that

00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:15,200
are built into Python your class should

00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:17,639
feel as friendly and as natural as those

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,139
creating friendly classes can involve a

00:20:17,639 --> 00:20:20,399
lot of boilerplate code because really

00:20:19,139 --> 00:20:22,860
it involves writing a lot of dunder

00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:24,570
methods oftentimes data classes

00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,399
essentially help us write those dunder

00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,990
methods ourselves they give us those

00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:29,690
things for free without us having to go

00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:32,249
out of the way to write them

00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:34,619
unfortunately data classes are only in

00:20:32,249 --> 00:20:38,249
Python 3.7 you can pip install them if

00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:41,309
you're stuck on Python 2 right now you

00:20:38,249 --> 00:20:43,830
can use adders instead or if you need

00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:49,200
more features then data classes actually

00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:50,879
provide you can use adders I'm actually

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,159
doing really great on time so we might

00:20:50,879 --> 00:20:54,869
even have time for questions here I

00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:56,429
would love to help you improve your

00:20:54,869 --> 00:20:58,649
Python skills that's the thing that I do

00:20:56,429 --> 00:21:02,220
for a living feel free to find me in the

00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:03,749
hallway afterward if you'd like to chat

00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,119
about improving your Python skills or

00:21:03,749 --> 00:21:08,730
your team's Python skills or always feel

00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:10,230
free to send me an email if folks have

00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:11,820
questions I'd actually prefer to them

00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,820
the hallway afterwards just so we can

00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:16,289
kind of huddle around and chat about

00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:18,539
everything we've just seen here by the

00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:19,679
way these slides that I have there's a

00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:20,940
whole bunch of extra things in the

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,870
slides you can look into those on your

00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:29,779
own I'll tweet them afterward thank you

00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:31,840
[Applause]

00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:31,840
you
