	DjangoCon US 2018 - JavaScript for Python Developers by Å½an Anderle

Having a hard time keeping track of where the modern JavaScript is going? Are you familiar only with jQuery and you want to know more? Or maybe youâ€™re not familiar with JavaScript at all and want to learn it but you donâ€™t know where to start? Then this talk is for you!

Youâ€™ll learn about modern JavaScript from a perspective of a Python developer. By the end of the talk youâ€™ll know everything you need to know about the language, its ecosystem, and different tools and frameworks. Youâ€™ll be able to start using JavaScript more confidently and be familiar with different tools that are at your disposal.

Weâ€™ll go over all the things I wish Iâ€™d known when I first got started with JavaScript.:

Basics of the language (types, operators, data structures, functions, modules, etc. as seen in ES6) and how they are similar to or different from Python.
Overview of the commonly used development and build tools.
Overview of the popular frontend frameworks.
A look into the newest features of ES6 and Typescript.
How to get started and make sense of everything with so much going on.
