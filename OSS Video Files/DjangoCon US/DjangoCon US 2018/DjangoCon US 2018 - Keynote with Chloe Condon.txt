[Music]

00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:24,840
okay now we can get started so this is a

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:27,900
very very serious keynote as I've titled

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,609
it so hello everyone good morning I'm so

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,859
thrilled to be speaking today at django

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,930
con and thanks for rolling out of bed

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,579
early enough to catch my talk I attended

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,290
a lot of conferences and I miss the keno

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,480
a lot because I want to sleep in because

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,989
I'm kind of on vacation so you made it

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,399
congratulations I applaud you for being

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:47,579
here bright and early

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,500
alright let's go to the next slide all

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,289
right so before we get started a little

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,260
bit about me my name is Chloe Condon and

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,930
earlier this year I was named one of the

00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,760
200-plus thought leaders in crypto and

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,100
blockchain now if you read my speaker

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,320
bio before this talk this may be a

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,240
little confusing to you but I'm gonna

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,479
tell you a little story before we get

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,540
started here so I'm about to tell you a

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,820
very inspiring story because this is a

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,310
keynote and in a keynote you're supposed

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,500
to tell some moving story about how you

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,900
became who you are how to be a good

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,570
leader maybe announce a new product

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,600
feature so um I'm gonna put on my

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,820
keynote TED talk voice and I'm gonna

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,890
talk very slow I'm just kidding that

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,450
would be a very long keynote but I'm

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,060
gonna walk you through this inspiring

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:40,259
story and what I want you to walk away

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:42,299
from with this are seven easy steps that

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,110
I took in my career so let's let's dive

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:48,119
in shall we

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:51,299
all right so step one join a LinkedIn

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:53,549
group so in my experience LinkedIn is

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,110
mostly a tool used by recruiters hiring

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,000
managers when maybe we're getting ready

00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,219
for a phone screen looking up a

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,920
candidate maybe an older white

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,780
businessman random randomly adding me

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,750
for no apparent reason

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,810
but this began last year when a woman

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,370
reached out to me to speak to a group of

00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,810
women in crypto and blockchain about

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,440
being a woman in tech and what that

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,560
experience

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,720
was so I joined the private LinkedIn

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,520
group to get more info and the timing

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,670
didn't work out for the talk so I didn't

00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:27,840
really think much of it again so which

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:29,550
brings me to step two once I figure out

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,030
how to get through my slides alright

00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,030
here we go

00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:41,550
look I promise I've given talks before

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:44,280
you guys one step two is it's gonna be a

00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:47,090
really great step there we go alright

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,090
step two

00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:53,340
forget about it for six plus months did

00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,320
you know that linkedin has groups that's

00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,540
funny I totally forgot that they did -

00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:00,480
as someone who doesn't really frequent

00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,280
LinkedIn groups I totally forgot to

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,720
leave said women encrypted and

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,850
blockchain group as I do not work in

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,190
that industry so imagine my shock and

00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:11,430
confusion when I had 30-plus messages

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:14,400
connection requests Twitter follows from

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:17,070
DMS asking me someone who knows nothing

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,320
about crypto for advice on their crypto

00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:22,230
startup inquiring about consulting

00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:26,070
prices wanting to connect over our

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:30,050
shared love of Bitcoin very strange so

00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:32,880
step 3 don't learn anything about crypto

00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:34,709
so let me remind you that I know nothing

00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,440
about crypto and blockchain I work as a

00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:38,910
developer evangelist at sentry over an

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,180
open source error logging and reporting

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:43,980
tool I don't own Bitcoin the only

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,130
crypting that I'm familiar with is the

00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:49,410
Cryptkeeper so you may be thinking well

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:52,019
now is a good time to learn right no I

00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:54,230
have a lot of other stuff going on in my

00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:59,370
life and frankly I'm not interested so

00:03:54,230 --> 00:04:01,230
step 4 get copied and paste it into

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,870
several articles and continue to learn

00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:06,450
nothing about crypto and blockchain so

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,640
puzzled by this influx of messages I

00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:11,280
decided to Google my name and the words

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,570
crypto and blockchain and I got added to

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,040
an article titled 200 plus thought

00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,450
leaders in crypto and blockchain the

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,080
ultimate crypto list for event planners

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:26,210
influencers and the like this is an

00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,210
article that I now lovingly call

00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,400
200-plus thought leaders in crypto and

00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:31,990
blockchain the ultimate code copied and

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,130
pasted from a linkedin group i forgot

00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,770
existed

00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:38,770
uh-hum and thus began this lovely game

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:41,400
of telephone which was my crypto career

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:44,650
so step 5

00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:47,319
insist that you know nothing about it

00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:49,030
so soon my LinkedIn inbox looked a

00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:50,440
little bit like this I got some lovely

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,479
examples here for you

00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,860
so here's a good one I see that you're

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,650
in the blockchain space it would be

00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,870
great to connect I was pleased to see

00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,220
you liked our crypto and blockchain list

00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,660
I just want to connect with you in case

00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,020
you wanted to add or change your wiki

00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm in a wiki about blockchain okay cool

00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:11,289
um we are always looking for interesting

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,259
speakers in China and Germany happy to

00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:17,259
be connected and then here's here's

00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:21,789
another great one here oh if anybody's

00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:24,130
interested in property coin yeah so

00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:26,620
there's the I'm really not one that

00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:29,009
should be giving advice here so let's

00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:32,380
let's go to step six here so step six

00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:34,060
tweet about how ridiculous it is how

00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,490
little you know about it so trust me I

00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:39,669
was not giving out any vibes that I knew

00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:41,289
anything about this topic here's my

00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:44,430
favorite whoever signed me up for a

00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:46,330
blockchain email list I hate you

00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:49,719
adventures in crypto thought leadership

00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:51,880
continue this is still happening to me I

00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:53,020
don't understand why I'm not giving out

00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,960
any vibes

00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:58,330
step 7 put a line in your LinkedIn about

00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,539
how you literally know nothing about it

00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:03,340
so this is the kicker this was at the

00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:05,380
top of my LinkedIn for a very long time

00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:08,370
and I'd like to point out these two

00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:12,639
messages which I literally got last week

00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:14,800
so this is still happening to me this is

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:18,190
a true story I wish that it wasn't so

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:22,270
results the opportunities will roll in

00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:25,150
by the hundreds so this is this is all

00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:27,009
to say that I've added this you probably

00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:29,620
noticed if you had my speaker bio in

00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:31,389
February of 2018 she was named one of

00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,530
the 200-plus thought leaders in crypto

00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:34,030
and blockchain and she still knows

00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,279
absolutely nothing about crypto and

00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:39,520
blockchain seriously not a thing she

00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:41,990
considers it her greatest accomplishment

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,880
I'm speaking at a couple conferences

00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,620
this week and I think a new social media

00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,360
intern didn't pick up on the humor and

00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:52,190
said come join crypto and blockchain

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,690
influence I like please thank you that

00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:57,020
is the end of my talk I'm just kidding

00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,740
that's not the end of my talk but hi

00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,300
everyone

00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,610
since this talk is all about bringing

00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,320
comedy and humor into tech figured I'd

00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,110
start things out with one of my favorite

00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,550
stories of being a woman in tech and yes

00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,140
that is a true story that actually

00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:11,570
happened to me you can read more about

00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,310
it on my medium page with even more

00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:15,760
details about my journey

00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:18,050
hashtag journey into thought leadership

00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,150
so okay really

00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,890
who are you so hello my name is Chloe

00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,690
Condon I am NOT a thought leader in

00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:26,150
crypto and blockchain but here are a

00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:28,610
couple of things that I am so I'm a

00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:34,310
reporting tool

00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:36,950
I'm a writer if you're looking at me and

00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,320
thinking she looks familiar I'm the girl

00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:42,110
awkwardly standing with the thumbs up in

00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,310
the wine cave after a party for the what

00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,260
it's like to be a woman at a tech

00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:47,030

00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:10,899
Chloe and I'm a recovering actress all

00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:13,029
right so I have to come clean I wasn't

00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:15,069
always a quirky blond girl who wears

00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:16,839
bows in her hair and gives technical

00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:19,029
tutorials writes blogs does the

00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:22,300
occasional tech conference keynote in

00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:24,579
fact I was a quirky girl who wore bows

00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,740
in her hair and sported many wigs and

00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:28,240
did countless commercial auditions and

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,829
briefly worked as a children's birthday

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,040
party entertainer which is a whole other

00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:35,139
keynote that I should do so here's a

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,959
couple photos from my my previous life

00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:40,689
of being an actress Fiona and Shrek the

00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:43,420
musical this is a really bad Frank

00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:47,740
Sinatra musical I did once this is me as

00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:49,420
penny in Hairspray this is some men

00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,209
carrying me I don't know what show that

00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,980
was um and this is from How to Succeed

00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:57,569
in Business Without Really Trying which

00:09:53,980 --> 00:10:00,790
I feel like I live out every single day

00:09:57,569 --> 00:10:02,680
all right so but one thing has stayed

00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:04,449
constant in my life from those many

00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,850
years of being an entertainer something

00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:10,120
that I bring into all my work and that

00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:11,829
is wearing bows all the time actually

00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,589
it's comedy that's what the talks about

00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:17,110
but I do wear a lot of bows as

00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:18,730
illustrated in this photo so a little

00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:21,009
bit of background on me I'm a

00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,990
non-traditional background engineer both

00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:24,970
of my parents were artists my dad as a

00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:27,610
director playwright my mother was a

00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:30,220
costume designer and illustrator so

00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:32,199
growing up I was around computers and I

00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:35,380
was great at using them my dad brought

00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:37,809
home me a macintosh plus to do WordPress

00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,790
processing on it was super exciting we

00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:41,860
could type up stories and print them on

00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:44,380
those noisy machines or you to rip off

00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:47,019
the things on the side if you don't know

00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:49,569
what that is I feel very very old but

00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:51,069
this eventually transitioned me into

00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:54,550
learning what all the files and folders

00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:56,620
and programs did I learned a majority of

00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,630
my numbers in spelling from this game

00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,579
called the playroom I still have a lot

00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:01,959
of visual Association in my head with

00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:02,750
that although I didn't learn colors from

00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:05,030
it because it was black

00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,440
and white because it was the 90s but

00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:08,870
here's the thing my parents weren't able

00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,790
to teach me about computers beyond the

00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:13,340
basics I didn't know what an engineer

00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:15,020
was both of my parents were artists and

00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,540
when I asked my parents how computers

00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:19,700
were made I'm sure I got a brief answer

00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:22,070
and to be perfectly honest up until

00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:24,890
relatively recently maybe a couple years

00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:26,480
ago I thought that engineers wore lab

00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:28,900
coats and had hammers and were

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,060
physically putting computers together I

00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,690
didn't really have any exposure to this

00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,310
field

00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,540
there weren't any engineers in my life

00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:38,180
there certainly weren't any female

00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,920
engineers in my life and a lot of the

00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,510
media that I consumed didn't have

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,250
anything in that either so the fact that

00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:45,200
I'm here today speaking to you at a

00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:48,080
technical conference is in itself a

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:51,290
little bit of a miracle also shout out

00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:53,540
to Mario Paint from that last slide so I

00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:55,070
went into this profession feeder

00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,500
thinking it was something that I could

00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:59,660
support myself with and I was exposed to

00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,370
the creative world very early I saw

00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,860
death of a Salesman when I was 4 years

00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:06,500
old probably a little bit young to be

00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:08,839
seeing that I went to a performing arts

00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,490
high school I ended up getting my

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,280
theater degree from San Francisco State

00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:15,050
University and reality set in when I did

00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,570
Xanadu the musical which is this lovely

00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:19,640
rainbow photo over here

00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,980
I had a cardboard cutout of me and the

00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,750
lobby my picture was on buses people

00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,400
were tweeting me photos all the time and

00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,080
my picture in the paper and I thought

00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,700
I've made it this is it

00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:32,050
and then they handed me five hundred

00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:34,820
dollars for three months of my work the

00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,780
sad thing about theatre is no one sits

00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,250
you down while you're getting your

00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,960
four-year degree and asks you do you

00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:42,320
know how much money you're gonna make

00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:45,320
when you do this but I did have a very

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,490
long theatre career after college so it

00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,860
wasn't until I heard a talk at Google

00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:51,440
I'm about getting young women interested

00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,610
in programming and stem that I really

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,020
started to understand that this is

00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,910
something that I could do I of course

00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:58,730
googled girls who code I was not a girl

00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:00,260
I was a 25 year old woman and luckily I

00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:02,120
had started dating my boyfriend who is

00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:05,240
an Android developer started taking

00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:09,260
actually Kenneth's treehouse class on

00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,820
Python and I'm here today so if you're

00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,860
unfamiliar with what a boot camp is

00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:15,230
typically a 12-week program sometimes

00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,820
longer it's very intense you learn

00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,290
recursion in a day

00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,630
they don't call it a boot camp for

00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:22,250
nothing preparing for white boarding

00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:26,270
interviews for the first time is a lot

00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:28,850
like going into combat as we all know so

00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:31,190
shocking realizations when transitioning

00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:33,050
from theater to tech there's a lot of

00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,280
things that are drastically different

00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:36,620
when it comes to the theater world

00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:39,190
versus tech and as someone who performed

00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:42,680
in musicals from the tender age of four

00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:46,610
it's very much the opposite of Silicon

00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:48,590
Valley for one um the gender balance is

00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:50,540
completely opposite I have some really

00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:52,400
really great news for you dudes out

00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,580
there who want to start doing musicals

00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,380
if you can kind of carry a tune come on

00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:59,960
down to your local community theater or

00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:02,720
Broadway where there's about 40 to 50

00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:05,030
women auditioning for one role and the

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,530
four men who end up auditioning and a

00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:08,600
hobo from the street who wanders it in

00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:11,540
all get cast as all the male leads in

00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,880
the show so bundles of opportunity for

00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:16,640
you there if you're interested and

00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,260
because of this it's a lot less

00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,440
competitive

00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:23,240
so I went from someplace where thirty to

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,280
forty women were trying to get the same

00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,710
role to companies begging me to join

00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:30,680
their startup LinkedIn went from a very

00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:32,480
boring dormant place to an influx of

00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,490
messages but maybe that had something to

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,390
do with my crypto blockchain expertise

00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:41,240
so I'm not really sure um also people do

00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:43,250
not sing as much it's probably the

00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,020
biggest difference folks musical theatre

00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:47,000
definitely burst into song and dance

00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:50,390
numbers a lot if you've ever hung out

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:54,140
with them before um also I get paid a

00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:58,330
living away I get a job based on skill

00:14:54,140 --> 00:15:02,810
and not one of the following my weight

00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:04,970
my ethnicity my ability to tap-dance not

00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:08,180
having a believable Italian slash Bronx

00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:10,850
accent my parents donation to a theater

00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:14,990
having an affair with the director

00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:17,720
ability to belt a high C gender so sadly

00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:20,560
these are actual reasons why I was not

00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,910
given jobs as a musical theater actress

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,160
so it's a it's a completely different

00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:27,620
world I wish they were fake examples but

00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,820
they are real reasons but one of the

00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:33,150
things that was most striking

00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:36,420
was this meetups events content etc in

00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:39,240
tech were pretty boring it so I have to

00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:41,070
give a little bit of context here I have

00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,570
been fully immersed in the Performing

00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,070
Arts and spurs and you have to

00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:46,530
understand that until I became an

00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:48,750
engineer pretty much every single part

00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:51,120
of my life had some sort of element of

00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:53,850
entertainment in it even at family

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,040
dinners I would perform elaborate dinner

00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:58,740
theater for my parents up until age 12

00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,080
it was really embarrassing but even when

00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:04,020
it came to what I would consider boring

00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:08,490
or bad theater and there was at least

00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:10,770
some amount of fun comedy camp involved

00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:12,960
that's why we go to the theater right we

00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,820
go to be entertained so when I first

00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,010
started giving talks at conferences

00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,950
about two years ago I thought I was

00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:22,710
bombing I would throw in a bunch of

00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:25,080
gifts and jokes and puns I tell a lot of

00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:27,690
dad jokes I apologize in advance you've

00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,310
probably already heard a lot of them but

00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:31,080
they would my stick would always be kind

00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:32,850
of met with these blank expressions

00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:35,400
people on their phones the occasional

00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:38,340
sleeper I totally get it time zones are

00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,590
a beast but the one person who would

00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:43,470
keep me going would be the knotter has

00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:45,540
anybody given a Tech Talk before yeah

00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:47,610
there's always that like one glorious

00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,470
human who's paying attention they're

00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:55,520
like yes I agree and really thank you

00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:57,840
sir um so I really think that you know

00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,310
people come and see my talks and they're

00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,260
the quirkiest talks they've ever heard

00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,090
and I used to do musical theater I'm

00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,890
about as quirky as they come but shout

00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:07,860
out to the Natas you do God's work

00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:10,770
really keeping us alive up here so thank

00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,449
you so why do I have to give a

00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:14,400
disclaimer when I'm giving technical

00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:16,740
talks every time I give a talk I always

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,110
apologize and I go hey fYI I give a lot

00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,360
of dad jokes so why do I have to do this

00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:24,420
what is about what is it about tech

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,910
conferences meetups panels to like even

00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:29,630
online tutorials that have made us grown

00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:32,580
accustomed to this sort of monotonous

00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:34,800
monotonous speaker grainy footage cold

00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,260
pizza warm beer you know those meetups

00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,850
I'm talking about where the speaker is

00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,320
on stage giving the body language that

00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:42,090
they would literally rather be anywhere

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,990
else than in front of everyone in the

00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:44,280
room so

00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,870
of course I understand that musical

00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,150
theater is a completely different entity

00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:50,010
and it's not called the entertainment

00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,660
industry for nothing but even some of

00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,330
the worst shows I've seen and I have

00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:57,240
seen you guys I've seen some terrible

00:17:54,330 --> 00:18:01,500
shows in my 29 years on this earth I saw

00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:03,780
a one-man Christmas Carol one time but

00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,059
even that had some sort of entertaining

00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:10,380
element in it and I had no wine before

00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:14,550
that show so even if it was you know a

00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:17,460
grown man playing Scrooge to himself as

00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:20,400
Tiny Tim it was bad but like I'm talking

00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,900
about it now and we're all laughing and

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,300
I understand that these are two

00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:28,800
different mediums musical theater tack

00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:30,059
and it's it's something that I asked

00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,420
someone from the musical theater world

00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:34,470
Tech Talks felt a lot like Saturday

00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:37,200
Night Live

00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:39,330
a Saturday Night Live sketch that's Tim

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:48,870
Calhoun and I hope we have sound let's

00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:54,590
see there we go running for the office

00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:58,610
of president of America United States a

00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:58,610
lot of people are wondering

00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:14,750
well I want to tell you now who is Tim

00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:14,750
telling i dim Calhoun is leader

00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:53,390
confident economy answer strong of up

00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:53,390
here and muscles I'm Pro Isis

00:19:54,130 --> 00:20:15,310
where they're large cubes or small

00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:16,390
flakes I says keep my drinks Isis okay

00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:19,030
so that's a little bit of an

00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:21,640
exaggeration but it is drastically

00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:23,800
different from musicals also I would

00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,910
totally vote for a Tim Calhoun all right

00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,440
oh no we're not gonna play it again

00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:29,560
we're gonna go the next leg okay so

00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,720
obviously exaggeration but it was quite

00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,730
polarizing going from musical theater to

00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,440
tech talks and meetups so as a

00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:37,870
non-traditional background engineer I'm

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,570
a huge advocate for folks who come to

00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:42,370
technology by way of literally any other

00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:44,830
industry here's a couple of my faves

00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:47,020
this is my friend Robert he can't he was

00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:49,120
a horticulturist before he turned into

00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:51,310
an engineer my friend Catherine who's an

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,020
opera singer turned engineer she works

00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:55,120
at Apple now I highly recommend checking

00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,530
out her Ruby comp talk that's called

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,420
Mozart would have been an amazing

00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:01,360
programmer talking all about how music

00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:03,160
is very similar to programming this is

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,080
my friend Elaine she's a teacher turned

00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,600
to engineer she's also job searching so

00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,570
definitely hire her she's amazing and

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,160
this is my co-workers mentee from hack

00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:14,800
Wright who is a professional Muay Thai

00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,630
fighter before she turned engineers so

00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,850
there's so many different amazing ways

00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,540
that you can come into this industry but

00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,040
you get the point

00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,840
all of these wonderfully diverse

00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,670
perspectives from tech bring their

00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,100
previous lives into their tech careers

00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:30,040
and when I first began my journey into

00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,960
tech not blockchain and decided to

00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,270
attend hack write Academy I felt a lot

00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,460
of conflicting feelings about having a

00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:38,500
BA in drama from San Francisco State

00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:41,580
University I would have these fantasies

00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:43,810
about building a time machine and

00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:46,210
basically using all the money that I

00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:49,510
used towards my tuition to buy a house

00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:51,400
in the Bay Area in 2007 and then

00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:54,520
teaching myself how to code on Udacity

00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:57,040
while living off of free pizza at local

00:21:54,520 --> 00:22:00,360
meetups but alas I was 26 with the

00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:03,700
useless degree or so I thought

00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:06,340
so what do you do with the BA in drama

00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,370
if you are an Avenue Q fan you're

00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:10,580
singing the song in your head

00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:12,020
right now so two years ago I felt very

00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,360
very different about my four year

00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:16,610
theatre degree than I do now I'm sure I

00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,590
took a lot of very bizarre classes where

00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:23,180
we did an improvised musical about a

00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:26,360
skeleton woman I was in a musical about

00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:31,340
playing chess in the Cold War that's a

00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:33,380
real show um that played on Broadway and

00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:35,180
who could forget when my dad came all

00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:37,910
the way from Sacramento to see me play

00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:41,900
young number one in the first

00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:45,220
stage musical but I did however those

00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:47,540
four years taught me that's me right

00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:50,090
those four years taught me a lot of

00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:51,530
things that I use on a daily basis as an

00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,030
engineer that many folks with

00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:55,580
traditional computer science degrees

00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:57,950
haven't been exposed to um so when I was

00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:01,880
an actress I was typically cast as one

00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:03,980
of two types on shnu or the quirky

00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,540
sidekick so here's a picture of being in

00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,280
aunjanue if you're unfamiliar with these

00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:09,429
terms and aunjanue would be sort of a

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,870
disney princess love interest type

00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:13,660
whereas a quirky sidekick would be

00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:16,040
something like donkey from Shrek

00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:18,080
which is ironic sigh played Fiona but

00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,240
she's sort of an amalgamation of both of

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,950
those people so while the aunjanue is

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,480
typically the leading role and the

00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:26,120
romantic love interest I always

00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:28,700
preferred playing the quirky sidekick I

00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,980
love to make people laugh I love the

00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:34,340
science of perfecting a joke the whole

00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:36,980
rule of three I love figuring out the

00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:39,230
just the perfect phrasing timing facial

00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:41,480
expressions body language that really go

00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:43,190
into making it land and playing penny in

00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,200
Hairspray was some of the most fun that

00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:47,570
I had on stage for two hours I got to

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,000
wear amazing wigs we've really weird

00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:51,559
make people crack up and to me there's

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,710
no better feeling than making people

00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:57,110
laugh it's truly my drug of choice um

00:23:54,710 --> 00:24:00,500
and giving tech talks is about as close

00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:02,720
as I get to performing these days other

00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,710
than the occasional karaoke session that

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,600
they have at an after-party

00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:07,700
so naturally once I began to give

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,070
technical talks I wasn't sure how my

00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:12,530
sense of humor would land with a mostly

00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:14,660
white male 30-something crowd wearing

00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:16,700
Patagonia vests I'll let you read this

00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:19,520
real quick this is one of my faves

00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,950
it says Devon Dinkelman grew up in our

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,230
staff lives in West Village

00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:25,120
started an app company called Chadli was

00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:27,430
Evan Spiegel 's fraternity brother has

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,850
11 pairs of all birds stoked because he

00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:32,350
just crushed 28 days of keto diet this

00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:33,580
is my boyfriend and that's not a picture

00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:37,510
of my boyfriend but my boyfriend did all

00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:39,910
those things I mentioned before I

00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:42,010
started given preface it all my talks

00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:43,900
and giving people permission to laugh

00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:45,640
and after I seen success with this

00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,530
approach I began to change my approach

00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:50,140
to not only writing talks but also

00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:52,060
creating content building developer

00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:54,130
communities establishing my personal

00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:56,440
brand and short I just really wanted to

00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:58,270
make people laugh and also this is the

00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,730
Instagram account that this came from

00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:04,630
gonna give you a second to follow it it

00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:05,800
is a really really great content all

00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:08,190
right now for something completely

00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,190
different

00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:23,309
[Music]

00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:25,899
all right it's gonna stop I promise

00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:27,610
mind-numbing so guess what there's

00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,990
science behind this so I used to do

00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:31,119
children's theater back in the day let's

00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:33,360
me the yellow yellow cram I'm very

00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:37,389
diverse I played yellow and blue crayon

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,850
and I found that doing these shows I

00:25:37,389 --> 00:25:43,269
would be exhausted afterwards there was

00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:46,179
not enough Red Bull in the world to keep

00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:50,409
up the energy needed to keep children

00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:51,669
ages 5 to 7 engaged for an hour and if

00:25:50,409 --> 00:25:53,019
you've ever attended a children's

00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:54,460
theater show or even watched a

00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:56,110
television program I'm sure we've all

00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,940
seen at least a clip of Sesame Street

00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:00,730
you'll notice there's a lot of color

00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:03,100
movement songs jokes it's a total

00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:06,369
sensory experience and this is on

00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:09,100
purpose why because children ages 5 to 6

00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:10,990
years old typically can only attend to

00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:14,379
one activity that is of interest of them

00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:15,999
for around 10 to 15 minutes and they

00:26:14,379 --> 00:26:18,070
generally should be able to like filter

00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:20,559
out different distractions but 10 to 15

00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:23,019
minutes is the limit I'm also willing to

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:25,539
admit that adults probably even have a

00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:27,850
shorter attention span we're all

00:26:25,539 --> 00:26:29,769
addicted to our phones and about 10

00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:34,650
minutes into an OPR meeting we're all

00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:35,909
itchy to check our phones am i right so

00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:40,059
[Music]

00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:42,580
and that is why memory hooks are so so

00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:44,110
so important making people laugh is one

00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:46,529
of the fastest ways to break down

00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:49,419
barriers and winning people's good well

00:26:46,529 --> 00:26:51,850
now a memory look doesn't have to be

00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:52,629
funny it to be memorable they can be

00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:55,210
emotional

00:26:52,629 --> 00:26:57,190
you can think Don Draper in Mad Men or

00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:58,720
you can think of any Apple Keynote that

00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,580
you've heard where they talk very slowly

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,769
and talk about how their product has

00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,600
changed the world but memory hooks have

00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:06,129
many forms and I encourage you to do

00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:09,419
your own research on this but this talk

00:27:06,129 --> 00:27:12,639
is obviously about humor

00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:14,499
alright so content it doesn't have to be

00:27:12,639 --> 00:27:16,119
boring so someone who does this really

00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:18,549
well is the company that I work at

00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:20,110
Sanchi oh and in particular my coworker

00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:22,029
Richard who is in charge of all our

00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:23,860
content and one of the reasons that I

00:27:22,029 --> 00:27:26,039
decided to join the centry team was

00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:30,609
actually this statement on our website

00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:32,619
your is broken it just is how it

00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:33,360
developer talks like when you're out on

00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:35,370
the conference

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,830
fluor none of us are talking like the

00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:39,120
pamphlets or the you know technical

00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:42,480
things that we see that are very

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,130
corporate on these websites also I'm

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:49,070
going to just minimize this real quick

00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:51,870
and show you our careers page the magic

00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:54,540
okay there we go so this is our careers

00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:55,950
page at sentry audio and you see they've

00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,750
got kind of this typical stock footage

00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:59,760
thing and then she closes the door and

00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:03,540
you're like oh it's a little man on the

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:06,059
table what's going on here so it's it's

00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:08,100
really fun um you scroll down here we've

00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:09,720
got all these gifts I think under our

00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:13,290
benefits we say that we have unlimited

00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:16,830
lacroix cuz that's that's what everybody

00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:19,710
wants here so um and every employee who

00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:24,049
starts out at sentry gets a welcome gift

00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:27,660
which I have some examples of here we go

00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:29,520
so we make a welcome blog post and gift

00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:34,010
for every single person who joins our

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:38,490
team this is Aaron I sit next to her she

00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:40,230
loves Donuts here's another one

00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:43,020
that's one of my favorites so as you

00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:47,549
know we are a bug reporting tool so

00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:51,000
here's Lauren gonna catch some bug's a

00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:52,740
wild ivenna not appeared good sentry

00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,390
I just have to shout out to Richard here

00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:58,080
cuz I saw him working at this on his

00:28:54,390 --> 00:29:01,350
desk for about two weeks Lauren used

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,880
releases it's and it's in real time -

00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:04,440
we've all played pokemon we know how

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:12,990
long it takes to get an exception was

00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:16,380
god yes yes yes and then one of my

00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:19,500
favorites this is a shout out to 80s

00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,960
films this is our PM sarah trying on

00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,340
different outfits um so this is actually

00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,559
something that wanted me to work for

00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:27,950
this company um I was so used to seeing

00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:30,809
the careers page and having it be so

00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:33,360
boring and these looked like people that

00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:35,760
I wanted to work with because I like

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,679
having fun at work

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,450
and this is way more memorable um so

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,919
this is a memory hook and as tech

00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:43,320
company is having a sense of humor and

00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:45,990
branding does it not only humanizes our

00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,410
product but it gives a sense of it

00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:49,480
humanizes the working environment

00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:51,880
by the way sentry is hiring um hit me up

00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,790
afterwards if you want a job you do get

00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:58,150
a welcome gift if you come work for us

00:29:53,790 --> 00:30:00,430
alright next slide oops I started the

00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:01,690
video there we go so content um so in

00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:03,520
addition to our careers page Century

00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:05,170
also has some quirky and fun content I

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,330
created a series called exception

00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:09,130
perceptions which is a technical series

00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:11,200
where we answer engineering questions

00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:13,240
about error reporting and beyond we do

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,620
some shows with other engineers and

00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,270
other companies and these are

00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:18,040
five-minute videos notice that there are

00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:19,810
five minutes because we want to keep

00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,760
that short attention span of our viewers

00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:23,230
where we dive into technical concepts

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,540
but also have fun

00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:27,130
for example Richard and I created a

00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:29,680
two-part series that I'll show you a

00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:32,170
little clip from that was um episodes 1

00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:37,780
& 2 of Star Wars but good not the bad

00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:39,310
Star Wars let's see if I can this might

00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:42,010
not look but you can look at it on your

00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:51,400
own if you'd like let that load for a

00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:53,140
second the beauty of Technology you can

00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:55,450
check those out there they're sentry

00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:57,790
audio / tutorials and you don't have to

00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:59,170
work at a quirky small startup to do

00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,210
this even larger companies like

00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:03,070
Microsoft have joined in doing the kind

00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:05,110
of joined the comedy train so to speak

00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:06,820
so this is a clip from the open source

00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:09,010
show that they just started me and

00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:10,690
Bridgette Krumholtz talking about here's

00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:12,820
like the ability to do that which

00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:15,970
developer tools so yeah they probably do

00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:18,700
they may not want to like they may not

00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:20,920
be super interested in debugging your

00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:23,800
tool for you because they are trying to

00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:25,990
use tools to get their work done exactly

00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,840
and for example I'm very visual person

00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:31,990
so I'll show you in this handy demo that

00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:34,000
I prepared so as you can see this is not

00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:35,920
a realistic application it's built to

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,090
throw errors which we probably wouldn't

00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,460
build something like this in the real

00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:41,560
world but I can kind of demonstrate what

00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:43,960
this would look like so it's a simple

00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:47,170
voting application a normal working app

00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,910
I should also note that the reason that

00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:50,860
this is not on a green screen is because

00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:56,110
Bridget's hair is green so and we

00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:57,550
couldn't dream of this so it century we

00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:59,320
also did this with our meetup we wanted

00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:00,940
a monthly meetup that would engage at

00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,970
the community create brand awareness

00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:05,740
and be authentic to the century brand so

00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:09,100
we created something called sentry

00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:12,070
Scouts which is my brainchild which is a

00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:13,540
camp themed Meetup and we also made a

00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,350
commercial for it which I will play for

00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:18,160
you right now

00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:26,650
if it'll load perhaps I will refresh it

00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:30,130
a hard refresh all right cool and then

00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:33,700
before the meetup even started they ran

00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:36,880
out of pizza and he started to do a live

00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:43,720
demo of his product and the Wi-Fi

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:44,290
wouldn't work sorry didn't mean to scare

00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,940
you

00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:47,530
we're just talking about old few tips

00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,060
that we've been to the past pretty

00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:51,160
spooky am i right

00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:53,500
we've all been there before meet ups

00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:56,740
with the same cold keep the boring

00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:58,120
speakers weird topics let's be real

00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,520
we're really there for the good

00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:03,660
conversation meet me a couple free beers

00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,660
but I digress

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,670
but what if there was a meet-up that was

00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:12,380
fun more talking less listening one with

00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:13,520
diverse speakers from all kinds of

00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:18,280
backgrounds to help kick off the

00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:18,280
conversation that's looking great y'all

00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:22,830
and just for fun what if we threw some

00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:25,289
camp food at the mix don't forget the

00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:30,150
busy hot chocolate oh no I couldn't I'm

00:33:25,289 --> 00:33:31,799
working thank you and just for fun what

00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:35,280
if we threw some patches in the mix

00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:36,630
that's right patches will have limited

00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,510
edition patches and stickers

00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:41,280
commemorating each meter and yes if you

00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:44,780
collect them all we totally have a

00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,780
surprise for you at the end of the year

00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:49,530
look we know you can go to a meet-up any

00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,690
night of the week enough stop and we're

00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:55,250
here to make them a fun open engaging

00:33:51,690 --> 00:34:00,179
discussion with a campy theme get it

00:33:55,250 --> 00:34:02,010
nailed it nice our promise to you

00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:04,140
we'll never pitch you feed you cold

00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:06,030
pizza make you sell Girl Scout cookies

00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,690
or make you bored so what are you

00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,159
waiting for

00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:11,820
come and join sentry Scouts made up

00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,470
today all right so that's our commercial

00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:15,270
we actually find that a lot of people

00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:18,599
find us through our commercial or

00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:21,240
through word-of-mouth um which is really

00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:23,129
cool um so it's not your typical monthly

00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:25,710
meetup and yes we do have patches and

00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:26,970
stickers for each event so when we were

00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:28,800
kind of drafting this out we're thinking

00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:31,050
of the average meetup you arrive grab

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,899
pizza maybe a warm beer chat with other

00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:35,490
attendees sit down here someone usually

00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:38,220
recruiter talk about how they're hiring

00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:40,530
blah glance first speaker comes up

00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:42,389
usually always male shamelessly plug

00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:44,820
this company tries to do a demo the

00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:47,280
Wi-Fi doesn't work second speaker is

00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,929
very nervous Wi-Fi is still shitty you

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,520
start to look at your phone you kind of

00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:53,070
tune out start questioning why you're

00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:55,050
here on a Wednesday night you slither

00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:57,149
out as soon as you can the event ran 45

00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:59,430
minutes over and then four century

00:34:57,149 --> 00:35:01,380
scouts we wanted it to be different we

00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:03,180
wanted you to arrive take pictures with

00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:05,730
the giant squirrel in front of a tent

00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:08,040
you also asked someone to take a pic of

00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:10,200
you in our giant camp chair you chat

00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,060
with attendees quickly grab some s'more

00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:15,570
fondue boozy hot chocolate gushers

00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:17,339
grilled cheese Chloe comes out that's me

00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:19,589
intros to the PowerPoint karaoke

00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:22,230
speakers you laugh a lot the sugar is

00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:24,420
kicking in the panelists come onstage

00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:26,700
you learn a new or familiar topic from a

00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:28,950
truly diverse panel of speakers someone

00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,690
performs a song yeah we did that one

00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:32,099
time that was fun you grabbed your patch

00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:32,490
and sticker you get kicked out of the

00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:34,800
venue

00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:36,270
because you've stayed too long talking

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,920
to other folks and then I have an

00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:39,750
asterisk there's an introvert option

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,850
which is you go home post about how

00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:43,500
great a time you had on Twitter and

00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:47,430
catch up on Wes world because I've done

00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:49,200
that before too but we really did see a

00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:53,070
big difference between making our

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,570
meetups fun which honestly seemed like a

00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:56,880
no-brainer to me a musical-theater

00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:58,290
person now clearly you do not have to do

00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,210
patches and stickers for all your events

00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:02,600
I lovingly say that our meetup is the

00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:04,860
most extra meetup that ever meet upped

00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,869
but there's a lot of ways that you can

00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:08,310
do this so we found that a lot of folks

00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:09,780
find out about us through the commercial

00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:12,480
but it's mostly through word-of-mouth

00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:16,020
people say I went to a meet-up that was

00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,190
fun and people go what there was food

00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:20,190
that was delicious

00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:23,119
and also like PowerPoint karaoke and

00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:24,990
it's it's been kind of a mind-blowing

00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,990
phenomenon to me that people are like

00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:31,310
how did you think of this how did well I

00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:33,660
was bored and I wanted to make them fun

00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:37,109
the highest compliment that I've gotten

00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:38,340
in my career as an engineer was a person

00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:41,070
came up to me after a century Scouts

00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:44,640
meet up and said I've never laughed at a

00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:46,140
meet-up before which was crazy to me and

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,810
and that meet that made me very happy

00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:50,190
mission accomplished and yes we do

00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:52,050
really have patches for all the events

00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:54,330
definitely do come and check them out

00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:58,650
and get one of our only you can prevent

00:36:54,330 --> 00:37:01,800
dumpster fire pins here are a couple

00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:04,050
ways that I've seen other people do this

00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:07,650
successfully so another example of this

00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:10,170
is oh do I hit oh there's a question

00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:12,920
right over there but I think someone has

00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:16,500
a question what's going on sure do

00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:18,900
Chloe first of all great talk and may I

00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:23,670
say I love those pants oh my gosh thank

00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:25,680
you anyway what are some of the ways

00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:28,080
that we can make Tech Talks more

00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,369
engaging oh wow thank you so much for

00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:32,670
the question that I planted in the

00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:36,570
audience so this is actually something

00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:38,730
that I saw my good friend Eve Porcello

00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:41,490
do in a talk once at a react Meetup it

00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:43,050
was probably a roomful of 30 people we

00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:45,420
were all really tired after a meet-up

00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:46,380
not only was the technical example that

00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,880
she gave and her

00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:50,520
Dave we were all able to interact with

00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:53,400
it as she was doing it but she planted

00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:55,710
questions in the audience and it was so

00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,240
so so funny I have never seen a group of

00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:58,800
tired engineers wake up that quickly

00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,700
because we're all waiting for the next

00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,080
one to happen um so definitely there's

00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,970
there's some interesting ways that you

00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:08,130
can spice up your your technical talks

00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:09,960
if you're doing those um so maybe you

00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:11,550
hate public speaking maybe you don't

00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,830
think you're funny maybe you don't think

00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:16,560
your team can create some choice gifts

00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:19,140
this is not a call to action to get

00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:22,620
everyone to develop quirky content it's

00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:25,260
more of a call to action to bring humor

00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:28,290
to everything that you do why do we love

00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:30,720
HBO's Silicon Valley so much because

00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:33,930
it's realistic if it was a reality show

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:36,330
I would cry every time I watched it we

00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:38,100
love it because it's humorous um making

00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:39,690
people laugh is really one of the

00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:42,540
fastest ways to break down barriers

00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:43,500
between strangers win over an individual

00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,390
a group

00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:48,630
so next time you're creating a technical

00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:51,270
sample an application organizing a

00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:52,800
meet-up maybe even having an okay hour

00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:55,500
meeting that you know is gonna go really

00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,540
poorly um try to find the humor and the

00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:01,110
joy in it how can you make things better

00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:04,050
by lightening the mood Oh captain my

00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:06,810
captain channel your inner Jared who

00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:08,670
makes me laugh every single time so

00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:11,190
that's all from me thank you for

00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:13,950
listening to me tell a lot of really bad

00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:16,440
jokes I hope that you all have a

00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:17,940
wonderful conference and I will see you

00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,850
on the conference floor I am the one

00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:27,880
with polka dot pants thanks y'all

00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:27,880
