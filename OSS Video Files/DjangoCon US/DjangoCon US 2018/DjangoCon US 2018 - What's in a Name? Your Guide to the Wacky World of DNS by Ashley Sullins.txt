Description: 
	So, you built a Django application. Thatâ€™s great! Now, how do you get the app connected to your fancy domain name for the world to see? During this talk, youâ€™ll learn about the phone book of the internet, otherwise known as the Domain Name Systems (DNS). Weâ€™ll go over topics such as: why DNS was created, how it works, and why itâ€™s important for developers have a good understanding of DNS.

As a web developer who has launched hundreds of websites, Iâ€™ll tell you stories of some of my own DNS disasters and odd quirks that Iâ€™ve ran into over the last 5 years. If youâ€™ve ever wondered why you can see your newly launched website but your coworker canâ€™t, or if youâ€™re ready to launch your first client website, but not take down their email in the process, you wonâ€™t want to miss this talk.
