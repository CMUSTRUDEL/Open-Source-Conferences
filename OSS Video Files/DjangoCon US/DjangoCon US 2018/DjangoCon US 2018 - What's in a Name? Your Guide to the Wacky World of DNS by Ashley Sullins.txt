Title: DjangoCon US 2018 - What's in a Name? Your Guide to the Wacky World of DNS by Ashley Sullins
Publication date: 2018-11-08
Playlist: DjangoCon US 2018
Description: 
	So, you built a Django application. Thatâ€™s great! Now, how do you get the app connected to your fancy domain name for the world to see? During this talk, youâ€™ll learn about the phone book of the internet, otherwise known as the Domain Name Systems (DNS). Weâ€™ll go over topics such as: why DNS was created, how it works, and why itâ€™s important for developers have a good understanding of DNS.

As a web developer who has launched hundreds of websites, Iâ€™ll tell you stories of some of my own DNS disasters and odd quirks that Iâ€™ve ran into over the last 5 years. If youâ€™ve ever wondered why you can see your newly launched website but your coworker canâ€™t, or if youâ€™re ready to launch your first client website, but not take down their email in the process, you wonâ€™t want to miss this talk.

[Music]

00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:20,400
hi everyone thanks for coming I know

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,869
this is the last session so sure you

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,750
guys are excited to play some board

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:27,960
games later my name is Ashley and I'll

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,720
be talking about DNS so if you read the

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,930
description in in my in the session talk

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,149
you'll see that it said DNS and for some

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,730
people who are new to development you

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:41,430
might be wondering what is DNS and what

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:44,129
does it have to do with jingo that's a

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,860
great question so DNS is essentially how

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:48,989
IP addresses are associated with domain

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,730
names and technically you could be a

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,399
jingo developer and know nothing about

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,860
DNS but the nice thing is that it helps

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,539
with debugging so say your first memory

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,120
than your website crashes and you don't

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,300
know what's going on it might be a DNS

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,979
issue not necessarily a server issue

00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,560
it's also good if you're a freelancer or

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,840
a consultant you may be asked to lunch a

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,270
client's website and so it's helpful for

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,090
you to know how to do that and talk

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,310
through those steps in the process and

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,200
then you might be wondering why am i

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,920
speaking about this topic what do I know

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:26,490
about DNS umm so for the past six years

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,350
I've been helping launch websites I was

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,619
a software tester for several years at a

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:34,049
self-storage company and the developers

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:36,240
were like Oh DNS this is so boring will

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,310
teach the QA girl how to do this so

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,960
that's where I got my start and I got

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,939
really good at it and then I moved on to

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,570
other projects and taught our account

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,159
managers how to do DNS and then on my

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,170
current company I work at a very small

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,780
start-up so it just becomes part of my

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,610
job to launch all of our websites so I

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,180
would say between those two jobs I've

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:59,210
launched about 500 different websites

00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:02,009
and I bring it into every single issue

00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:05,329
probably that you could encounter from

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:08,550
taking down websites to breaking emails

00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:09,720
there's all sorts of tricks and things

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,840
that might come up when you're launching

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,930
a website so what we'll do at this talk

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,219
is that we'll act

00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,590
we pretend like we're launching a

00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:20,109
website and go through all the steps

00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:24,370
what we need in order to launch our new

00:02:20,109 --> 00:02:27,010
website so just a quick review most of

00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:29,319
you probably know a very basic

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:32,019
definition of the Internet is basically

00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,819
computers that talk to each other

00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:35,500
and DNS is the way that they communicate

00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:38,409
it's their common language

00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:41,019
it's short for domain name systems and

00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:44,769
it connects IP addresses to domains as I

00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:46,269
mentioned earlier I like to give this

00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:49,799
example to the account meander design

00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:53,319
teach about DNS that essentially a

00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:56,409
domain is like a name in your phone's

00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:58,090
address book so we know that this is my

00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:59,739
friend's name this was my friend Amy's

00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:03,370
phone number when she lived in Amsterdam

00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:07,959
and so the equivalent to this for DNS is

00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:09,609
the domain name so like google.com so

00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:11,439
Amy's phone numbers in our address book

00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:13,359
but I don't know it doesn't really

00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,049
matter I can change it to whatever I

00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,849
want

00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:19,299
but I'll still know if I want to contact

00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:22,449
Amy to just select her number in my

00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:24,790
address book and that is the equivalent

00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:26,829
to our IP address I mean technically we

00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,810
could go to an IP address and view the

00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:31,989
website but who wants to remember a

00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:35,949
bunch of random numbers when we can just

00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:37,299
go to google.com and something also in

00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:40,329
our address book sometimes our phone

00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:44,009
numbers come from Google or they come

00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:47,409
from Facebook and DNS has a similar

00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:49,479
functionality our numbers can come from

00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:51,579
a place called name servers and we'll

00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:56,349
talk more about those different places

00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:58,840
that our dns can come from so how does

00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:03,400
it all work what are the techniques

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,810
technical details of DNS so here's a

00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,250
picture that I found online but

00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:10,239
essentially what happens when you type

00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:13,569
in google.com is that you can your

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,870
computer will connect with the top-level

00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:18,820
domain DNS information and what a

00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,220
top-level domain is that's just whatever

00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:24,219
it's after the dot so with Google com

00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:27,760
that would be calm and so calm has a

00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:30,160
system of computers and it says hey you

00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,590
find Google's records at the Google name

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,480
servers and then once you go to the

00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:37,870
Google's name servers it will have an a

00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:40,120
record that will have the IP address

00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:43,690
that we are trying to hit and that will

00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:48,030
go back to your your computer and that

00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:50,410
will happen in a matter of milliseconds

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,850
so if you're going to want your clients

00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,100
website the first thing that you'll need

00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:57,460
is you're going to have to be able to

00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,650
find your your name servers and most

00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,900
clients are gonna have no idea what a

00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,070
domain or they know what their domain is

00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,620
but they don't know where their name

00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:07,780
servers are located or where any of this

00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,580
information might be but luckily we can

00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,790
help them out there's a website called

00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:15,610
who dot is and if you go to this website

00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:18,040
you can type in the domain name so like

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:21,490
for example this is a screenshot of

00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:24,010
Whois information you can type in my

00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:26,890
domain comm and it will show you where

00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:30,190
the registrar is and the Registrar is

00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:32,260
just where your domain is it's

00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:35,050
registered so if you go to GoDaddy and

00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:37,030
you register your domain then that is

00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,070
your registrar and in this case our

00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:43,870
registrar you can see the referral URL

00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:46,060
is domain.com if you scroll down on this

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:49,300
page you'll also see information on name

00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:53,110
servers our name servers are where our

00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:55,780
actual dns information lives and a lot

00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:58,090
of the time this information will be in

00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:01,060
the same place as your registrar but

00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,350
sometimes it's not in this example it

00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,440
happens to be in the same area

00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:06,910
mydomain.com

00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,920
but you know for for other web sites

00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:12,640
they may be hosting them like amazon

00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:15,190
route 53 or various other places that

00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,810
you can have named servers and like if

00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,450
you're using GoDaddy their name servers

00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:21,820
are not secure server net I just know

00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:23,890
that from watching a lot of websites but

00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,870
you can easily look that information up

00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:29,530
online and look at their FAQ

00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:32,800
documentation so we have the name

00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:34,570
servers we have our registrar we're

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,550
ready to launch right like we're good to

00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,990
go

00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:39,550
okay hold up there's a couple of

00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:42,160
precautions that we need to take prior

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,960
to launching our website

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,360
I've kind of created this pre-launch

00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,290
checklist that things that I recommend

00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,110
you doing prior to launching a website

00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:54,580
the first thing that I highly highly

00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:57,220
recommend that you do is to take a

00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:59,610
screenshot of the current DNS and you'll

00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:02,170
see later why this is really important

00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,820
but it's always good to have a history

00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:07,240
of that information that you can go back

00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:08,980
in case anything goes wrong I've had you

00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,540
know I've launched some sites and then

00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,650
the Account Manager will come back a

00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,570
couple minutes later and be like

00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:16,120
actually the client didn't want to

00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:18,850
launch that website yet just kidding go

00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,430
back to the old DNS information so you

00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:24,190
just never know the other thing that I

00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:27,520
recommend is doing a final smoke test of

00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:29,440
your production server this can be in a

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,350
variety of ways you could just hit like

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,380
the IP address before you launch or you

00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:38,170
can also create a production environment

00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,730
that is um like password protected

00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:43,450
because you don't want to run into any

00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:46,300
issues with SEO issues with duplicate

00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:48,250
content so we want this to be guarded

00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:52,240
away from Google and just specifically

00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:53,680
for development usage only and then also

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,900
as I said before make sure you have

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,090
access to the correct records often

00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,560
times I will get DNS information and

00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,840
then it turns out the name servers are

00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,130
somewhere else and it gets kind of

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,750
frustrating because everyone's really

00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,400
excited to launch a website and we just

00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,710
don't have the correct information so

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,630
make sure that you've done done your dig

00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:14,530
done your who is and you've found that

00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:17,080
information so this is an example of

00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:19,900
what DNS records look like if you've

00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,210
never seen DNS records before this is

00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,890
how we would launch a website we this is

00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,900
a very typical configuration and

00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:27,490
obviously some many servers have

00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,470
different configurations but this is our

00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,810
standard for all the sites that I've

00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:34,360
launched through the years there's

00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:36,340
typically an a record and this is the

00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,630
record that says hey this is the server

00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,270
that you go to when you go to this

00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:42,969
website and then there's also a cname

00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:45,820
record and a CD cname record is just a

00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:47,830
sub-domain record and you can have a dub

00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,930
dub dub record or you can have an

00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:53,200
asterisk and the asterisk just means

00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:54,430
catch-all and what how that works is if

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,209
you go to anything that's not

00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:57,910
specifically

00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:59,709
defined by your DNS records it will

00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:02,740
automatically reach or redirect you to

00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:04,600
wherever the catch-all is pointing to so

00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:07,869
in this case the catch-all is pointing

00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:10,179
to the a record the two pixels right com

00:09:07,869 --> 00:09:12,850
and so anything that is not specifically

00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:16,929
defined by our DNS records will take us

00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:19,389
straight to the IP address all right so

00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:23,740
we've launched our website exciting

00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:26,319
times but wait I don't know if anyone's

00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:28,240
ever heard this before but I can't see

00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:32,439
the new website where is it what's going

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:35,019
on okay it's gonna be okay take a deep

00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:38,259
breath and we will troubleshoot what's

00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:40,329
happening here so where is my new

00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:42,369
website so let's talk a little bit about

00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:44,740
the different types of DNS servers

00:09:42,369 --> 00:09:46,660
there's the authoritative DNS server

00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,399
this is the server where DNS information

00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,319
is stored so this is where we're

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,579
changing the DNS information this is

00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:53,910
where we were when we launched our

00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:56,949
website and then there's recursive DNS

00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:59,019
information and this is the DNS servers

00:09:56,949 --> 00:10:02,319
that look up information on an

00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:06,100
authoritative server and depending on

00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:07,779
how you're looking at your website there

00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,480
could be several layers of recursive DNS

00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:12,790
servers you have your your browser you

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,949
have your internet service provider and

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,329
then if there are firewalls anything

00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:18,970
like that there can be several other

00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:22,329
recursive DNS servers that you have to

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:25,089
go through in order to see your website

00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:26,949
and authoritative servers tell the

00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:29,649
recursive DNS servers to look for new

00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:31,240
information every number of seconds and

00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:33,819
this number of seconds is called the

00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,139
time to live or a TTL for short so when

00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:37,569
you go in and you look at your DNS

00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:40,749
records you will see a number of seconds

00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:43,179
called the TTL and the longer the TTL of

00:10:40,749 --> 00:10:45,579
a longer it will take for the recursive

00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:48,009
DNS to check for the authoritative dns

00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:50,499
server changes so essentially a TTL is

00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:52,869
saying like every number of seconds

00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:57,850
check for for changes to this

00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:59,949
information best practice in an ideal

00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,839
world you would set the TTL to the

00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:05,220
smallest number of seconds allowed by

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,779
the name server 24 to 48 hours to launch

00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,980
sometimes this happens often times you

00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:11,350
know I'm told we got a

00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,600
now we don't really have time to set the

00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:17,410
TTL and then that's when you'll run into

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,820
issues like propagation issues where

00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,940
where some people will see the website

00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:25,510
or they'll still continue to see the old

00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:28,240
website um you don't want to if you

00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:29,920
change the TTL you don't want to keep

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,440
this number low because you don't want

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,839
the DNS servers to keep looking for this

00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,889
information every second or so that's

00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:43,000
just not very efficient and then also

00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:45,490
just remember DNS caching so even though

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,279
you may be able to see a website on your

00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:50,230
computer you know perhaps the Director

00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:53,560
of Sales just still won't be able to see

00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:56,860
it so we typically tell our clients give

00:11:53,560 --> 00:12:00,600
about 2 to 24 hours to see the website

00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:03,910
and if you're still having issues best

00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,639
my best practice is when whenever I'm

00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:10,690
not sure like is this a DNS issue or is

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:13,360
this a a caching issue I'll look at a

00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:16,209
site on my mobile device so if you turn

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,949
off Wi-Fi on your mobile device

00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:20,500
it will directly connect you to the

00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:23,110
authoritative servers and so the changes

00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:26,769
to your dns should all like appear

00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:28,630
pretty much instantaneously so if you

00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:31,000
look it on your on your mobile device in

00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:33,670
you're still seeing an old website or

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,170
it's just not redirecting there are a

00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:38,910
couple other things that you can do in

00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:38,910
order to troubleshoot these issues

00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:45,519
always check the route a record this is

00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:49,089
the record that tells our tells the name

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,920
servers this is where our servers are so

00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:53,860
make sure there are no misspellings or

00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:56,199
anything weird in there also check that

00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:59,769
you have a dub dub dub or catch-all

00:12:56,199 --> 00:13:01,480
record if sometimes people will launch

00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:03,060
websites and they'll forget to put this

00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,399
in so if you go to dub dub dub

00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:07,690
mydomain.com they're not going to see

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,930
anything it's gonna say that it doesn't

00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:13,209
exist because the DNS the name servers

00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:16,139
don't know what to do when you go to dub

00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,139
dub dub mydomain.com

00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:21,780
um also like I said before verify your

00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:24,720
name servers we have who dot is that has

00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:27,150
good data and then you can also go on to

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,940
your command line and run a command

00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:30,480
called dig so you can do dig

00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:34,140
mydomain.com

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,270
and then any or actually a lot of people

00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:38,220
have stopped using any because that's

00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:41,670
hard on their server so you can do dig

00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:44,780
mydomain.com and then just ns and that

00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:49,020
will show you the name servers that your

00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:52,230
computer are it's currently seeing and

00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:53,580
then step four is you will check for to

00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:56,760
see if the domain is being redirected

00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:58,350
outside of dns so I always use GoDaddy

00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,940
as an example not because I work for

00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,190
GoDaddy or anything but that's how I

00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,110
often launch websites a lot of people

00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:06,450
register their websites at GoDaddy calm

00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:08,850
but you can scroll past the DNS

00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:12,510
information and you'll see where there's

00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:14,340
a redirect link and sometimes like the

00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:16,140
domain will be redirecting to another

00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:20,520
domain it will need to remove that in

00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:24,090
order to actually be able to use the DNS

00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:26,280
information correctly if there is an

00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:30,540
issue where the website looks fine on

00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:31,890
your computer but on mobile you can but

00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,050
you can't really see anything on mobile

00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:38,450
you're still seeing the old website you

00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:41,580
can check for an M or a mobile record

00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:43,470
sometimes different vendors will use M

00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,570
records to show a mobile version of

00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:48,830
their website and if you don't have that

00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:52,110
kind of DNS or a server configuration

00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:55,200
it's just not necessary so if you have a

00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:57,510
catch-all cname record you can just

00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,210
remove those and then anytime someone

00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:04,320
goes to M my domain com

00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:07,200
it will redirect them to the the domain

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,430
because that's how it's set up or if you

00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,380
are using the dub-dub-dub

00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:11,760
for whatever reason maybe your DNS

00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,200
provider doesn't allow you to put

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,750
kettle's

00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,420
you'll have to set a an M or a mobile

00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,830
record that's pointing to your domain so

00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:24,600
that I will know to go to that IP

00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:26,850
address and this is just an example of a

00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,730
dig that you can do on the command line

00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:30,630
and then I also found a tool on over the

00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:34,620
weekend that

00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:36,600
can go to Google and Google has a a tool

00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,760
box that you can use to also do digs

00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:42,000
through the UI if you're not comfortable

00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:45,810
with command prompt but but this will

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,180
show you this is where my company's DNS

00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:51,570
information is located it's in Amazon

00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:54,390
Web Services so say I wanted to launch a

00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:57,300
a new version of their website I would

00:15:54,390 --> 00:16:02,180
have to have access to route 53 which is

00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:05,100
Amazon Web Services DNS provider or I

00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:07,290
would have to at least get a screenshot

00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:11,100
of that data to make sure that I am NOT

00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:12,900
that I'm not missing any information

00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:17,640
technically you can launch a website

00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:19,770
without getting the the name server

00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,540
information you can just dig for it all

00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,340
but there's a chance that you could

00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,050
potentially break their email because

00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:27,480
you don't have all the MX records or all

00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:29,460
the cname records it's not a perfect

00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,320
science so make sure you get a copy of

00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:35,250
those name server records from their

00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:38,190
previous provider um so the sites live

00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:41,090
everything's looking good but the client

00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:44,220
called and their emails not working oh

00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:48,330
all right well we can figure this out

00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:51,750
what's going on here so anytime you're

00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:53,490
troubleshooting email issues the first

00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:56,910
this is where our screen shots going to

00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:59,130
come in really handy we can go back to

00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:02,490
the old records that they were using and

00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:05,310
make sure that we copied all the MX

00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:07,020
records make sure they are correct if

00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:09,600
you're not familiar with MX records

00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,790
those are just the records that whenever

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,140
an email comes in

00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:19,890
that's what server to go to in order to

00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:22,260
send that mail in to the website so an

00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:26,220
MX record typically has a number and a

00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:29,310
URL the number is the priority of which

00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:32,460
server which email server the mail

00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:35,100
should be delivered to and then the URL

00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,540
is where mail servers are located so for

00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,630
like Google Apps for Business they

00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:41,480
typically have five MX records and if

00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:43,590
one is not working for whatever reason

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,620
it always had the one that's going to

00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,630
priority zero

00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:49,300
first if that's not working for whatever

00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:51,730
reason then it will go to the next one

00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:57,070
that's highest in priority or the lowest

00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:59,290
number if you RC you're looking at the

00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:01,210
MX records you realize oh it's going to

00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:04,690
zero at mydomain.com

00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:06,670
and you change the IP address so that

00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:08,470
means that their email unless you're

00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,760
hosting their email their email server

00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:13,330
is not there anymore

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,540
so what do you do in this case you would

00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:18,670
create a cname record called mail

00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:21,250
pointing to the old IP address and what

00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:24,100
this does is it just says hey like the

00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:27,100
email it lives on this old IP address

00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:30,400
and then step two you'll need to change

00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:35,530
the MX record from zero mydomain.com

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:37,660
to zero mail mydomain.com and then when

00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:39,460
email comes through it will see the MX

00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,950
record and it will see that the server

00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:46,059
is located at mail at mydomain.com

00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:50,410
and the mail will hopefully start

00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:53,170
working accordingly all right you did it

00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:57,700
your site is live it's very exciting the

00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:59,530
cats are very happy for you all right so

00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:02,080
that's a lot to go through in 20 minutes

00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:04,270
and if you're still curious on how DNS

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,700
works there are a lot of additional

00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:09,010
resources that you can take a look at

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,570
online and then I also have a link to

00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:15,940
the Google Apps Digg command that you

00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:18,610
can use online and my presentation can

00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:20,020
be found at this URL and that's all I

00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:22,740
have for tonight

00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:30,189
so thank you

00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:30,189
