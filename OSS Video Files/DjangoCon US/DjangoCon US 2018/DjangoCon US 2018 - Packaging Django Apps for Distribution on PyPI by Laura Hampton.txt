	DjangoCon US 2018 - Packaging Django Apps for Distribution on PyPI by Laura Hampton

One of the strengths of Django is that it allows you to use apps created by other developers, so you donâ€™t have to spend time rewriting something that someone else has already written. However, creating Python packages for distribution via the Python Package Index is a process that is unfamiliar to most developers. In this talk, you will learn about creating a reusable Django app. The talk will cover how a Django app differs from a package like requests, and how an app interacts with models and URLs in an existing project.

While the talk will include a discussion of how to upload a Django app to PyPI, the parts that discuss how to make reusable Django apps will be useful to developers who are working at organizations where they may not be able to open-source their code.

This talk is intended for Django developers who have some familiarity with how Django works, and an interest in code reuse and packaging.
