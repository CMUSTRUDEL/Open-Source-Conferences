Title: DjangoCon US 2018 -  Your web framework needs you! by Carlton Gibson
Publication date: 2018-11-08
Playlist: DjangoCon US 2018
Description: 
	Django looks like itâ€™s doing just fine: itâ€™s a popular framework in a popular language. We have major releases every six months. We have Django Girls, a Foundation (and Fellows), super conferences in glamorous locations, and more.

But the code is old, there are 1300+ accepted open issues. Thereâ€™s only the smallest number of people that regularly contribute code.

Itâ€™s fine now. But it wonâ€™t be. Your web framework needs you!

Contributing to open source is great, and itâ€™s great for you. Historically weâ€™ve not been that good at encouraging new and diverse contributors. Weâ€™re trying to change that, and we want to invite you to come and join-in.

Iâ€™m going to tell you quickly how to get involved, how to get support in that, and how to let us know if thatâ€™s failing.

You are qualified to contribute. More than that, your contribution is the future of Django. Come code.

[Music]

00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,970
Hey

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,810
Oh which way hang on which way this way

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:26,160
this way

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:28,050
hello right you've seen all the slides

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,590
already so I'm gonna sit down again

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,570
hello I'm Carlton Gibson Who am I I'm a

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,460
long-term Django user I'm a maintainer

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,620
on Django rest framework and crisp

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,930
Django filter gang of crispy forms and

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,730
since January of this year along with

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,309
Tim grain who's been doing it for a long

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,350
time and the new Django fellow what's

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:48,270
the Django fellow mean and we are

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,489
contracted by the Django Software

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,590
Foundation the DSF and we basically do

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:53,190
the day-to-day running of the project to

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,610
keep it going

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:59,190
we handle the ticket triage we do patch

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,829
review we do security work we do the

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,570
releases it's the sort of stuff that on

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,030
a project of Django sighs he just

00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,060
wouldn't happen without the fellowship

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,220
program and the hope of the fellowship

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,140
program is we let contributors that's

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,070
you focus on the fun stuff which is

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,140
writing code so it's in this capacity

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,750
that I'm here to say to you the your web

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,100
framework needs you I'm sorry about this

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,439
slide what I wanted to do is get

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,810
Kitchener and the Django Pony and do

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,820
some sort of thing but my skills and

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,799
time they just went up to it Django

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,079
looks healthy right we have major

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,610
releases every six months or so we have

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,860
conferences all over the world in

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,049
glamorous locations we have a foundation

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,329
we have fellows right but the core

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:45,119
framework is maintained by a really

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:50,850
really small number of people we need

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:53,670
more we need we need you they are so I

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,079
put the end of this little graph I ran

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,700
this little git command and what that

00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,170
gives you is a list of contributors with

00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,670
the number of commits they have and I

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,880
plotted it like this so you could see

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:05,820
the power law since Django 2.1 there

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,979
have been about 481 commits to the repo

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,780
from a hundred and twenty one individual

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:13,290
committees and that sounds amazing

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,800
but outside the group of the group of

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,840
fellows

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,780
the people who are doing the commits is

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,280
it's like half a dozen people right and

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,810
then there's a really long pay there's a

00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,730
few well another half a dozen who do

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,740
some commits and then maybe a hard for

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:29,520
dozen that are doing like one or two and

00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:32,550
then there's lots of individual commits

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,350
from people it's okay we keep it going

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:38,280
but the first problem is it's just not

00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:41,760
simply enough there are 1,300 accepted

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,950
tickets on the Django repo now maybe

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,110
that's okay right Django is a mature

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,640
framework bumbles along that Green Line

00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,250
is the changeover time you see it's

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,840
basically stays the same forever and we

00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,820
close an awful lot of tickets but more

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,560
ones come along but for me I think we

00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,900
need to be more dynamic than this if

00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,880
Django is going to stay relevant for

00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,030
another 10 years we need to be

00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,470
addressing this if we aren't going to

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,210
close these issues at some point we

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,860
should just declare the scope of the

00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:11,910
project smaller and close them as out of

00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:13,620
scope right for me it's okay we keep it

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,570
going we keep up with the database

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,730
changes we keep up with the version

00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:20,130
changes we get the new releases out but

00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,950
there's not much capacity to do more

00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:25,530
than that okay but the second problem is

00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:28,560
it's just not representative if you look

00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:30,930
at all the contributors there it's quite

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,200
white it's not all white but it's quite

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:36,360
white and it's very male okay and that's

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,360
not what I see in the room in front of

00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,790
me not at all if you look down just to

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,489
the few core contributors then he's very

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:48,480
very white and it's all male

00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:51,750
okay and I took this at those numbers

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,370
from salt since 2.1 but i could have

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,739
picked any time in the repost history

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:58,590
there's this thing it's called django

00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:00,450
core the django core team and it's it's

00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,370
the great and the good of the Django

00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,260
project is everybody who's done all the

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,120
good stuff over time and there's two

00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,070
problems with the Django core inmate

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,440
core team it makes it look like the core

00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:13,530
team is 50 strong well it's not it's

00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:17,310
half a dozen people right but it's still

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:20,790
not representative it's still white men

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,740
and very little else so this is

00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,350
recognized there's a Django enhancement

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,250
proposal to dissolve the Django core to

00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:30,910
get rid of it you can

00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:38,950
get out um and that will go through I

00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:40,120
think I need to have a sip of water but

00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,000
it's only half the story

00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,380
right we remove one power structure

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,290
would get rid of this Django core which

00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,760
is the governing it runs it runs the

00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,560
framework it's the technical team that

00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,750
run the framework and make the decisions

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,070
but how do we make sure that we don't

00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,370
replace it with something which is

00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:59,290
exactly the same how do we get new

00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:03,040
contribute contributions from across the

00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,540
community that's you I don't know the

00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,130
answers to that I really don't I've got

00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,350
some ideas but they're probably naive

00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:11,890
and they don't touch on the real issues

00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,850
so we need help so what I'm gonna do is

00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,530
I'm going to tell you how to get

00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,180
involved and how to tell us when that's

00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,790
not working and then I'm going to ask

00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,410
you to help us go further than that

00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,669
simple is that right so how do you get

00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,830
involved whether contributing guide

00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:25,300
you'd like to contribute to Django but

00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,680
you don't know how this document will

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,200
explain our process and how to get

00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,240
involved well that sounds promising

00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,410
right but it it's not the solution

00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,210
because we've had that for years and

00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,950
we're in the situation that we're in

00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,990
we're not getting contributions from

00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,800
across the community but it is a good

00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,560
starting point

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,940
so the first it's it's it's the basis of

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,430
what we've got and it's where we need to

00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,960
build on to change to go forward so the

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,810
first thing I do is say do read it and

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,380
have a look around and the the related

00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:54,640
documents do tell you some good stuff

00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:57,040
the first thing is joined Django

00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,450
developers this is a mailing list I know

00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,520
I know you've got no time for Django

00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:01,690
developers you're busy you've got no

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,870
time for another mailing list and

00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:07,120
frankly it's quite dull but join it

00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:10,270
anyway then go to the notifications and

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,640
turn them off right and then check in

00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,560
every so often just to sort of have a

00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,140
look around right as you get more

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,270
involved it becomes more relevant but

00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:22,000
just sign up for it and turn off the

00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:23,950
notifications there's another mailing

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,260
list though and it's almost a secret

00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:28,510
it's called Django Corps mentorship now

00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:31,150
if we don't do a good job of advertising

00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:33,220
this it gets approximately zero traffic

00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,200
but it is a place where experienced

00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,750
contributors are signed up to help you

00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,860
to get started contributing so join

00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,630
Django developers and turn off

00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,150
notifications but then join

00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,860
joke or mentorship and sending an email

00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:48,400
to it saying how I I want to get

00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:50,890
involved can you help me now this isn't

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,890
an official mentoring program right

00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:55,270
maybe we need one maybe we need some

00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:57,850
input on what that prime mentorship

00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:00,340
program would look like but Jango Corps

00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:02,350
mentorship is already there it already

00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:05,170
exists and it already has paid people

00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:06,490
who experience people waiting to help so

00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,800
let's use that in the interim while

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:12,430
we're coming up with something better

00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:14,110
okay when you get stuck you send an

00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:17,410
email to Jango cool mentorship I'm stuck

00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:19,540
I'm trying to do this I can't I can't

00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:22,810
turn off the notifications for Jango

00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:24,370
development right the next step then is

00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:26,260
get set up with the code right now

00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:29,860
you've you've done this a million times

00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:32,560
you clone the repo so get clone comes

00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:38,770
down takes a while create a Burch lens -

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:43,180
- MDM right install the requirements pip

00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:45,970
install run the test run tests right and

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,710
that's it just run the test suite to see

00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,720
it see the Jango test suite in action if

00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,920
you can't do it send an email to Jango

00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,920
called mention I can't I'm trying to get

00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:56,680
set up with the code right that's it if

00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,860
you get stuck emails then the next bit

00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,580
this is the best bit find a ticket this

00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,400
can be hard

00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:06,040
it was 1328 I've been accepted tickets

00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,320
well where do I begin well do the

00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:11,080
contributing guys says look for tickets

00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,740
that are easy pickings this isn't going

00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,260
to cut it

00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:19,990
there are 1328 accepted tickets of which

00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:22,060
exactly 13 are marked as easy right so

00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,880
we're not using this flag correctly

00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:28,300
right but it's not binary it's not like

00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,120
there are 13 easy tickets and 1,300

00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:34,840
phenomenally hard ones

00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:37,419
alright yes there are some phenomenally

00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,280
hard tickets right and there's a whole

00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:41,919
load of ones which yes they are pretty

00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,560
tricky but the vast majority of the

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,020
tickets are no harder than the problems

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,900
you solve every single day using Django

00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:52,180
I promise you right yes they need time

00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:54,580
yes they need thoughts yes they need a

00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:57,339
little bit of your love but they're not

00:08:54,580 --> 00:09:01,750
hard not harder than the problems you

00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:03,100
already solve as a matter of course the

00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,450
reason they're not solved already is

00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,089
because there's too many of them

00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:09,070
there's 1,300 of the things and the

00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:11,200
contributors are too few so there's a

00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:13,120
massive opportunity for you to get

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,010
involved you can make a massive

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,160
difference and here's the little trick

00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:20,019
if you start if you start looking at a

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,510
ticket and you get stuck you can either

00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:23,920
open a pull request and say this is what

00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:25,180
I've got or you can email Django called

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,730
mention saying I'm trying to solve this

00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,870
issue and the people who haven't got the

00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,610
time to solve it by themself they'll

00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,980
jump in and help you they'll give you

00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,750
the advice they all it needs is that

00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:39,810
little bit of input from you saying I'm

00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:39,810
actually looking at this so please do

00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:46,060
yeah so is there a bit of Django that

00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:48,550
you're using that isn't right do you hit

00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:51,190
a bug at work do you you're googling

00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:53,740
around it do you that is there a ticket

00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:57,010
there do that what was my first ticket

00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,660
on Django the one point eight the the

00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:00,579
templates you couldn't instantiate a

00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,410
template without specifying a template

00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:03,700
back-end but I only got one back in it's

00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,339
the default world can't we just use that

00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,079
yes we can okay so he that was my first

00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,970
patch on Jango

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,550
why was i qualified to do that bill

00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:16,680
because it's the bug I was having right

00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:18,820
right then submitter take a PR okay

00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:22,420
looks easy when you didn't know that it

00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:23,050
takes time it takes time you've got to

00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,810
do docks

00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:28,060
you've got to do tests you open the PR

00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:32,410
you get feedback you make changes you do

00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:34,920
you get more feedback can you adjust the

00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:37,060
line wrapping yes okay

00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,180
can you revert this irrelevant change

00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:42,640
yes okay you've you've added some white

00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:44,730
space yes okay right it can feel hard

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,260
it's about quality here right

00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:49,660
Django's good why do you use it why is

00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:52,660
it lasted so long because it's good it's

00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:55,750
but the review process is about keeping

00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:57,760
it good don't take it personally it's

00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:00,699
not personal everybody gets the same

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:04,570
review everybody you can be a superstar

00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:06,550
code or a you've messed up the white

00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,500
space here can you change the line

00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:11,890
wrapping you it's it's not personal

00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,960
don't take it that way if you feel

00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:15,610
difficult if it feels they've got reach

to study it I have to spend the time

00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,530
going through it is this the right

00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:09,340

00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,430
contributing to Django rest framework

00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:26,740
that's how I learned to do it there are

00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,450
lots of projects all under maintain that

00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,990

forms I would love your help because I

00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,840
don't have the time there so there is

00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:43,510
any number of opportunities for you to

00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,650
get involved there are other tasks you

00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,850
can work you don't have to work on the

00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:48,370
code you can work on the documentation

00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:50,560
that's you know work on tickets there

00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,210
you can work on translations there's an

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,250
operations things you know about ansible

00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:55,660
and all those Jenkins and things like

00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:58,180
that you could help there there's a

00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,370
security team do you know about web

00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,660
security yeah okay there's a trust issue

00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,920
you have to get yourself known because

00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,270
it's a position of truck but you could

00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,210
work on the security team if you're

00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:10,360
qualified there's any number of options

00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:12,280
right but the big one that we really as

00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,050
well as all of these things we really

00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,720
need your help on is to help smooth the

00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:20,410
on-ramp right the existing how to guide

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,690
the contribution guide doesn't cut it we

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:25,450
we don't have contributions from across

00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:29,560
the django community we have a bunch of

00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:33,040
white men mainly so how can we smooth

00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,990
the on-ramp how can we make it better so

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,890
that whatever isn't inviting comes

00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:40,330
inviting email Django cool mentorship

00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:43,450
I'm finding that this is a barrier to

00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:45,670
people getting involved reach out again

00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,490
the answer is basically yes we just

00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:51,550
don't know what the questions are yet

00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:53,440
right so we have an opportunity to build

00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,390
a future Django here we're getting rid

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,510
of this the core team and it's a it's a

00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:00,970
point where we need to well we have an

00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,710
opportunity let's let's use it right

00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,390
they can help but the change can't come

00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,760
from the same small group of people that

00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:09,490
are doing the contribution the change

00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:12,820
needs to come for new contributors fresh

00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:17,140
input from across the community we need

00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:19,470
you your web framework needs you I come

00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,470
and join us

00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:28,589
