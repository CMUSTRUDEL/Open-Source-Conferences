Title: DjangoCon US 2018 -  Your web framework needs you! by Carlton Gibson
Publication date: 2018-11-08
Playlist: DjangoCon US 2018
Description: 
	Django looks like itâ€™s doing just fine: itâ€™s a popular framework in a popular language. We have major releases every six months. We have Django Girls, a Foundation (and Fellows), super conferences in glamorous locations, and more.

But the code is old, there are 1300+ accepted open issues. Thereâ€™s only the smallest number of people that regularly contribute code.

Itâ€™s fine now. But it wonâ€™t be. Your web framework needs you!

Contributing to open source is great, and itâ€™s great for you. Historically weâ€™ve not been that good at encouraging new and diverse contributors. Weâ€™re trying to change that, and we want to invite you to come and join-in.

Iâ€™m going to tell you quickly how to get involved, how to get support in that, and how to let us know if thatâ€™s failing.

You are qualified to contribute. More than that, your contribution is the future of Django. Come code.
