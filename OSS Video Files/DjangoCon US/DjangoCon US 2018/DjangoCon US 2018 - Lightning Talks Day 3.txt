[Music]

00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:27,550
all right hi my name is Rachel Calhoun

00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:30,010
my talk is how my wife got me fired

00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:34,600
spoiler alert we're still married okay

00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:36,160
so don't worry so before I can kind of

00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,450
get that's my wife her name is dying

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,500
she's great

00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:44,050
so before we get started my origin story

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,180
I graduated with a degree in Spanish in

00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,620
French I didn't know what to do with my

00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:50,530
life so I went to Korea and I taught

00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:53,350
English there for nine years while I was

00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,879
there I met my wife but I thought wow I

00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,559
have to find a career like what I'm

00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:01,659
gonna do when I go back to the US so I

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:03,670
started oh yeah okay so for I have four

00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:05,770
foreign languages I speak French Spanish

00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:09,130
I studied Arabic and I speak Korean now

00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:11,530
in English two bachelor's degrees in a

00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,330
treble hit so I went to Korea and this

00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,010
is me having fun with little kids that's

00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,930
basically why I loved it I loved

00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,920
teaching it was really fun but I thought

00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:22,870
like what I'm gonna do with my life

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,340
after this in the US so then there were

00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,950
two people they were starting a Python

00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,210
users group or and so we met up every

00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,120
Saturday we'd do some online courses

00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,500
through Coursera or EDX and for about

00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,320
here we studied all kinds of stuff with

00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,550
Python and some of them are program some

00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,740
of them were programmers some of them

00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:41,440
were just you know students that wanted

00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:43,690
to learn something new and then I became

00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:47,440
an organizer jangle girl's soul it was

00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:48,670
huge it blew up and since I was in a

00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,110
leader position I was like well I should

00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,570
take this more seriously I should know

00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:55,590
what I'm talking about so I started you

00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:58,750
know study a little bit harder and then

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:02,470
I went to I got a scholarship to go to

00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:05,020
Gen Con Europe and there I saw a talk

00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:07,210
about by Rebecca Connelly who I now work

00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,580
with about becoming a developer from

00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,560
dancer developer and late later in life

00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:16,540
transition career transitions so I was

00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:18,099
like I can do this and then Lacey if you

00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,890
know her anyway she encouraged me to do

00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:22,780
a talk it you know Channel con us so I

00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,940
did I applied a few talks and I got one

00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:29,800
accepted so I did talk there and get in

00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:31,750
version control and so I was like you

00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,480
know then we got married I moved you

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,280
know temporarily with my parents and I

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,660
tons of application job applications a

00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,980
ton of interviews and I had a job offer

00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:43,870
I was like yay right I made it so I got

00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,300
a lease I moved there and the first day

00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:49,030
of work they gave me a code of ethics

00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,410
they asked me to sign and part of it

00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,970
said I believe a marriage is only

00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,410
between a man and a woman and obviously

00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:56,380
I couldn't sign this because I don't

00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:58,599
believe that so it was very hard for me

00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:01,870
to give this up because I work so hard

00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:03,580
to get my first job in tech but I did I

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,799
told them I couldn't sign it and the

00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,420
next day they fired me and it was

00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:08,440
totally legal and there's nothing I

00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,000
could do about it and that's the same

00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,690
day we got the president we have now so

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,730
that day was really a rough day for me

00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,829
yeah but luckily this ended up to be a

00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,060
great pity story to some people here and

00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:20,680
I told them about it and they helped me

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,819
out they stepped up and that's why I

00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,709
like this general community is so

00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:25,360
important to me because they helped me

00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:28,120
in a couple weeks later I found another

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,370
job remote and now and they found my

00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,160
second job remote too so people here are

00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,200
really important so basically it's an

00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,269
awesome community so thank you and and

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,250
you know who you are but basically keep

00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:43,170
creating inclusive and supportive spaces

00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:49,110
and more importantly bow thank you

00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:49,110
[Applause]

00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,659
so this is a new project that we just

00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,069
put on github a few months ago we've

00:03:56,659 --> 00:04:00,470
been using it internally for a while

00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:02,900
papÃ© install code read CMS if you happen

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:06,319
to have a fresh virtually envy hanging

00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:09,140
out but this is a wagtail based CMS for

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,819
marketing websites we really set out to

00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,230
build a viable wordpress alternative

00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:13,910
we've been using it our clients have

00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:16,910
been loving it so if you're not familiar

00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:18,650
with wagtail it's great CMS framework

00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,299
it's it's pretty popular right now

00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:23,660
there's been a couple talks about it

00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:25,130
here so this is really all you need to

00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,169
do to get started no coding required

00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:30,350
just pip install and then the usual

00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:34,280
Django tedium migrate crate superuser

00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:39,590
run server etc so I'm going to do that

00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:41,180
right now and I've to prevent the Wi-Fi

00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:49,060
from bombing out I've already installed

00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:53,470
it so run server oh that's weird

00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,470
see Thank You PowerPoint

00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:03,380
okay don't go Python managed we py run

00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:07,759
server this is after a fresh pip install

00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:12,710
and I'm going to go to my browser go to

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:15,169
localhost 8009 empty website this is you

00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,849
know familiar when you install wagtail

00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:21,009
you get a empty page so let's go to the

00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:23,630
admin i created a super user logged in

00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:25,880
but we can go right away and start

00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:31,280
editing so let's do a little bit of

00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:40,820
styling settings leo and we can add a

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:43,099
logo do django con and maybe we want to

00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,220
change the navbar to a darker colored

00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:47,630
navbar this is all based on bootstrap

00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:51,020
bootstrap for so feel free to use

00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:52,610
bootstrap for classes anywhere and let's

00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:56,389
check out there's our logo a nice

00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:57,830
branded experience and local state

00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:03,020
thousand cool we got our logo there

00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:03,680
let's start editing the homepage so out

00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,900
of the box

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,090
you know we have custom page types we

00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,639
have the stream field is loaded with

00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:12,440
blocks that you can start using there's

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,120
SEO attributes and all kinds of other

00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,520
stuff that you know is just there

00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,919
out-of-the-box but everything's based on

00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,860
the bootstrap grid system so we'll add

00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:24,199
actually let's add a hero unit and do

00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:29,389
something a little bit flashy ER hero

00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:31,539
units let's grab a background image this

00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:34,759
is all meant to be very general purpose

00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:36,590
and designed for specifically marketing

00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:39,500
websites something you would probably

00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:44,770
use WordPress for and not be very happy

00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,770
about it so let's just add some text

00:06:53,660 --> 00:07:02,160
and let's make this a h2 let's add a

00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:05,310
button below this will just do learn

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,660
more button it's not gonna point to

00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,690
anything right now

00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,430
and because it is bootstrap there's a

00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,009
lot of the bootstrap stuff that you're

00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:16,550
familiar with already built in so we'll

00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:20,419
do outline lay and we'll do large and

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:23,940
let's preview what we have so far

00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:26,550
cool we got our website going let's add

00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:29,460
one more thing since we still have a few

00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,569
minutes let's add some cards these are

00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,229
bootstrap cards

00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:35,669
we'll just every all the bootstrap

00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:37,650
components are pretty much already built

00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:39,979
into this so you can feel free to go

00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:46,440
crazy with it

00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:51,840
Jango subtitle or omit some add to learn

00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:54,500
more button here as well let's add one

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,500
more card

00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:14,969
we'll add another button and we'll do

00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:18,810
one final card before Kojo hits me no

00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:25,169
hitting I mean ah approaches gently

00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:26,999
caresses maybe haha okay so I added

00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:28,819
three cards one without a button let's

00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:31,469
preview what we have so far

00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:33,630
woohoo we got some bootstrap cards so

00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:35,789
very quickly you can get up and running

00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:38,130
without having to write any models or

00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:39,779
any stream fields or any blocks and you

00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:42,029
can just start using wagtail in a way

00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:44,310
that you would normally use WordPress

00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:47,420
we got blog we got forms everything's in

00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:47,420
there so check it out

00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,630
[Applause]

00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:03,210
I my name is Sergey it's my first time a

00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:04,170
jungler come on I work at rover and

00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,230
today I would like to talk about

00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,700
onboarding new engineers if you seen

00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,440
this movie you probably know the first

00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,360
rule of Fight Club is you do not talk

00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:16,190
about Fight Club so is the second rule

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:21,330
but what's the eighth rule of Fight Club

00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:23,190
anyone that's right if it's your first

00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,920
night at Fight Club you have to fight so

00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:28,560
at Rover if it's your first day as a

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,880
software engineer you will code and

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:40,860
shift production why some people might

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:43,080
ask I think it's cool and it's rewarding

00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,450
and it's exciting if you like me

00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,090
software engineer you like to code so

00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:51,150
that's why you got this job not to fill

00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:53,850
HR paperwork not to configure your

00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:56,420
environment all day but you you codon

00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:58,950
you ship and you see results right away

00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:02,010
and you also get a familiar with the

00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:04,320
code and with the process and it's also

00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,760
not rewarding not rewarding not only for

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,700
you but it's rewarding for the whole

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,160
team this is a screenshot from slack

00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,440
some what did they first deploy see the

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,230
reaction from the whole team everybody

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,940
happy so what about the initial

00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,550
environment setup you still have to do

00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:24,000
it

00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:25,740
configuration credentials installing

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,450
dependencies yes you still have to do it

00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,700
that's why you have documentation you

00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:31,830
have to document the process and if you

00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,420
documented it chances are you can

00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,780
automate it so you can skip the whole

00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:38,100
thing if somebody's really curious how

00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:40,500
like what it's doing they can always

00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,570
look of course you have your favorite

00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,880
IDE but if it's your favorite IDE you

00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:47,010
know already how to set it up so you can

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,590
do it quickly get done with all this

00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:52,440
stuff and get to code is it risky of

00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:54,600
course it is risky you you have a person

00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,610
who doesn't know much about your system

00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,440
shipping the code on the first day but

00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,510
guess what somebody who's been with the

00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:06,300
company since beginning can also ship

00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:08,100
code that will break everything so we

00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,270
need to minimize the risk we have to

00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,730
build our process or

00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:13,650
so that there is less risk and how to do

00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:15,840
it you start with a small ticket small I

00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:18,180
mean no just lines of code but actually

00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:21,360
the scope like it could be like a text

00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,430
change it could be like like a link

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,110
change it could be like you remove one

00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:29,070
unused function or you refactor a

00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:31,320
function use commit hooks this will help

00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:33,510
you quickly find things like really

00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:37,050
small things like if your code doesn't

00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:41,700
comply with the coding standard use

00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:43,770
automated continues the C ICD so our C

00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,680
ICD pipeline is about 15 minutes from

00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:49,380
the merge till your code shows up in

00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,960
production but before you merge it we're

00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:54,300
gonna run the tests on on your committee

00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,530
so every commit triggers a build and we

00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:59,100
run all the tests and for that you have

00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:03,030
to have the test we have over 30,000

00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:05,010
tests and with an 89% coverage so we're

00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:08,760
not hundred percent but with trying to

00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:15,570
get there do code reviews if you don't

00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:17,670
do it just do it and you have to have

00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,290
monitoring in place so after all this

00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:23,910
after all these tests and all the code

00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:25,560
reviews bugs and defects can still make

00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,630
it into production you have to have a

00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,400
system in place where something will

00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:33,180
trigger an alarm and something will tell

00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:35,220
you okay stuff is broken and there are

00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,390
two kinds of monitoring there it's kind

00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,970
of like DevOps

00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:41,010
sort of monitoring where you know like

00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:43,260
your endpoint is all of a sudden became

00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,240
slow or there are too many queries

00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:48,600
running and there are also business

00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,340
metrics kind of monitoring where all

00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,700
tests are passing everything is fine

00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:55,830
your endpoints are much faster but all

00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,260
of a sudden you have half as many

00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:01,740
bookings so maybe that's why everything

00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:04,350
fast and you have to have the ability to

00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,330
quickly undo the change and it's not

00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,760
just delivered but it would be very nice

00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:10,650
and we do have it to roll back to the

00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,750
quick to the previous build like I

00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:15,060
mentioned before the CI CD pipeline

00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,770
takes about 15 minutes but sometimes we

00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,710
need just instant go back to the

00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:21,240
previous state of the world so you fixed

00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,800
a small ticket on the first day now what

00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,300
do you know everything

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,420
of course you don't that's why we have

00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,459
more more onboarding things we have a

00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,140
formal onboarding program which lasts

00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:33,120
for days and spread over two weeks and

00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,890
it does not start on the first day we

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,899
have formal pair programming program

00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:39,600
where you matched with an experienced

00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:43,380
programmer experienced internals in

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,420
terms of tenure at rover and once one

00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,490
hour per week you just spend working

00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,620
together on a ticket and we have team

00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:52,019
rotations so in conclusion I would like

00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,029
to say like if you want your engineers

00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:56,190
to be effective productive and get up to

00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:58,560
speed quickly just put some effort into

00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:00,899
your onboarding program and if you want

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,090
to experience all this firsthand Rover

00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:09,119
is hiring

00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:09,119
[Applause]

00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,209
all right so hi everyone thank you for

00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:16,009
have

00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:17,540
here today I'm Dan Taylor I'm a program

00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:19,550
manager for our Python developer tools

00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,379
at Microsoft and I saw some people

00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:23,509
struggling with running Python on

00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:25,220
Windows yesterday at the conference I

00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:26,720
was motivated to come up here and share

00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,480
with you some tips about running Python

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,980
on Windows and also as I've wanted to

00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,769
show you how to use Visual Studio code

00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,790
with Python on Windows because a lot of

00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:35,990
people are interested in doing that

00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,230
these days and it happens to work

00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:40,579
particularly well so why do we care so

00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,959
coach I just mentioned that you

00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,879
surprised by how many people use Python

00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:45,290
on Windows so if you look at the Python

00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:47,360
Software Foundation survey actually

00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:49,759
about half of Python developers are

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,559
using Windows now not half of people in

00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,269
this room are using Windows so it's a

00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:55,550
good reason for me to come up here and

00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:57,139
share with you a few tips so how do you

00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,999
use Python on Windows first you need to

00:14:57,139 --> 00:15:01,429
install it so to install Python on

00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:03,410
Windows go to python org slash downloads

00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:04,879
and so there's a number of things you

00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:07,670
can click on this page i like to click

00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,990
on the download link down here and i'll

00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,769
show you why in a minute now the other

00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:13,029
thing you could do is you can go to

00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:15,439
python org and you can click the latest

00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:16,670
download link there and then after you

00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:18,860
click that link you're given a list of

00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:20,600
options to choose from don't worry

00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,189
there's there's about you know eight

00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,350
different options for windows go for the

00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:26,299
executable installer and in particular I

00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,649
like to pick 64-bit because I've run

00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:30,170
into many situations where I'm doing

00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:32,540
data analysis on Windows and I run out

00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:34,819
of or not a bad rest space with a 32-bit

00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,559
version so after you do that what

00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:38,509
happens okay we get this nice

00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:41,149
installation prompt which says Install

00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:42,799
Now and if you click the customize

00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:45,139
installation just a pro tip you can

00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,670
install the debugging symbols for the

00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:50,059
Python installer which allows you to do

00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:52,220
cross language C++ and Python debugging

00:15:50,059 --> 00:15:53,149
if you have Visual Studio I'm not going

00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,339
to show that today but there's another

00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:56,749
talk you can watch on that one thing you

00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:59,809
might be tempted to check that box that

00:15:56,749 --> 00:16:00,230
says add Python 3.7 to the path no don't

00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:01,699
do that

00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,199
why because you might have multiple

00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:04,129
versions of Python installed and then

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,689
you're going to be messing with your

00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,889
path to try and get them to work so I'll

00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:09,019
show you some tips about how to deal

00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:10,339
with that in a minute now before we move

00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:12,439
on a couple other helpful things you

00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:13,579
might want to install get for Windows so

00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:16,249
get for Windows gives you everything you

00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:19,249
need you to do source code control and

00:16:16,249 --> 00:16:21,499
it also includes a get bash prompt which

00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:22,819
lets you do familiar things like RM and

00:16:21,499 --> 00:16:24,769
LS and all sorts of things that you

00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:25,120
might be doing out of habit when working

00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:27,550
with

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,470
- and then after you go there go to code

00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,690
Digital Studio comm and hit the bright

00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,860
green download button which gets UVs

00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,810
code and there's a number of different

00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,250
extensions for yes code the Python

00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:38,110
extension is the fastest-growing

00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,880
extension in the most popular extension

00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:42,010
in the visual studio code marketplace

00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,830
visual studio code is extremely popular

00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:46,120
with Python developers so we're for

00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,500
Python developers you get all sorts of

00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,850
things like intellisense linting

00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,170
debugging room factoring unit testing

00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,620
last year source control at your

00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:54,550
integration and docker support and then

00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,589
that's a set enough I'm going to go

00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:59,800
right into a demo so you've got a

00:16:56,589 --> 00:17:01,690
command prompt on Windows let's go right

00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:06,130
into that my mouse is jumping all over

00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:08,290
the place there we go okay tiny little

00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,709
font first thing we want to do is

00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:16,480
increase that font size go to properties

00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:17,890
there font 36 wonderful alright so the

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,900
first thing I would like to do Python

00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:21,280
launch or py that launches whatever

00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,620
version of Python you have installed and

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,329
it tries to pick the best one if I type

00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,800
PI - 0 it shows me all the verses of

00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:29,740
Python I have installed so if I were on

00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,450
run Python - I typed PI - - I get python

00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:35,559
- isn't that wonderful if I want to run

00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:38,860
Python 3 point 7 32 bit I do PI - 3.7 -

00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:40,660
32 and now I'm running Python 3.7 32-bit

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:45,130
awesome now I want to create a virtual

00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:47,370
environment PI - 3 - M then we're gonna

00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:49,780
run the VINs module and then create a

00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:51,940
virtual environment called my end so

00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,200
what's happening here this is creating a

00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,360
virtual environment it's creating a copy

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,340
of the Python runtime with a copy of the

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,450
site packages so that you can start with

00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,790
an environment that has the exact

00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:02,200
business of Python that you want as well

00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:05,800
as installed just the packages that you

00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:08,050
want to get started once you have that

00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,580
Miami installed I'll switch over to

00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:12,640
another command line here you can see n

00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,710
scripts activate - then activate that

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,950
virtual environment and then I can type

00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:19,950
code dot - open visual studio code Cujo

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:22,120
is gonna give me a hug anytime now

00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:26,020
alright now that we're in Visual Studio

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,730
code I can open a Python file I've

00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,860
already installed the Python extension

00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,929
and there's a few different things that

00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,610
I get with that my virtual environment

00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:35,110
shows up in the command line or in the

00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,730
status bar I can click that and I can

00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,990
switch between other virtual

00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:38,620
environments or other Python and

00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,090
anaconda

00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,890
other installations I want to use I can

00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:43,420
install pilant but I'm going to forget

00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:46,930
that for now I just want to show you

00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:49,780
that in intellisense works here there

00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:52,900
and if you want a debug we can click add

00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:58,090
configurations here and we can debug

00:18:52,900 --> 00:19:00,490
this using Django in a minute and I

00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:04,330
click with the Django button press play

00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:07,030
and we're off and running so obviously I

00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:08,559
didn't get through all of that but just

00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:11,320
so you know there's also you can run

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,030
Python on Ubuntu on Windows if you type

00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,960
ubuntu until your Start menu prompt it's

00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,730
still a Bunter you follow the

00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,160
instructions and there you go thank you

00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:20,520
so much there's my Twitter slides have a

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,520
great day

00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,170
hi I'm Noah and I'm here to talk about

00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,790
what all of these words means a DevOps

00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,290
la sorry I'm no I work for right cell

00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,400
moving on don't have much time

00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,810
if you've been on one of my talks before

00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,920
I talk of my element and I'm definitely

00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:39,250
into that here so what's a virtual

00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,660
machine close to the mic okay

00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,770
what's a virtual machine virtual

00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,910
machines are running on simulated

00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:45,100
Hardware these days it's not usually

00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:46,840
actually simulated but close enough what

00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,520
does a VM image this is the disk that is

00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,840
going to be part of a virtual machine in

00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,390
the future so it's all the files that

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,650
will go into a future virtual machine

00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,910
vagrant bit old-school now but it's a

00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:57,600
tool for making local development

00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,600
virtual machines

00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:03,730
I'm skipping slides cloud is someone

00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,800
else's computers usually located

00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:08,950
somewhere in Virginia a TBS is the most

00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:11,950
popular cloud vendor ec2 is the Amazon

00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:13,810
product for virtual machines as three is

00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:16,060
their Amazon product for file storage or

00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:17,440
one of them CloudFormation is the Amazon

00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,810
product for managing other Amazon

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,340
products terraform is like cloud

00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,870
formation stead of just for Amazon it's

00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:25,600
for lots of clouds and it does a lot

00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:27,700
more stuff probably use terraform GCE is

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,110
Google's cloud and Azure is Microsoft's

00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,480
cloud yes you can run Linux on Azure

00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:33,040
it's quite nice OpenStack is like a

00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,670
cloud except you also have to run it

00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,130
yourself

00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:37,870
a container is a cool way to run a

00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:39,160
process all it is is a process with a

00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,930
bunch of security flags so that your

00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,400
process can't see certain things on the

00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:44,680
system that's it that's all a container

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,180
is I promise a container image is the

00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,800
larval form of a container so it's a

00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,360
tarball containing all of the files that

00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,010
will go into a future container it's

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,830
like a VM image is all the files will go

00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:55,360
into a future VM doctor doctor doctor is

00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:58,090
not the only way to make containers but

00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,280
it is the most common a docker file are

00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:02,290
the steps to make a docker image which

00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,030
use docker build to actually turn into a

00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:06,430
docker image or other tools but usually

00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:09,430
docker build there's a great talk

00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:10,450
yesterday by Graham on kubernetes check

00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,530
out the video if you didn't see it

00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,670
because I'm not gonna go over it in

00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,830
nearly that much detail because I have

00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:16,270
three minutes left

00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:18,070
swarm was docker its internal attempt at

00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:19,930
making a multi server container thingy

00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:21,160
but kubernetes is a lot more popular so

00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:23,860
probably don't use docker swarm anymore

00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,840
sorry to anyone that likes it composes

00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,310
the much smaller case so just if you

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,780
have a couple of containers on one

00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,940
server and you want to manage the just

00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,960
those docker compose

00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,460
orchestration is a general term for all

00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,630
of those things like kubernetes impose

00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,840
for coordinating a whole bunch of

00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,890
containers into doing something useful

00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,810
resource scheduling is speaking

00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:42,850
how to place a container on multiple

00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:44,170
servers so you have constraints like I

00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,370
have this much RAM available on this

00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,630
much server and this much on the other

00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,150
server where do I put my container

00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:52,150
that's resource scheduling serverless or

00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:53,950
functions of service or AWS lambda it's

00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:55,480
a way to write api to less boilerplate

00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,490
that's basically it

00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,990
some of them expose things like if you

00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,880
write a single function it'll expose it

00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:02,920
as a REST API some of them are just if

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,690
you've got a Django app I'll expose that

00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,610
easily but all into that general

00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,740
category of less boilerplate because who

00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,060
likes boilerplate ci does not mean

00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,590
continuous integration any more I don't

00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,090
know anyone other than Microsoft that

00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,650
still actually continuously integrates

00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:17,890
it means continuous testing but we still

00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:19,630
call it C I for some reason pipelines

00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:21,970
are a way to organize complex test

00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:24,790
environments test Suites test stuff in

00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:26,560
general for your CI system Jenkins is

00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:28,620
the most popular of the CI tools

00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,580
although it's a bit cranky at this point

00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:32,230
Travis is a newer one you'll probably

00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:34,440
see it in a lot of open source projects

00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:36,340
because it's free for open source

00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,020
continuous delivery or continuous

00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:40,660
deployment just means if the tests pass

00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:42,070
it goes out to production exactly what

00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:45,100
that means can vary depending on the

00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:47,560
environment but something like that big

00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,940
data I use 10 terabytes as the threshold

00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,830
but in general it's trying to run a

00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:53,680
query on more data than fits in any one

00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:55,210
of your servers Hadoop is a very popular

00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,070
set of tools for running big data

00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:58,990
queries and spark in particular if you

00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:00,490
see that one is a thing that is used a

00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,350
lot for running the queries themselves

00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:04,840
OOP also includes stuff for like storing

00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:06,820
big data and all that kind of thing ETL

00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:09,220
extract transform load is a name of a

00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:11,140
pattern used in big data for extracting

00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:13,240
data from usually a relational Postgres

00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,800
my sequel whatever database transforming

00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,210
it in some way with MapReduce and then

00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:21,580
loading it back into an analysis

00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:23,860
database switching gears to security in

00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,750
my last 60 seconds InfoSec is keeping

00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,570
your data safe black hats are the bad

00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:30,520
people white hats are the good people

00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:32,800
red team are the people that are doing

00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,420
attacking and offensive things but they

00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,730
have permission they are good people

00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:38,800
that are doing it for the benefit of

00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:40,720
everyone blue team are the defenders and

00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,790
purple team or people that do both and

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,500
very quickly a hash is a one-way

00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,420
function so given the output you cannot

00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,010
find the input whereas encryption is

00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:50,950
reversible but only if you have the

00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:52,090
right key and thank you very much if you

00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:54,150
have any questions come find me

00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,150
you

00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:04,190
I'm just really impressed by the

00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,990
organizers I've organized non-technical

00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:07,669
events of several hunger people I know

00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:09,260
how much work goes into this process so

00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:11,110
just thank you very much for putting

00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,700
such a welcoming event together

00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:15,020
so I'll introduced Lorne super more very

00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,870
briefly for those that aren't familiar

00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:20,660
we are a multi program national security

00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:22,580
laboratory we work on national security

00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,860
needs for the United States we also work

00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:27,350
on fundamental science research and so a

00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:29,750
lot of different areas coming together

00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:31,520
Kojo mentioned what is it that Livermore

00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:34,059
labs does I don't even know everything

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:37,280
that we do we have 7,000 employees and

00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:37,549
countless projects it's pretty fun place

00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,510
to work

00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:43,460
we're hired and so I work in the

00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:45,230
computation division I work in a

00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,299
division called application simulations

00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:49,120
inequality which works on two very

00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:51,230
different areas which is massively

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:55,040
parallel high performance computing

00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:56,630
simulations and web development and so

00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,540
what I the environmental restoration

00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:01,760
department focuses on is environmental

00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,350
remediation so cleaning up historical

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,710
contamination at the site that is

00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:09,290
developed through years of different

00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:11,630
uses that the lab has gone through and

00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:13,040
so we have an application that we call

00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:15,049
it times it's the environmental

00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,750
information management system it's a

00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:19,910
data management application support we

00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:22,220
use it for sampling monitoring analysis

00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:24,440
and reporting there's probably over a

00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:26,270
hundred individual applications within

00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,059
this suite that we've developed over

00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:31,549
quite a long period of time and so we

00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:33,830
began using ingress with C and terminal

00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:35,809
access and then began moving to Pearl

00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:40,059
which we've been using for over twenty

00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:40,059
years now and has grown to quite a large

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:48,140
development platform and so we also

00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:52,070
moved to Oracle in that same time frame

00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:53,480
and we're anticipating like

00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:55,429
environmental restoration that the lab

00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,350
is going to be around at least until

00:25:55,429 --> 00:26:01,040
2075 so I'll see you all at Jango con

00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:02,660
2075 and we wanted to move to a more

00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:06,110
sustainable platform pearl is pretty

00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:07,850
much yeah and so we have about eight

00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:10,610
developers on our development team

00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:12,700
working on Jango now and so just a

00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:15,160
high-level approach to what we're moving

00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:17,500
is we have an existing Oracle 12c

00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:19,600
database we have several hundred tables

00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:22,809
across multiple schemas we're using

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,630
Django 111 right now we've integrated it

00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:28,030
with Active Directory resources love the

00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:30,670
Django rest framework it's an excellent

00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:32,170
tool we love it a lot one of the biggest

00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:33,820
improvements for us in our development

00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:36,040
histories were moving to unit testing

00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:38,559
and removing to functional testing and

00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:41,799
continuous integration which I've

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:46,179
learned just recently maybe not means

00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:47,710
what I think it is and so the primary

00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:51,760
technologies that we're using right now

00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:54,059
are like Python Django kendo UI just a

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,350
smattering and so one of the goals of

00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:58,120
coming to django con for me was to just

00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:59,860
meet people I really wanted to network

00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,540
and I really wanted to see how many

00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:04,059
different projects there were using

00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:05,290
Django and so I just wanted to give this

00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:07,240
opportunity to kind of share a little

00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:09,309
bit about what we've done as well and

00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:12,400
maybe prompt some conversations in the

00:27:09,309 --> 00:27:13,960
hall afterwards and so I'll talk a

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,910
little bit about why we decided to go

00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,500
this route is it's it's a little bit of

00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:20,980
a challenge finding perl developers it's

00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:24,010
gone pretty similarly to COBOL it's

00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:26,530
getting a little hard and Python is very

00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:28,690
popular it's easy to read maintain we

00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:30,400
love developing in it the data science

00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,929
support is excellent although we have

00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,640
this application suite we also have a

00:27:31,929 --> 00:27:36,580
wide variety of scientists developing

00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,080
their own data science scripts and so

00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,970
it's very easy to integrate that

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,470
together with what we have we're

00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:45,790
developing applications much more

00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:47,620
quickly love the RM in moving away from

00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:49,540
some extremely complex equals that I

00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:52,540
have spent days trying to understand

00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,280
what they did and the plugins and really

00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:56,890
the community like I love the community

00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:59,710
here it's been excellent to learn from

00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:01,450
different people and some of the biggest

00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:02,890
challenges we faced and so I'm not sure

00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:04,690
if this is the same for everyone is we

00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:06,190
had to bring our database with us and so

00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:07,840
we have several hundred tables and so a

00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:10,000
lot of problems that we've run into are

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,710
just supporting the legacy side of

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,830
things that are unmanaged and so we've

00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:18,220
had some permissions kind of come up

00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:19,330
there and but overall Jenga has been

00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:21,669
excellent so I just want to take this

00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,720
opportunity to share what we do and so

00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:28,970
thank you

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,970
[Applause]

00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:36,380
I was surprised to see how emoji

00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:38,900
friendly this was so I thought I would

00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:42,680
put up my favorite emoji while I was

00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:46,040
doing this because I also am 99% demo 0%

00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:49,490
slides 1% emoji so what I want to talk

00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:53,030
about is a little django app that my

00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:54,770
team built a couple weeks ago on wow day

00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:56,150
which has work on us wednesday when we

00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:59,210
try and make stuff that makes our lives

00:28:56,150 --> 00:29:01,340
easier our issue was that we were having

00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:04,820
a hard time between front-end and

00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:06,500
back-end describing our requirements for

00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:10,280
data structures that needed to pass

00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:15,680
between them so we would have some nice

00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:18,050
like ux mock-ups from sketch or balsamic

00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,550
but that didn't always translate 100% to

00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:22,010
what was possible in the backend

00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:23,870
not to mention that um sometimes it

00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:26,380
wasn't really self-evident we have a

00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:28,430
group of front-end developers who have

00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:30,620
experience working with the django

00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:34,220
templating language so they really like

00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:36,140
designing in browser themselves but they

00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,640
don't always have the models that they

00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,340
need access to when we're developing a

00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,710
new feature so what would start to

00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:44,360
happen is they would ask us for like

00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:46,310
sort of a vague thing and we would build

00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,330
like seed them a branch that had a piece

00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,770
of it and then they would start

00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:50,300
designing in browser and then they would

00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:52,100
be like wait I need this other thing and

00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,240
then we were like oh we were working on

00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,950
something else like we'll get back to

00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:58,550
you later and anyways there's just a lot

00:29:54,950 --> 00:30:01,010
of communication issues so what we came

00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:03,460
up with was a bit of an easier way for

00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:06,560
them to kind of just do that themselves

00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:09,770
basically we developed this little

00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:13,040
django app called easy django mock-ups

00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:16,190
that you can use to basically if you put

00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:19,010
your HTML files which can use whatever

00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:20,840
django template of in this folder

00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:21,980
mock-ups or configure it yourself where

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,420
you say it's going to be in your

00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,640
templates wherever your template loader

00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:28,490
is going to find it then we will

00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:31,010
automatically go find where that is and

00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:32,270
render it for you at this mock-up slash

00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:35,960
whatever the name of your template is

00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:38,660
and URI and then you can see the thing

00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,090
that you made so one other thing that we

00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:42,950
included is that you can add a JSON file

00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:44,790
that's named after the same thing so you

00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:48,210
can arbitrarily build out

00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:51,210
data structure Justin JSON that you can

00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:54,210
then access in this case I have the this

00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:56,550
year things key with this list of thing

00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:58,200
one thing to you named but you can see

00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:59,670
that I'm just iterating over that here

00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,250
as if like I had received this in the

00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:03,780
context and this way the front-end

00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:05,880
developers can just totally do this

00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:08,280
themselves they already know you know

00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,570
how to write develop JSON so we don't

00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,670
have to do any of this back and forth

00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:14,100
and then once they're done with that

00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:16,320
project they can kind of show us this

00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,700
and now we have something to take sort

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,310
to the backend and build out all of the

00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,570
other stuff in terms of models and then

00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:24,840
we can just sort of plug that into that

00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:26,610
template that already exists so a little

00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,980
bit about the thing itself which were in

00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:33,030
the process of pulling out of our

00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:34,500
monolithic Jenko codebase for the

00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:37,100
purposes of open sourcing it and also

00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:39,600
has an experiment for ourselves to make

00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:41,550
django apps separately so we could also

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,580
break up our real monolithic one

00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:46,920
privately sometime but yeah it's pretty

00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:49,800
it's pretty simple will peel off

00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:53,640
whatever this URL has to say to drawing

00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:56,640
trying go detective files are named and

00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:59,550
these JSON files are named in our view

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,890
here we have some stuff to sort of check

00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:03,990
where your mock-ups directory is or if

00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:06,030
you want to see JSON errors propagated

00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:08,190
to the front end we're using the Django

00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:11,730
messaging framework so for example if I

00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:14,790
go back up here and mess up my JSON a

00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:17,670
little bit so messed up

00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:19,770
then over here kind of surface some of

00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:21,180
that here for the front end and just

00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:23,130
trying to take advantage of some Django

00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:25,050
stuff that already exists to make that

00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:27,990
like totally like a browser in browser

00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:29,730
experience as much as possible but yeah

00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:32,850
basically just detecting some stuff

00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:34,410
there in our views you know we

00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:36,660
abstracted it away a little bit to this

00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:38,490
mock-up object but basically can go use

00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:40,980
all that stuff it's figured out to

00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:42,380
render what this request is with the

00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:52,820
template that should be named after

00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:55,170
whatever the URI is and be okay and the

00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:57,280
JSON file that's named the same so yeah

00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:59,650
just trying to make a little magical

00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:02,110
in conclusion I learned that there's

00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:03,970
other types of ghosts emojis and I

00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:05,320
decided that the Samsung one is my

00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:07,570
number two but my Apple one is still a

00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:13,059
number one that's it

00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:13,059
[Applause]

00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:25,449
so my name is allod silvering also first

00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:27,609
time here enjoying it very much I would

00:33:25,449 --> 00:33:30,909
like to thank my company for bringing me

00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:35,079
here I'm a developer at u.s. news it's a

00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:38,169
news company that does rankings and the

00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:40,239
DC area and you guys for coming and

00:33:38,169 --> 00:33:44,909
hearing and seeing and talking and

00:33:40,239 --> 00:33:48,609
drinking and whatnot was fun alright so

00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:51,190
what is a Chrome extension so very

00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:53,799
shortly to put it a Chrome extension is

00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:56,829
actually something that interacts with

00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:58,539
your browser activity that you want to

00:33:56,829 --> 00:34:01,329
customize so if you want to do something

00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:03,819
different other than what your browser

00:34:01,329 --> 00:34:06,339
would normally do on the page and

00:34:03,819 --> 00:34:11,529
there's tons of them the number one I

00:34:06,339 --> 00:34:13,389
think is they add blocker yeah I have no

00:34:11,529 --> 00:34:17,049
idea what the number two is but I think

00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:21,669
everyone has a blocker so what do you

00:34:17,049 --> 00:34:27,129
need to start you need to know basic CSS

00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:31,599
JavaScript and HTML that's the next talk

00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:34,000
in five minutes okay have an idea create

00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:37,779
a manifest file which is kind of a

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:42,179
settings file for Chrome browser create

00:34:37,779 --> 00:34:42,179
the UI and the JavaScript functionality

00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:49,509
what's your idea you need to do

00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:54,460
something fun you need to do something

00:34:49,509 --> 00:34:56,710
that's usable and if this is not like

00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:59,890
for learning purposes you should do

00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:01,599
something that solves a problem and keep

00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:04,359
in mind that list is more and that's

00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:06,579
also a good thing to keep in mind when

00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:10,930
you're developing anything whether it's

00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:14,650
Python Jango JavaScript HTML these

00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:19,630
things should always be on in your mind

00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:22,660
when developing in my opinion so this is

00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:25,269
a manifest file and we'll go shortly

00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:26,820
through it the version is gonna be two

00:35:25,269 --> 00:35:30,150
that's like the

00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:32,430
extension framework version you're gonna

00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:34,980
give it a name description this is

00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:37,410
actually what would pop up when you open

00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:40,320
the extension page and that's gonna be

00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:43,440
the description it's kind of like SEO

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:46,290
for your site so this is all the tags

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:49,230
and Adwords and where you use your where

00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:51,480
the images coming from also this is

00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:54,390
where you ask permissions from you the

00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:58,200
users so you can take control like the

00:35:54,390 --> 00:36:02,190
camera the microphone and whatever the

00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:04,380
UI this is basic HTML CSS all packed

00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:06,360
into one slide so you can just copy

00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:09,090
paste it by the way this is all you can

00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:11,610
copy paste it but in the manifest dot

00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:15,860
JSON this is exactly what I did copy

00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:19,410
pasted this put it in in pop-up HTML

00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:22,200
then I copy pasted this is the actual

00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:25,890
JavaScript I also added a JavaScript

00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:30,660
file that was just jQuery and this is

00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:33,810
what's actually happening so in short

00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:39,150
I'm taking a CSS style and adding it to

00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:43,740
each anchor tag that's between one and

00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:46,550
ten words letters sorry the hard part

00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:52,460
the point you have to drag extension

00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:57,440
into browser yeah so this is the

00:36:52,460 --> 00:37:00,330
extension page I don't have the correct

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,980
permission so for some reason I can do

00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:05,420
it but you can see you can drop to

00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:10,080
install since my do the work I have to

00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:15,510
load it for whatever reason and that's

00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:17,730
it I have it now we try it out so this

00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:19,920
is a wiki with link apparently yes

00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:21,930
there's a wiki page about buffalo

00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:27,510
Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo Buffalo

00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:32,240
buffalo and this is what it does makes

00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:32,240
your anchor tags jump very useful

00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:34,390
you

00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,990
so sometimes authentication is like oh

00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,520
you put this thing this line inside your

00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:51,040
code and then magically you have at

00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:54,070
indication running but there's an inch

00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,990
in there because sometimes we don't test

00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:58,000
every single page that we had like if

00:37:55,990 --> 00:38:00,220
you Ray was in normal education just a

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,430
token authentication for has framework

00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:05,460
API and you start to create groups of

00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:08,650
users and then you need to assure that

00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:11,080
certain group should only see some views

00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:14,010
and then it's cast Google group as soon

00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:18,070
as your project is starting to grow up

00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:20,440
sometimes no one or want some dumb

00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:26,820
wasn't that time someone is reviewing

00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:32,470
your PR or something it may be not that

00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:34,720
like well how can I say that not though

00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:36,850
not that good to review your code and

00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,940
sometimes some of you can pass through

00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:41,710
the reviewing process in the code you be

00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:44,280
deployed and will be a leak on your

00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:47,740
endpoint API rest framework or something

00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:50,080
sometime you need to q8 this and it to

00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:51,880
assure that every view is ok is having

00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:55,690
permissions and authentication and stuff

00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:58,270
I had that to QA and any point and then

00:38:55,690 --> 00:39:00,310
I was all view per view in looking out

00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:03,370
this permission is wrong like ok these

00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:06,580
premonitions are only to fix it but if

00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:08,110
the project's is bigger it's not

00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:11,320
sustainable anymore and you need to

00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:14,170
programmatically do that yeah sometimes

00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:18,040
means usually almost every time because

00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:20,560
we are humans and what I did was this I

00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:24,340
create a common for a general manager

00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:27,190
and then you can pass an app it's nice

00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:30,400
because you can use third-party apps

00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:32,470
like cast off and then you can see rich

00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,360
holes they had in their code because if

00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:37,390
you are using this group of users

00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:39,280
they just do regular education so it's

00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:40,830
kind of little enemy to extend the video

00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,080
and fix it by yourself

00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:47,020
ok what's the risk outcome of death you

00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:49,690
have the view name from your file and

00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:51,850
which permissions we are using which is

00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:54,400
nice we can get some workmen information

00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,860
from it like authentication class is

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,950
that you

00:39:54,860 --> 00:40:00,140
using parent classes that near here it's

00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:02,510
from this like some Christian permission

00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:05,870
eater it's from other permission classes

00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:08,120
that should have holes in there soon so

00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:09,680
their codes like really ugly because

00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:13,550
it's make it to work as a proof of

00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:15,650
concept but we are using in this Cal

00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:18,800
common show where he rallies from the

00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:21,140
top third part Libre called Jen

00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,420
extensions which is awesome in the

00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:25,670
anyway I went to each end point for any

00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:28,100
point in get the view and front of you

00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:30,860
get the permission classes in play just

00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:35,300
print it so it's really a 10-minute job

00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:38,330
so it's awesome okay you can stall it if

00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:40,280
you wanted to use in your young project

00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:43,070
but in fact you can because I didn't

00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:45,980
apply it yet by PI so you can use it use

00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:49,790
it use it really use it but I have a

00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:53,930
bitly that you can grab the snippet that

00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:55,880
I wrote and a nice think that it's

00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:58,250
really easy to use it because it's just

00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:00,740
a one common line and probably should be

00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:03,560
a check like fire to put in your

00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:05,750
continuous integration stack like Oh run

00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:07,790
the Python Manoj Bajpai manager dot PI

00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:10,190
Shack and it will check for the

00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:12,790
permission Co this view has no

00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:16,550
permission at all so it really should be

00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:19,520
open as it is like a log in then the

00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:22,370
point or not so that's what I did one in

00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,050
the morning and in fact I did in this

00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:26,630
morning because I lost the disco Daryl

00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:27,710
wrote back then and then I will rewrote

00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:31,580
it but it's okay

00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:34,490
and thank you obrigado it's from brazil
