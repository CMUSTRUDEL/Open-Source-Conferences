	DjangoCon US 2018 - It's about time by Russell Keith-Magee

Hereâ€™s a fun experiment: Mention timezones within earshot of any experienced programmer. Now wait until the profanity stops.

Handling dates and time is an incredibly common requirement in computer applications. Thatâ€™s hardly surprising - we all use computers to record when we did old things, track how long things take, and to plan when weâ€™re going to do things. So why is dealing with time so difficult?

Well, itâ€™s because time has a very sordid history. What we even think of as time has changed. In this talk, youâ€™ll travel through time, and see the impact that two thousand years of history have had on our modern life. Youâ€™ll be shown how all this wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey history stuff affects the data modelling and APIs we use on a daily basis.

This is going to take someâ€¦ time.
