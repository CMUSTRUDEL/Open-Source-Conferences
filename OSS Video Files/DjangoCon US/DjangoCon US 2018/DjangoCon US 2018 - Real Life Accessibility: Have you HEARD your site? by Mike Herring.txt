	DjangoCon US 2018 - Real Life Accessibility: Have you HEARD your site? by Mike Herring

In the past it was simpler and easier to think of building websites exclusively for desktop monitors capable of showing 1024x768 pixels, sitting on the desk of a non-impaired, English-speaking person. But today we need to embrace a much broader range of users. And one part of this is designing sites for the visually impaired.

There are automatic checkers that you can use to assess your siteâ€™s accessibility. It will tell you that all your images need an alt tag, and that the H2 should come after the H1. This is a good start, but even if you dot all your iâ€™s and cross all your tâ€™s and get 100% pass, your site may be an unnavigable mess in practice.

In this talk we will look at and listen to real world examples of websites that either pass or fail the accessibility test. We will hear anecdotes from actual visually impaired users and discover how they navigate the web. And we will see that even though frameworks like Django can set us up for success, itâ€™s up to us as developers to follow through.

[Music]

00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:20,670
yeah thank you very much welcome to the

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,560
last session of talks and everyone's

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,939
tired and tired of hearing talks so

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,279
thanks for sticking it out all the way

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,840
to the end with me as we said this is

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:30,119
real-life accessibility have you heard

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,640
your site and we're gonna get into what

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,520
exactly that means in a little bit first

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,780
a brief introduction my name said is

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,640
Mike herring I'm from Boston

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,440
Massachusetts and I work in a company

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,239
called American well we are a telehealth

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,250
provider you might have seen our

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,030
competitors out in the hall doctor and

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,680
demand so hey guys how's it going and

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,230
you can reach me in any of these places

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,199
unfortunately I don't do Twitter I've

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,719
tried I'm sorry I can't do it but any of

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,609
those work just fine so I consider

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,270
myself somewhat of an accessibility

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:04,799
expert but this wasn't always the case

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,060
years ago just like most of you I was

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,369
working professionally as a web

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,850
developer and knew next to nothing about

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:14,490
accessibility okay so it wasn't that

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,229
long ago and I really wouldn't call

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,689
myself an expert I'm learning just like

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,310
everyone else but the good thing is I

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:21,960
can say it's a lot easier than you might

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,250
think it is and it doesn't take that

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,369
much effort to make meaningful

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,590
improvements in your web content so what

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:29,549
why does accessibility matter and I'd

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,390
like to start this off with a little

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:35,009
quote he stands like a statue becomes

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,530
part of the Machine feeling all the

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,600
bumpers always playing clean how do you

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,390
think he does it I don't know what makes

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,579
him so good this of course is from

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,840
pinball wizard by the WHO and I was

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,340
listening to this in the car on Monday

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,290
on the way downtown to get some beers

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,490
and I was thinking yeah how does he do

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,579
it if you're not familiar with the story

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:56,100
this song is about a blind and deaf boy

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,560
named Tommy who's able to become a

00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,000
pinball champion how is he able to do

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,590
this well if you listen to the song it

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,750
spells it out for you he's able to use

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,790
tactile response he's able to feel the

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,530
vibrations in the machine feel the

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,700
impact of the bumpers and know where the

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,280
ball is at all times

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,840
and I thought this is incredible what an

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:18,190
amazing accessible piece of 1960

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,980
technology so quick quick little side

00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,959
notes who in here and I'm assuming most

00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,360
people has built a website or manages a

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,560
website okay most people because we're

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,720
Django developers right okay

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,519
no wait keep your hands up now keep your

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,080
hands up if you think Tommy the blind

00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:33,849
deaf boy from the song would be able to

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,470
use your website to navigate it find

00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:37,299
information as easily as someone who's

00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,310
fully sighted and yes what I thought

00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:43,239
that is the issue that we have to

00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:45,069
resolve so of course Tommy is not a real

00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:46,630
person but there are a lot of real

00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:49,000
people out there real customers real

00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:51,970
users who we do need to consider when it

00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,980
comes to accessibility as alluded to in

00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,209
a previous talk I think I got slightly

00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,069
different statistics from a different

00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:58,599
website but about twelve point eight

00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:00,549
percent of Americans have some sort of

00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:03,610
severe disability and that is a huge

00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:05,970
number not only that but according to

00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:08,290
CDC these numbers are increasing

00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,120
actually I should say I should add this

00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,590
to say these percentages are increasing

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,900
it's not just numbers increasing because

00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,329
population is increasing percentages are

00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:19,000
increasing as our population ages as we

00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:20,590
as our life expectancy grows we have a

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,549
higher percentage of senior citizens and

00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,019
right along with that

00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:24,069
we have a higher number of people who

00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:27,730
are suffering from some sort of

00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:29,889
disability the CDC estimates around

00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,810
three percent of Americans are legally

00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:33,099
blind and that number could double to

00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,989
almost six percent in the next three

00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:37,480
decades that is a huge number of people

00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:40,060
that we might be missing out on all

00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:43,599
right gonna do another pop quiz who here

00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:46,209
in the past year or so has dealt with an

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,609
IE bug Internet Explorer right something

00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:49,780
doesn't work right in IE 11 or something

00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:52,000
lower than that right

00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:55,690
most people have I deal with it it's an

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,760
issue how many people have dilt dealt

00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,470
with an issue dealing with visual

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,060
impaired Ness right someone can't use

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,400
the sites because they can't see they

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,489
can't operate it a couple awesome great

00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,010
not as many as I 11 which is interesting

00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:10,329
because I 11 usages at 3% same number as

00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:14,829
the number of blind people in the United

00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:16,660
States I see this as a problem I don't

00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:18,669
see why we are not spending as much time

00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,220
and energy on accessibility problems as

00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:23,409
we are on ie 11 I 11 people have a

00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,210
choice they were not born using Internet

00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:27,280
Explorer they don't have a medical

00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,260
condition preventing them from switching

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,710
browsers I think we need to shift our

00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:35,860
priorities of those people who are

00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:37,530
disabled pew research indicates that 23

00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,419
percent say they never even go online

00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:42,040
and only 39 percent say that they feel

00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:44,410
confident in their ability to navigate

00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,030
and find information online we as web

00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,470
developers should be ashamed of those

00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,750
numbers and we should be doing

00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,610
everything we can to make the web a more

00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:55,060
accessible place for everyone not just

00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:57,520
people who can see in here additionally

00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,090
a survey done by web accessibility in

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,850
mind

00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:03,520
org of people who actually use assistive

00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:05,230
technology to browse the web forty-three

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,440
percent said the the biggest issue they

00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,850
face are the biggest blocker in their

00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,919
opinion to having more accessible

00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,570
content on the web is simply lack of

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,870
awareness by content providers and by

00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:18,400
web developers that's us

00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:20,560
additionally 85 percent said given the

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,360
choice between getting more accessible

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,280
content and getting more sophisticated

00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,500
assistive technology that could read and

00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,000
understand web sites they said it would

00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,470
be more helpful if we just made more

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,330
accessible content the tools they're

00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,830
using are fine it's us that is the

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:36,690
problem so we need to take this as a

00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:38,380
personal challenge do I really have to

00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,150
when I talk to people about

00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,880
accessibility often I get a lot of

00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,050
groans and the type the type of voice

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,760
that you hear when you tell someone they

00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,710
have to write more unit tests or

00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,289
documentation or they have to support ie

00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,669
11 so if you're one of those people I

00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:54,070
have two things to tell you first of all

00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:55,990
it is the right thing to do if you don't

00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:58,330
believe me please refer to yesterday's

00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:01,450
talk on ethics and engineering but also

00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:03,550
it is the law that's right you have to

00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:05,770
do this in most cases and I'm going to

00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,660
talk about US laws specifically but I

00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:10,960
know there are analogous laws in the UK

00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:12,280
and in other places in the world if

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,660
you're familiar with accessibility

00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,789
you've probably heard the phrase section

00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:19,510
508 that refers to an amendment of the

00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:21,430
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 which applies

00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,990
to all web content produced by federal

00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,600
agencies there's also the Americans with

00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:27,310
Disabilities Act of 1990 this is why we

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,289
have wheelchair accessible ramps in

00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:33,550
public buildings this also applies to

00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:35,140
websites run by businesses and according

00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,060
to all these regulations you have to

00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,310
make your web content accessible to

00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,150
disabled users you're probably thinking

00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,510
oh but do they really check

00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:46,790
serious is this yes they do hotels.com

00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:50,600
expedia.com target.com have all been the

00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:53,900
target of lawsuits related to either

00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:56,600
section 508 or the a da and your small

00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,340
business could be next it's not just the

00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,080
big players in this field I was just

00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,030
talking to someone on Monday who had a

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,040
client small business they were building

00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:06,890
a website for them they got hit by a

00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,360
lawsuit related ad a there are law firms

00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,950
out there that are actively searching

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,720
for small businesses with non-compliant

00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:15,370
websites so the moral of the story is

00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:17,360
yes be afraid they are coming for you

00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,680
alright so now if you're convinced that

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,100
you need to do something about your site

00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,530
how do you do this well the w3c is here

00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:27,350
to save the day this is the World Wide

00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:29,780
Web Consortium these are the friendly

00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:31,670
people who publish the HTML

00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,080
specifications they have a sub group

00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:35,810
called the web accessibility initiative

00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,750
or waa I who have created even more

00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:41,480
acronyms they have the WCAG or web

00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:44,090
content accessibility guidelines and w

00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,900
AI aria or accessible rich internet

00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,510
applications

00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,190
I'm gonna go briefly over both of these

00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:51,410
I don't have time to get really deep

00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:54,080
into it by but I implore you to go

00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:57,170
online and try reading them let's talk

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,300
about WCAG this is organized in four

00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:01,040
main points about web content

00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,290
accessibility your content should be

00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,150
perceivable and this means perceivable

00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:07,130
by anyone or anything

00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:09,370
this could mean providing alternatives

00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:12,590
to text that's right

00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:15,080
providing text alternatives to images to

00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:17,270
videos to audio it could also mean

00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,470
choosing a color scheme so that people

00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:21,860
with low vision or people with

00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:23,990
colorblindness can read your text did

00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,430
you know that 6% of males in the United

00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,680
States have some sort of green week

00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:29,240
colorblindness so maybe consider that

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,680
next time you validate a form and you

00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,080
switch the continue button from grey to

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,790
green that might mean nothing

00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,550
not only it doesn't need to be

00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:39,560
perceivable but it needs to be operable

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,960
and there's lots of points under this go

00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:45,200
read about it the main one is though can

00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:47,480
you operate this website using only a

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,700
keyboard not a mouse it's more difficult

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,800
than you might think your content needs

00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,230
to be understandable this seems obvious

00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,920
but if it's really complicated you

00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,810
should

00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,480
explain any acronyms you should explain

00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:01,190
complicated jargon your website should

00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,990
behave in a predictable manner you

00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,089
should tell your users what language

00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:07,490
it's in and finally it needs to be

00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:10,490
robust in this case meaning using

00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:13,130
well-formed HTML and markup using tags

00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:15,470
efficiently so that assistive technology

00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,930
can interface with it but that slide was

00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,100
kind of dry so here my pets I would like

00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,410
you to imagine though that their

00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:24,380
adorable faces are imploring you to go

00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:27,490
read the WCAG it's long it's riveting

00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:29,690
and take those guidelines to heart

00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:31,190
something buried in the guidelines is

00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,810
this phrase following the guidelines

00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:35,180
will often make your web content more

00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:37,279
useable to users in general I thought

00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:39,769
this was kind of snarky on behalf of the

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,110
WCAG authors but it's true think about

00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:44,930
it making your content easier to

00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:47,120
navigate easier to read easier easier to

00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:49,730
understand is going to help everyone not

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,260
just people with disabilities all right

00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,760
so we want to follow these guidelines

00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,329
how do we do it let's get down to the

00:09:52,760 --> 00:10:00,199
nitty-gritty let's talk about HTML 2.0

00:09:55,329 --> 00:10:02,209
this came out in 1995 it is 23 years old

00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:04,550
and we are still doing it wrong

00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:07,130
so let's talk about some things let's

00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,810
talk about alt tags if you've ever dealt

00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:11,540
with any accessibility issues you've

00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:13,880
probably gotten missing alt tag warning

00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:16,339
a thousand times please provide alt tags

00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,959
for your images this is a short piece of

00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:21,110
text that can stand in for your image

00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:22,970
and if you ask someone traditionally

00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:24,589
what's the point of this they might say

00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,930
oh it's in case your image can't load

00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:30,100
well nowadays you say oh that's not an

00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:33,260
issue I use s/3 s/3 will never go down

00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:35,240
but it's not just about not being able

00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:37,100
to load the image maybe you're just not

00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,959
going to load the image maybe you're

00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,699
using a Braille interpreter for the site

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,890
it's not going to show an image you need

00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:44,449
to have something in its place and

00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:46,339
please tell your marketing

00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:49,190
representatives to avoid stuffing this

00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:51,800
full of SEO and marketing gibberish this

00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,600
is not the place for it

00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,730
tabindex and again these are things that

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,320
have been around for a long time and are

00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:00,050
still not being used correctly tabindex

00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,519
when you reach a website you hit tab you

00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,410
can cycle through all the links and

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,270
buttons on the page tab index tells you

00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:07,699
what order to do it

00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,970
normally nowadays just set it to 0 all

00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:10,040
right

00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:12,889
that tells the browser go through it in

00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,269
order that it appears in the Dom now

00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:15,949
this is important if you're doing tricky

00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:18,350
CSS you're floating it over here you're

00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:19,730
positioning it down there tab doesn't

00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,259
care it's gonna go in the order it

00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:23,329
appears in the Dom so keep that in mind

00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:25,069
but this is necessary for people who are

00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:27,290
using a keyboard for navigation rather

00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:29,300
than a mouse you can also send it a

00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,589
negative one to skip the element why

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,009
would you do that

00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:35,209
a common example is the file upload

00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:37,279
element most people are familiar with

00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:38,660
that it's ugly you can't style it so you

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,490
move that ugly duckling off the side of

00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,959
the margin and you put a nice shiny

00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,750
image in the middle that has an on click

00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:47,120
event that fires that great but if you

00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,620
don't set the tab indexes correctly your

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,300
browser might try to focus that ugly

00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,399
duckling that's off the screen and not

00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:55,639
to the image that you really want so

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,430
make sure you set those correctly h1 to

00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:59,569
h6 this is really important if you don't

00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,470
remember anything else about this talk

00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:02,420
remember

00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,279
headings all right organize your

00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:06,889
document like a tree using headings and

00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:08,689
subheadings usually it's recommended to

00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:11,540
have one h1 that has the title of your

00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:13,759
page and don't skip levels you don't put

00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,449
it h3 under an h1 you know start your

00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:18,649
page with h2 it doesn't make any sense

00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:21,800
that same survey that I talked about

00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:23,420
before from WebM users who use assistive

00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,949
technology said the number one thing

00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:27,649
they use for navigating content is

00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:29,089
headers or headings and if they're well

00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:32,600
structured it makes it really easy to

00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:34,699
navigate so do it right before I go to

00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,920
the next slide so when the slide comes

00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:38,660
up I want everyone to look at it don't

00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,420
blink stare at it for two seconds and

00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:46,540
then we're gonna read it slowly together

00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:50,930
ready I need it yes yes okay here we go

00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:52,639
h1 doesn't mean big text please stop

00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:55,189
doing this and h6 doesn't mean small

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,500
text they have semantic meanings h1

00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:59,029
means a level one heading h6 means a

00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,160
level six heading you probably won't

00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:03,019
have a lot of those on your page please

00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,389
don't confuse these with formatting tags

00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:07,910
like bold or Center we should be

00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:10,819
avoiding using those anyways this brings

00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:13,309
me to my next topic semantic HTML this

00:13:10,819 --> 00:13:16,009
is just a fancy word for any tags in

00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:19,069
HTML that describe what an element is

00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:21,810
not how it should be displayed we use

00:13:19,069 --> 00:13:23,790
semantic hTML to avoid this

00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:25,560
condition known as div soup when you

00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,970
view the source of a page and it's just

00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,380
a div inside a div inside a div inside a

00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,990
different side div and you don't know

00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:33,840
what any of them mean well if you have

00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:36,270
CSS a user visually can see what all of

00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:39,450
those mean but you as the developer and

00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:41,880
also from an accessibility standpoint it

00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:44,790
just looks like a pile of divs so use

00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:47,730
semantic hTML mark things as headings as

00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:49,860
paragraphs use the new HTML tags for

00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,870
headers articles footers this will help

00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:54,270
the accessibility API know what to do

00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:57,300
with your page now accessibility API

00:13:54,270 --> 00:14:00,000
that is a layer that stands between your

00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,770
site and any assistive technology like a

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,380
screen reader or a Braille interpreter

00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:06,390
the accessibility API looks at your site

00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:09,089
tries to figure out where the major

00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:10,589
sections are where your content is etc

00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:13,050
and if you're using semantic tags it

00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:15,690
makes it a lot easier but there are ways

00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:17,460
to tweak it which brings me back to Aria

00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,290
talk to mention that too briefly a

00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:21,630
minute ago accessible rich Internet

00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:23,760
applications this is a set of attributes

00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:25,860
and tags you can use in your markup to

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:30,270
tell the accessibility API how to

00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:33,870
interpret it most importantly is Aria

00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:37,230
roles Aria roles are a way to basically

00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:39,330
disguise one element as another so say

00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:41,580
that file upload button we're talking

00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:44,910
about we hid the real button and we had

00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:46,800
an image that was acting as a button it

00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,480
was assuming the role of a button but we

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,860
hadn't told the accessibility API that

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,110
it was a button to it it just looked

00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,000
like an image so we need to set role

00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:56,339
equal to button in order for that to

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,170
work there are all kinds of different

00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:00,330
roles I'm not going to dive deep into it

00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:02,760
go look it up online but you can specify

00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:04,410
for instance I want to use this image as

00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,870
a section heading so set it equal to

00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:09,900
heading and set the level of the heading

00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:11,760
alerts dialogues menus etc besides roles

00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,350
are also a lot of Aria attributes again

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,060
I'm not going to dive deep into any of

00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:17,190
these there are a lot of them go check

00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:20,880
them out but these tell the

00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:22,709
accessibility API things about elements

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,450
on your site that normally you would

00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:27,570
indicate through maybe a change of color

00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:29,640
this is no longer disabled or an icon

00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:32,760
this arrow means you can expand or

00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:34,630
collapse this element or this element

00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:38,350
has a pop-up when you click

00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:40,120
these things are not readily evident if

00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,860
you're just looking at the markup all

00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,540
right it makes sense if you have CSS and

00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,040
you're looking at it visually so you can

00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,900
use these Aria properties to get that

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,780
across another important one is Aria

00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:51,160
hidden use Aria hidden if this is an

00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,590
element maybe it's just a little

00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,270
graphical flourish it's not really part

00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:57,460
of the content it doesn't need to be

00:15:55,270 --> 00:16:01,810
represented in any text form so just

00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:03,130
hide it alright so we've let's say we've

00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,930
done all the work we've setup our

00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,890
headings we've done all our alt tags we

00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,600
think we're ready to go

00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:09,880
time to check our site and make sure it

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,060
actually works now there are a number of

00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:15,130
automatic checkers you can use the w3c

00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:17,980
has a huge list of them many of those

00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:19,510
links are not even broken a checker is

00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,190
one that I've used it works pretty well

00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,570
there are lots of browser extensions and

00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,190
you're gonna go back and forth with

00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:25,600
these checkers many times before you get

00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,310
rid of all the warnings but hopefully

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,080
you end up with 100 percent passing

00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:32,560
it'll get a little bad you can put on

00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:34,150
your website 100 percent wcag 2.0

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,500
triple-a compliance you feel great about

00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:39,430
yourself pat yourself on the back and

00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:41,710
you're done right no you're not done I

00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:43,300
know because I tried that my boss said

00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:45,070
we're gonna make the website accessible

00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,390
I said great I did that much research I

00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,490
did all my alt tags

00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:50,620
passed inspection and then I was sitting

00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:52,960
in a meeting with my boss his boss and

00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,700
an accessibility consultant on the other

00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,590
end of the phone who was using just a

00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:59,530
keyboard and a screen reader to navigate

00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:02,680
our site gave him the URL he dialed it

00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:05,620
up and then there was silence and then

00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:07,030
he said hmm and that is not good and he

00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,370
said is there supposed to be some sort

00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:11,350
of navigation or menu element on your

00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,880
site and my heart just kind of drops

00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:14,860
down to here because I was the main

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,270
developer for this yes there was

00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,520
supposed to be a navigation and he

00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,650
couldn't find it once we got him to find

00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,240
it he wasn't able to open it up once he

00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,720
was the links in there didn't make any

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,450
sense

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,070
so after this complete embarrassment I

00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:29,260
decided it was time to get real I

00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:31,150
decided it was time to unplug the mouse

00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,010
put on my headphones open up a screen

00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,350
reader and you can get one of these for

00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,360
free if you have a Mac voiceover comes

00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:39,400
for free use Chrome there's a chrome

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,010
plugin that comes for free and actually

00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,510
sit down and try to do what this person

00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:48,340
was doing and try to actually navigate

00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:51,549
the site so let's try it

00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:59,260
let me see if I can do this really

00:17:51,549 --> 00:18:01,059
quickly displays arrangement mirror are

00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:05,200
you looking at my screen yes okay cool

00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:07,659
so and this should work let's start so

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:12,490
this is gonna be a little bit unfair um

00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:15,309
I wanted to look at Jango Khan 2018 but

00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:17,200
I didn't have a lot of time for this

00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:19,299
presentation so I decided to skip over

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,220
that because actually congratulation

00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:23,140
since the Jing er Khan web devs it

00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,279
passes inspection pretty well so I'm

00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,960
gonna go to something a little bit more

00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:29,320
embarrassing they still have online

00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,549
Jango Khan 2009 when things were all

00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,460
about gradients and we thought the

00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:35,919
matrix was really cool so let's load up

00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,260
our voiceover application and see what

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,850
it sounds like

00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:42,640
voiceover on Chrome home vertical line

welcome to django con django con is a

00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:23,049
Janko conference that aims to bring

00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,770
together the cover off enough of that so

00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:27,010
let's talk about what we just

00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:29,020
experienced this is really difficult and

00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,830
I encourage all of you go home don't do

00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,899
it right now

00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:33,760
but try this load up a web site maybe

00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:36,159
one that you manage or maybe just any

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,960
old one and try to actually go through

00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:40,600
it just using your keyboard and a

00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:43,450
voiceover application it is difficult it

00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,890
is frustrating but it will bring to

00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,299
light a lot of things that you can fix

00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:50,110
that you probably didn't even realize

00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:52,419
before now that logo it didn't have any

00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:55,870
alt tags so it just said slash logo dot

00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:58,120
PNG not terribly helpful the navigation

00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:01,150
worked pretty well it there it wasn't

00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:03,100
using the nav html5 element

00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:05,350
so we it didn't actually say navigation

00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:07,180
but we knew it was a list of links this

00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,790
register link obviously was not helpful

00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:12,220
unless you picked up event event right

00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:14,890
and you knew it was register link talk

00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:17,410
doesn't tell us anything and then I get

00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,970
to an h2 called welcome to Django com

00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,530
sounds like the beginning of the page

00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:22,600
but it's not an h1 so I feel like I

00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:25,920
might have missed something so overall

00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:28,270
not a great score for Django Khan 2009

00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,220
but you might say that's unfair that's

00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,970
not a modern site we didn't know about

00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,550
these things

00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:36,040
yes we did remember HTML 2.0 came out in

00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:39,210
1995 but let's go to something more

00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:43,330
modern and see what that sounds like

00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:46,390
Amazon if I if someone asked me hey

00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:48,340
could you please read amazon.com to me I

00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,850
would probably panic and throw up a

00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,540
little bit

00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:53,980
I can barely navigate Amazon even as you

00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,140
know my only disability is a slight

00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,520
astigmatism and I can't find anything on

00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,490
here but let's just see what it sounds

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,770
like

00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:04,390
voiceover on Chrome amazon.com online

00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:07,270

mess just call the hotline and honestly

00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:02,559
I'm tempted to use the hotline too

00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:05,920
because I honestly can't figure out how

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:07,420
to cancel Showtime alright let's check

00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,190
out mezzanine if you're not familiar

00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,860
with mezzanine it's another CMS similar

00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:13,870
to Django CMS and wagtail and the great

00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,590
thing about mezzanine is if you set it

00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,750
up with the

00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:19,059
the demo site it uses they put together

00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:21,250
some default templates which are really

00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:23,460
out of the box very accessible and part

00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:25,510
of this is because they are using

00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,700
bootstrap templates and bootstrap

00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:30,789
components if you want a crash course in

00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:33,039
how Aria roles and Aria attributes work

00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:35,529
go check out the bootstrap components

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,970
they have it set up really nice all of

00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:38,679
their menus that are modal's their

00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:40,539
buttons they all use these attributes

00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:42,190
really well so let's see what mezzanine

00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:44,350
sounds like and this is just a basic

00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:46,419
default set way so everyone Chrome blog

00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:50,520

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,840
gonna cancel it there just so that we

00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:29,830
can let our ears rest for a second but

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:32,020
the overall I would say mezzanine does a

00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:34,720
great job if you're looking to try to

00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:37,720
start up a very accessible django
