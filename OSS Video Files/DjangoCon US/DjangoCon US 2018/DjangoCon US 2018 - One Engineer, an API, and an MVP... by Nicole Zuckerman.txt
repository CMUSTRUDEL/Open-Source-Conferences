Description: 
	DjangoCon US 2018 - One Engineer, an API, and an MVP: Or how I spent one hour improving hiring data at my company. by Nicole Zuckerman

The fact that tech is struggling to hire or retain employees from diverse backgrounds has been written about and discussed thoroughly, particularly in the last few years. The economic, societal, and moral benefits of diversity are also well documented. Why is it hard, then, for well-intentioned organizations to shift their demographics? There are a number of reasons, but one that doesn’t appear to have been thoroughly discussed already is the challenge of gathering and responding to data about diversity within a company’s hiring pool and existing employees. One hack day, I was involved in too many projects and had only a token amount of time to devote to the one I was most interested in; seeing if we could determine whether we had sufficient diversity for any given role to start interviewing candidates, or if we needed to spend more efforts sourcing diverse candidates for the pool. I accomplished an MVP in approximately an hour, once I had an api key and permissions. It doesn’t necessarily require a huge effort to make a big difference.

In this talk, I’ll walk through the MVP indicating, for each role, whether there was “sufficient diversity”. I’ll also address gotchas, limitations, and What Now.

00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:21,650
hi I'm Nicole Zukerman that's me on the

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,990
left

00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,820
best wedding picture ever right I'm a

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,890
senior software engineer at Clover

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,990
health yes we are absolutely hiring

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,880
let's talk later I've been interested in

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,809
issues of representation and diversity

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,550
for around 16 years now and I love that

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:40,079
my technical skills allow me to affect

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,309
how we go about doing things at Clover

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,520
health and improve diversity inclusion

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,950
it's like infinite cosmic power

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,640
so I'm glad to be here talking about it

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,980
with y'all today and if you want you can

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,980
like message me on Twitter that's my

00:00:52,980 --> 00:01:00,320
twitter handle that's right

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:04,010
I never post though so I do check it

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,180
anyway we know diversity is valuable

00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:08,850
what stops us from collecting data to

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,260
help us improve the fact that Tech has

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,430
struggled to hire and retain employees

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,920
from diverse backgrounds has been

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,060
written about and discussed extensively

00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,860
particularly in the last few years and

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,479
the benefits are also really well

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,100
documented so why is it hard for

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,140
well-intentioned organizations to shift

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,640
the demographics there are a number of

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,619
reasons but one I don't think has been

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,119
discussed as thoroughly is a challenge

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,310
of actually gathering and responding to

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,170
data about diversity within a company's

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,240
hiring pool and existing employees if

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,799
you want to talk about getting that

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,079
information from employees let's talk

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,240
later for today I'm just gonna focus on

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:44,759
getting that data in your diversity in

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,990
your candidate pipeline I know words I'm

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,899
a masters in English literature of

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,970
course I know how I speak so one half

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,530
day I was involved in too many projects

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,390
and had only like a token amount of time

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,979
to devote to the one that I was most

00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,000
interested in which is seeing if we

00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,009
could determine whether we had

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,860
sufficient diversity for any given role

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,420
to start interviewing candidates or if

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,850
we needed to spend more time sourcing

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,530
diverse candidates for the pool I

00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:10,110
accomplished an MVP in approximately an

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,849
hour once I had the API key and

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,170
permissions honestly getting the right

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:15,970
permissions from HR was like

00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:19,569
the hardest part sorry from recruiting

00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:20,890
that took the longest amount of time so

00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:23,200
if there's anything you take away from

00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:25,780
today aside from a picture of my dog

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,540
which I'll show you at the end I want it

00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:31,110
to be that it doesn't actually take a

00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:34,209
huge effort to make a big difference and

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,610
everyone should give it a go all right

00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:38,320
so here's what you're in for

00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,330
I'm gonna walk through the MVP that I

00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:44,050
did during hack day I'll talk a bit

00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:46,000
about the v2 I'll talk about some

00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,280
gotchas or limitations that I uncovered

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,580
and then we'll talk about what happens

00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:56,350
now you win all right let's do all right

00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,420
so this is the web app I put together

00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,670
for hack day it was around a year ago

00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:03,880
this is the MVP the front end literally

00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:07,269
has no Styles is as bare bones and bare

00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,010
bones as can be but it works I am NOT a

00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:09,880
front-end developer by any stretch and

00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:13,330
you'll be able to see that in a couple

00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:15,070
slides all right so there's it's a

00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:17,980
simple jeg vil web app with one view

00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:20,440
there's a bunch of real-time API calls

00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:24,130
to green house to fetch data green house

00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:26,500
just happens to be the recruiting funnel

00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:29,620
tool that we use there are other ones

00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,730
out there that also have api's but this

00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,980
just happens to be the one we were using

00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:34,959
and this is pretty hacky code in

00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:38,170
production this would never fly which

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,299
like uh nested for loop and like the

00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,310
performance of the code is terrible but

00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:44,500
as a proof of concept it was really

00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:47,170
effective to give people a chance to see

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,790
exactly how homogeneous or a diverse our

00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:52,560
candidate pool really was for any given

00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:56,049
goal so this is the one django view at

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,780
the high level it gets a list of jobs it

00:03:56,049 --> 00:04:01,600
gets all the applications for each job

00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:05,079
and then for each application it gets

00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:07,420
the EEOC data associated with each

00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,890
application whether you say that you're

00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,870
a man or a woman what your race is

00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,660
whether you're a veteran whether you

00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,489
have a disability it does a little

00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:18,220
number smashing at the end renders a

00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:20,049
list with of jobs with data about how

00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:24,060
diverse the candidate pool is for each

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:24,060
so this is the thing at a high level

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:30,040
here are the API calls I make they're

00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:33,760
not fancy I hard-coded the URLs because

00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:35,490
hack day I hit greenhouses API and Lopez

00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,080
data for each of these three endpoints

00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,630
there's one where I get the list of jobs

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,280
that are open right now and were created

00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,850
after a certain point created after

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,610
because when I load this in a web

00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:52,510
browser it literally takes 10 minutes

00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:55,630
hack day and then I for each of those

00:04:52,510 --> 00:05:00,729
jobs I get the applications and then

00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:06,250
there should be one or zero EEOC chunks

00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:09,310
for each application and so here's where

00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:12,910
I add an applicant status to the blob

00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:15,669
for this job I anonymize and tally

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:18,039
number of applicants self attesting as

00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:20,530
belonging to a protected group and then

00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:25,139
just display aggregates for each role on

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:28,810
one page so this will say there are

00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:36,520
blank women in the pool for this role or

00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:38,770
there are blank veterans front-end

00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,570
developer I am NOT so this is what the

00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,460
thing looks like for any role it says

00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:44,740
whether there is sufficient diversity

00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,389
we'll talk about that later to move

00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:54,010
forward with interviewing candidates for

00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:56,590
the role all right so now that we've

00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:58,930
gone through the hack day version what

00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:00,580
happens then there were a lot of things

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,789
that probably needed to change to make

00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:05,050
this ready for production the one that

00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:08,590
was killing me was those nested

00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:11,289
for-loops with like real-time API calls

00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:13,930
it took 10 minutes so this is like me

00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:17,470
hitting the end point of the the view

00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:20,800
once and then there's just the output

00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:23,680
goes on for days and that's just like

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,150
hitting it one time and you also don't

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,830
want to have people waiting 10 minutes

00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:32,260
to see their results so because of the

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,240
way that greenhouses API works I

00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,729
couldn't do it together

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,500
anymore than I already did but this is a

00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:42,140
ton of API calls it'd be much better

00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,370
to collect the data regularly stored in

00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,980
a database where we can make fewer

00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,750
queries by using table relationships so

00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,790
our first order of business was to sync

00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,610
the new data from green house to our

00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:55,040
database and have no synchronous API

00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:57,770
calls to a third party and then our page

00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:00,260
can load in the snap now the next hurdle

00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,760
is how do we know what data is new how

00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,340
do we up sir instead of getting

00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:09,860
everything fresh each load but that's a

00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:11,720
problem for future Nicole another those

00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,880
are not mine I wish another thing we

00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,040
decided to do for v2 was to only show

00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,169
diversity stats for candidates who have

00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:22,340
exited the pipeline already people who

00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:26,000
have either accepted an offer or left

00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,800
the pipeline because they withdrew or or

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,900
we decided not to move forward with

00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,330
their candidacy otherwise there's

00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:34,130
potential for a hiring manager to look

00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:37,130
at this page see the candidates we're

00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:40,040
evaluating and go oh we need more

00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,510
veterans to increase our EEOC data for

00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,750
this year we should totally hire this

00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:47,120
woman because it's illegal you can't

00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:50,390
make hiring decisions based on someone's

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:54,350
protected class like whether you know

00:07:50,390 --> 00:08:00,229
being female or veteran status

00:07:54,350 --> 00:08:02,600
disability status and race we also added

00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:04,550
a list view of all roles where you can

00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:08,960
click through for details for a

00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:10,370
particular role or Department the other

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,250
things that we wanted to accomplish with

00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:15,380
v2 were showing diversity at every step

00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,780
of the pipeline from recruiter screen

00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:19,940
through offer acceptance and being able

00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,710
to slice data to see the story for a

00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:24,140
particular group or from a particular

00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,880
source or from a particular recruiter so

00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:29,030
you can say like oh we get really great

00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:32,780
candidates from this source but this

00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:35,839
source not so much or we're really we're

00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:38,360
super represented with people of color

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,650
but we're not really great at reaching

00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,650
out to people with disabilities

00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:48,160
all right so here were the things that

00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:50,540
totally tripped me up fortunately I

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,550
figured stuff out or head how people

00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,329
helped me figure stuff out before any

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:57,049
sensitive data any

00:08:53,329 --> 00:09:00,379
where any sensitive data went anywhere

00:08:57,049 --> 00:09:01,610
so one be careful with people's

00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:04,189
sensitive information

00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,839
I suggest you host the data where not

00:09:04,189 --> 00:09:09,769
everyone can access it like this poor

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,970
puppy but you know that's it's it's

00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:14,299
probably made of chocolate and he

00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:16,189
shouldn't have it so one thing that we

00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:17,509
did was we anonymized our data when

00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:20,059
pulling information about candidates

00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:21,259
using an API for example we didn't store

00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:26,989
any information that's personally

00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:29,119
identifiable no names no nothing I also

00:09:26,989 --> 00:09:30,649
recommend that your database not be in a

00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:31,910
place where all of engineering can

00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:34,339
access it because these are like

00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:36,920
potentially their co-workers or

00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:39,529
themselves and it's not really cool to

00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:43,339
surface people's personal data for other

00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:44,959
people to access so I would also say put

00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:46,610
your API keys in a private place that

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,290
not even all of engineering can access

00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:50,929
otherwise if you have your database

00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:53,179
stored in a place that is private but

00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:54,379
everyone can access the API key they can

00:09:53,179 --> 00:10:00,529
get the data for themselves and then

00:09:54,379 --> 00:10:01,730
where are you and I would also argue for

00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:04,069
different levels of permission be

00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,389
sensitive about who can see what maybe

00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:06,949
everyone should get the ten thousand

00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:10,459
foot view and in all hands that's the

00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:12,559
cookie version but being able to see per

00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:14,959
role slicing on different tags should

00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,220
maybe be limited access and maybe only

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,589
like your diversity and inclusion

00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:21,919
manager if you have one gets to see like

00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:26,119
all the granular stuff that's the

00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:29,169
ingredients metaphor it's really only a

00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:29,169
meta three let's be real

00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:35,749
so another decision that we ended up

00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:37,669
making was to show results only four

00:10:35,749 --> 00:10:39,259
groups of minimum pool size or greater

00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:40,910
even though that means that we get data

00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:42,230
on a slower cadence than real time in

00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,869
order to give the pool size a chance to

00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:47,269
get large enough for real anonymity be

00:10:44,869 --> 00:10:48,589
aware of combinations veteran disability

00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:50,839
gender and race combinations are

00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:54,169
identify identifiable even with

00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:56,720
anonymity so for example if I'm like hey

00:10:54,169 --> 00:11:00,499
who were the musician Muppets there's

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:03,079
like five of them and if I say who are

00:11:00,499 --> 00:11:06,350
the blue Muppets yeah there's like five

00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,860
of them but if I say which are the blue

00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:12,230
music

00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:14,450
shin's there's only one he's very easily

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:22,310
identifiable and you don't want to have

00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:26,330
that so let me just stress for you one

00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:30,320
more time the importance of anonymizing

00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:34,250
data and not after you keep your minimum

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,480
pool size and also consider not

00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:41,840
including candidates who are currently

00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:44,710
in the pipeline make sure that no one

00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:47,720
can make decisions based on any of the

00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:51,290
about a candidacy based on the

00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:55,460
information that is in your web app like

00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:56,750
I said before that's super illegal right

00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:00,410
so I was telling you not to do anything

00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:03,380
illegal right yeah that's totally it

00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:05,480
and making any decisions about a

00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,340
candidate whether you move forward or

00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,350
not based on their protected class is

00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:11,720
totally illegal do not do that and so

00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:14,270
the best way that I found to not do that

00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,100
was to not give was to not keep people

00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,780
the opportunity to do that and show

00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,050
information for people who are currently

00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:24,380
viable candidates cool but be in a

00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:28,490
pipeline okay so another challenge that

00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:31,460
we have is that not as a data sparsity

00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:33,080
not everyone fills out information it's

00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,910
not available necessarily for referrals

00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,740
or candidates who are sourced internally

00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:38,450
and even on the website not everyone

00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,960
chooses to fill out this information

00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:43,790
even though in my head I was like yeah

00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,110
I'm gonna get this data and it's gonna

00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:47,150
be glorious we're gonna have so much

00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:48,980
information to make decisions on and

00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:52,180
then you get to reality and like one

00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:54,050
person has filled it out so under

00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,700
understanding why the data is sparse

00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:57,770
will help you figure out how to mitigate

00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,930
it and understanding by the data sparse

00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,790
has a lot to do with humans solutions

00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:05,030
are regarding humans are usually

00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:06,650
specific to a group of like what they

00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,510
have in common so like what works for

00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:10,220
employees is not the same as what works

00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:13,310
to get more data from candidates for

00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,140
example so sometimes there's like no

00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:17,990
opportunity collect to collect data from

00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:20,620
non system inputs for example the source

00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:24,280
candidates so what you can do about it

00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:28,300
instrument human systems like have your

00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:30,550
recruiting folks make sure that they

00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:34,210
tell that they ask for this information

00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,290
with all candidates also folks are often

00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,850
suspicious about what you're going to do

00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:38,140
with their information and are worried

00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,330
that it's gonna be used against them in

00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:42,010
some way and since you don't have a

00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:43,330
rapport built with them very much by the

00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:45,220
time they're applying on the website

00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:47,440
there's not necessarily a ton you can do

00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,840
about that except maybe like put a line

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,400
saying we respect your privacy and your

00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:55,390
data this information is going to be

00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:57,550
used for like these purposes etc just to

00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:02,520
like give them a little confidence that

00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:02,520
you are not a jerk right and you're not

00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,550
so then another problem is that the data

00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,320
that we need to collect by law doesn't

00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,820
necessarily match up with what we want

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,810
to collect or what people might be

00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,360
willing to divulge

00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,980
we're also we're just limited by what

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,350
it's legal to ass you can't ask anything

00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:19,510
about someone's age and you also

00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:22,150
shouldn't ask anything that's gonna like

00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:27,850
lead to you figuring out someone's age

00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:29,320
because intent matters and you also need

00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,600
to decide what labels and groups to

00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,530
include like for gender questions what

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,770
are your options

00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:37,360
the federal government collects only

00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:39,280
male or female or less think men and

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,990
women or something like that but like I

00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,950
know that there's non-binary people out

00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:46,930
there how can i reconcile the legal

00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:51,240
requirements from my understanding of

00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:51,240
the world and wanting to be inclusive

00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:55,750
making a survey is an art unto itself

00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,160
and it's possible to ask questions and

00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:00,070
elicit a response that you did not

00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:04,060
intend so if you have like researchers

00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:06,730
who work at your company maybe ask them

00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:09,430
for their help federal contractors have

00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:12,070
an EEOC requirement that's Equal

00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:13,630
Employment Opportunity Commission that

00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:16,660
requires these certain questions and

00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:18,100
potential answers that don't certainly

00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,080
don't line up with what I would like to

00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,610
ask and so that couldn't lead you to

00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:25,740
have like multiple surveys which cause a

00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:25,740
survey fatigue and again suspicion

00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,170
alright so now let's get to this

00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,130
elephant in the room

00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:34,240
what is sufficient diversity anyway

00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:38,500
there was this article in the

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:42,339
Business Review about the relationship

00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:45,339
between what the makeup of your finalist

00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:47,830
pool for a role and the hiring decision

00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:49,240
so if you have zero diverse candidates

00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,320
in a pool you're obviously not gonna

00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,750
hire anyone from an underrepresented

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,950
group but according to the handful of

00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,860
studies that were in this Harvard

00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:58,589
Business Review article even with one

00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,880
candidate from a minority group that

00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:02,529
person has like zero chance of getting

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:07,870
hired because of our preference for the

00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:09,520
status quo as the article says deviating

00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,890
from the norm can be risky for decision

00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,480
makers as people tend to ostracize those

00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:14,770
who are different from the group for

00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,959
women and minorities having your

00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:19,660
differences made salient can also lead

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:22,600
to inferences of incompetence basically

00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:24,610
being the only woman in a pool of

00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,990
finalists highlights how different you

00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:31,810
are from the norm and then makes you

00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:33,880
riskier so this also works for racial

00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:35,500
minorities the odds of hiring a minority

00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,020
we're a hundred ninety three times

00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,399
greater if there were at least two

00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:41,050
minority candidates in the finalist pool

00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:43,209
controlling for like the number of other

00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:44,770
minorities and white finalists and the

00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:47,910
effect held no matter what the pool size

00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:50,770
was like six finalists eight finalists

00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:52,570
so like even having two people from an

00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:56,620
underrepresented group makes a big

00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:59,950
difference but that's a pretty low bar

00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:02,350
right what we saw was from like a

00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:03,760
limited size of finalists so if you've

00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,530
got an applicant pool for a role like

00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,179
software engineer you're gonna have way

00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,410
more candidates to choose from so even

00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:10,510
if you have two people from a minority

00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:13,059
group represented if there are thousand

00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:14,949
people from the in-group even putting

00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:16,750
aside unconscious bias which totally

00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:18,280
exists and will whittle the diversity of

00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:21,130
your pool at every stage of the pipeline

00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,929
and our status quo fix of having two

00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:24,490
candidates you're statistically still

00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:26,500
very unlikely to hire someone who's from

00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:29,860
the status quo who's not from the status

00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,360
quo alright so what do we do now why not

00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,550
try going for parity with the eligible

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,840
label labor force in the US then at

00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,550
least at the top of your funnel is

00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,170
balanced you stand a greater chance of

00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:40,480
having those people make it through your

00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,770
hiring process not that it's smooth

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,600
sailing from there we still need to

00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,919
institute systems to limit the effective

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,500
unconscious bias and the rest of the

00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:49,720
hiring pipeline but it's a start

00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:53,260
so this is a table of gender and race in

00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:55,419
the potential labor force from 2017 the

00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:58,539
base number is a thousand so the total

00:17:55,419 --> 00:18:01,419
number of black women who and who were

00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:03,400
in the workforce was 10.5 million out of

00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:06,480
seventeen point five million black women

00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:09,940
who could have been in the labor force

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,710
approximately I round not all those

00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,480
people are qualified for every job or

00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,590
even interested but if we support

00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,480
programs that give training and

00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:18,520
opportunities underrepresented groups

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,960
while we also try to get as close as

00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,360
possible to having our pipelines

00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,890
represent that population pool we might

00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,000
actually get there but if we don't set

00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:31,270
our sights that high we're never going

00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:33,130
to alright so what now well it turns out

00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:36,220
we found out when we were midway through

00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:41,110
our v2 that there's a company that does

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:43,059
a lot of the hiring pool stuff out of

00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:45,250
the box so we ultimately decided to use

00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:46,150
them for the future so engineering hours

00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,820
don't need to support the web app

00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:50,260
indefinitely could we have done our

00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,110
research to discover this company first

00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,159
and save ourselves the work absolutely

00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:58,270
would anyone have thought to google it

00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:59,380
before I made my MVP unlikely we found

00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,760
out about the company through our

00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:03,190
diversity inclusion manager who joined

00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:06,570
right after I made my MVP of course if

00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:08,409
you have D&I people talk to them early

00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:10,450
if you don't have the budget to

00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:12,990
outsource the way we ultimately did the

00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:15,130
web app we discussed is perfectly usable

00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:17,260
it probably requires some further

00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:19,990
iteration to handle the sparsity of data

00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:22,809
and you need to figure out what is

00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:24,490
sufficiently diverse for you but even if

00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:27,159
your time is limited the MVP is better

00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:29,530
than nothing at all if you go this route

00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:32,260
make sure to include any D&I people at

00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:33,610
your company and recruiting and legal

00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,289
but if you're willing to do the work

00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:37,000
most of time people are happy to give

00:19:35,289 --> 00:19:39,280
you their opinion and send you off on

00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:45,280
your way but don't try to do this

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:47,950
without knowing what's legal someday

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,720
it'd be really great to integrate data

00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:52,030
from candidates with data from current

00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,440
employees but that's pretty challenging

00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:58,870
because those are almost never in the

00:19:53,440 --> 00:20:00,309
same systems so maybe next hack day now

00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,970
when you identify different departments

00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:02,440
or

00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:04,120
rolls where there isn't representation

00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,530
across different groups you can go back

00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,390
and source those missing groups if

00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:09,100
there's a big drop-off at one step of

00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:10,539
the recruiting funnel investigate why

00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,190
people are leaving there so this is fake

00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:14,710
data but this is the format of a report

00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:17,010
I look at quarterly for one role

00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:19,120
software engineer you see the counts and

00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:21,700
pass-through rate for men versus women

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,780
for each stage of a hiring pipeline at

00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,039
the beginning you start with a hundred

00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,539
men and fifty women in the pipeline

00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:29,110
which is not representative of the

00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:31,240
population but not awful but in the

00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:32,679
application or resume review stage fifty

00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,690
percent of the men make it through but

00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:36,070
only twenty percent of the women looks

00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:38,230
like you need to see what's going on in

00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:39,820
that resume review stage at the phone

00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:42,010
crane stage you still have more men than

00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,690
women 50 and 10 respectively but they

00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:46,120
make it through the same rate 30 percent

00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:47,530
that seems okay then for the on-site you

00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,419
have 80 percent of men making it through

00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:51,970
the stage but only 33 percent of women

00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:54,400
oh maybe take a look at your on site and

00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:55,809
see what's happening there and because I

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,030
work in a really pretty place everyone

00:20:55,809 --> 00:20:59,440
accepts their offer but Wow we lost a

00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:04,419
chance to hire women at the resume

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:07,690
review and on-site stages so this is

00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:09,370
hard do it anyway since the problem is

00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,840
one of people in systems it's inherently

00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:12,400
challenging especially if you're a

00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,340
person who's at the apex of privilege in

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,840
our society do what you can from my

00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,600
little perfectionist heart to yours

00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,799
admit you won't have it perfect try to

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,679
build processes around data collection

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,960
wherever you can don't yes about

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:29,500
someone's gender or race unless you're

00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:31,179
required to by law or if you're going to

00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,070
which I don't prefer that you do

00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:34,150
outsource it to a company that does it

00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,250
professionally like with machine

00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:40,390
learning they're honestly like probably

00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:41,770
slightly less biased than humans and if

00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:44,289
you are at the apex of privileged

00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:45,700
sassette white men you should involve

00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:47,530
people from underrepresented groups to

00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,940
be involved in the process listen to

00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:50,950
them they know how things come across

00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,990
but don't make them do the lion's share

00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,520
of the work my recommendation is to so

00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:56,590
let's solicit their opinion early and

00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,590
often do some work show them what you

00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:01,090
did and ask for feedback but also deal

00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:02,350
with it with grace if they don't want to

00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,700
be involved because they've been

00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,840
carrying this burden the whole time up

00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:09,220
till now and you're like coming in the

00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:10,870
last mile like come on so those are just

00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,980
some examples I happen to have there's

00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,990
ton of other things you can do to

00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,919
instrument your hiring pipeline or

00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:17,470
measure changes and include

00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:18,730
at your company Cheryl what worked what

00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,529
didn't work for you so we as a community

00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:22,509
can learn from each other and develop

00:22:20,529 --> 00:22:23,980
best practices there's no reason to keep

00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:25,629
best practices about diversity inclusion

00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:29,230
secret I want the special sauce all over

00:22:25,629 --> 00:22:34,149
tech so that's me and my Twitter handle

00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:35,830
that's my dog Chloe if you follow her on

00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:37,330
instagram at Corgi in the front I

00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,710
promise you will not be disappointed her

00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:42,159
front legs are a little shorter than her

00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:43,690
back legs and I worked at Clover health

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,299
it's really great come work with me

00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,890
Chloe says you should work with me

00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:56,489
Thanks

00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:56,489
