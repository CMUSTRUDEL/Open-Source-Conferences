Description: 
	DjangoCon US 2018 - How to give a damn, and stand out by Amber Wanner

This talk will give you some tips and techniques as well as some real (raw) examples of how I was able to start a company at 23 years old, lock in an investment, and beat out my competitors who were a lot older and more experienced than I. The talk will demonstrate different scenarios and solutions in which it takes to stand out, and be remembered in a saturated market, in whatever field you may be in. Whether you are a developer interviewing for your dream job, starting a business, or somewhere in between and just trying to make your way in the world. Implementing emotional awareness and intelligence in your life will change not just the way you interview but the way you are perceived by others in your work life, as well as your social life.

My friends call it the “Amber effect” but I call it, giving a damn.

In this talk we will cover:

How to leave a lasting impression, every time.
The importance of long term benefits vs instant gratification when it comes to building relationships
How to stand out as a potential job applicant
How to get the attention of a prospective client, including c-level executives.
How to identify opportunity and advantages out of unexpected circumstances (When things don’t go your way)
How to add value beyond scope of work
Genuinely giving a damn without expectation

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:28,590
more about what we do a candidate and a

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:30,960
little bit my twitter is right here and

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:35,250
my email is there as well if you guys

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,840
want to send me an email afterwards so

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,570
you guys are probably wondering why

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,180
there's a picture of The Sound of Music

00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:44,430
so when I was 10 years old I was in a

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,690
singing competition and the song was

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,390
these are a few of my favorite things

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,070
all of my family and friends were there

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,489
in the audience and I got up on stage

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,730
looked around the audience and choked a

00:00:53,489 --> 00:01:00,390
little bit and ran offstage crying

00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:03,329
so hopefully that won't happen today but

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,680
no seriously public speaking is or

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,909
anything involving standing on stage

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,520
trying to picture the audience in their

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,930
underwear is very intimidated so I

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,590
applaud all the speakers who did an

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,960
awesome job this week all right so a

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,090
little bit about me I am a co-organizer

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,549
of several tech meetups in Philadelphia

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,400
including kubernetes ansible Ruby

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:32,549
Prometheus Raspberry Pi docker project

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:35,189
cog Nova and a couple more so like what

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:36,869
did I put up there so project cog Noah

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:38,220
is actually one of my personal favorites

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:41,250
and you guys could check out the github

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,960
it's tagged Noma basically what we did

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,540
was we partnered with Penn's cancer data

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,600
lab and we worked on an ongoing

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,119
hackathon that basically took 15 months

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,430
where the tech community came together

00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:55,380
every other Tuesday from 6 to 8 and

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,930
worked on an open source project for

00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,490
genomic data for cancer research it was

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,869
an amazing initiative where software

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,540
developers and data scientists

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:05,040
collectively came together and it's now

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,869
being used by Penn's cancer data lab

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,819
internally as well as Alex's Lemonade

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:12,540
Stand who found out about the project

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:13,710
from one of our meetups so yes if you

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,670
want to check out the github it's

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,430
actually really really cool to

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:20,340
open-source so you guys could work on

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,780
something with it but what you guys

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,030
really want need to know about me is

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:32,010
that I am a three-time all-star corncob

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:34,170
eating champion and so if anyone thinks

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:40,350
that they could beat me I am down after

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:42,000
this talk but I also started a company

00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:46,980
that basically sets folks and the tech

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,600
community up with jobs and/or dates so

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,480
basically and I'll tell you a little bit

00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,130
about exactly what that means and also

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,870
so when my talk was accepted I started

00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,480
preparing for it and I had a moment of

00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,490
realization of snap I'm presenting at a

00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:04,160
conference for developers and developers

00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:06,000
hate recruiters which I don't blame you

00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,130
but I'll give you a little bit of

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,470
background on me and how I started the

00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,850
company and what the company is so I

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,800
started the company when I was 23 years

00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:15,300
old I was working at a recruiting firm

00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,220
and I hated the way recruiting companies

00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,270
treated their candidates it seemed to me

00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,160
that they were just looking to put a

00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,870
button to see and that was not the way I

00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,400
did things I would place developers and

00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,630
jobs and I got to know them really well

00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,460
I knew everything about them so and they

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:31,560
became my friends so I noticed a pattern

00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,090
that kept coming up my developers would

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,100
often say you found me this awesome job

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:39,270
now I'm in a great place in my life now

00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,560
I only could find me a partner so then I

00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,390
would go home and I would be hanging out

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,250
with my girlfriends and listen to them

00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:47,010
complaining about online dating and how

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:54,360
they can't be a decent person who has a

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:56,700
job and I was like I just met this

00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,150
awesome person who has a job and I could

00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,150
vouch for that

00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:07,460
so it got me thinking why not so I did

00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,260
what any other crazy 23 year old would

00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:11,210
do and I quit my job and started

00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,580
candidate with literally no clue in the

00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,930
world what I was doing the next eight

00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,510
months I spent working out of a

00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:19,130
Starbucks and having clients come there

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:22,070
and I didn't even have a name for my

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:24,430
company and one day I was on my way to

00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:28,010
meet someone and Rihanna the song

00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:31,430
possible candidate came on and I was

00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:33,620
like that's it candidate and so that's

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,840
how it came to be eight months later

00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:41,390
Rihanna investment and we are now four

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,980
years in so I founded the company on

00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,690
Maslow's hierarchy of needs while

00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,010
studying sociology in school I learned

00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,140
about various different levels of the

00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:50,750
pyramid and how one would ultimately

00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,860
reach self self-actualization I saw that

00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,320
when someone's professional life was

00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,840
fulfilled then it greatly impacted their

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,130
personal life and vice-versa so the

00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,790
question is what does this have to do

00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,160
with anything

00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:03,020
well that brings me to the topic to the

00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,669
topic of my talk two big areas that I

00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,530
would really like to focus on which is

00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:11,000
flat-out giving a damn I love that I

00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:12,470
could say damn in a presentation and

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,360
standing out whether you're trying to

00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:16,340
get a new job starting a company or

00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,630
trying to get an investment or just

00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,200
simply make it looking to make your way

00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,600
in the world

00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,390
this the tear that we're really going to

00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,919
focus on is the social aspect social

00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:30,200
aspect which includes the need for

00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:31,790
belonging love and inclusion so here at

00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,960
Django con if you can raise your hand

00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:36,220
how many of you would consider yourself

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,900
to be an introvert

00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,190
okay so studies show that between 35 and

00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,400
40 percent of the population are

00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:45,830
introverts but if you find yourself

00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,169
somewhere in between like I do you may

00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:52,160
be considered an ambivert it's not just

00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:53,450
because my name is Amber you struggled

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,130
between wanting to go out and be social

00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,900
it's wanting to go home and be a hermit

00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:59,450
and play video games all night which I

00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,430
like to do so if you find yourself

00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:04,150
between introvert and amber this talk

00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,150
may be good for you

00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:11,120
so giving a damn 101 basically giving a

00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,040
damn with everything that you do without

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,450
ulterior motives so the first person

00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,820
stalk is going to be about giving a damn

00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,110
it's very simple do not give a damn just

00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,340
to expect something in return

00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,230
nine times out of ten you will be

00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,030
disappointed when you do things for

00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,950
other people with that expectation they

00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,330
will notice if you're going for a

00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,850
promotion at work or you're just trying

00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:31,280
to get on the radar of a particular

00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:32,630
company you're interested in volunteer a

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,890
scow you could help or come up with an

00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:36,050
algorithm to help solve a complex

00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:37,190
challenge the company is having if

00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,600
you're noticing something that someone's

00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,340
struggling at work step out of your

00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,530
comfort zone and help them or give them

00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,760
some sort of advice because we all have

00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,800
been there at some point or another

00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,480
when you do something willingly not

00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,730
because you have to but because you want

00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,560
to it allows you to stand out in other

00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:53,450
people's eyes and you are then looked at

00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,930
as someone who adds value beyond scope

00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:59,690
of work so giving a damn towards other

00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,860
human beings this one's my favorite I

00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,050
have very strong feelings towards the

00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:05,600
Sun most people just want to be heard

00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,610
listen to understood whether you're an

00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,110
introvert extrovert ambivert people tend

00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,940
to dismiss others before getting to know

00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:15,410
them I always keep in mind that we are

00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:17,090
all human and going through stuff when

00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:19,280
giving a damn you just do you don't look

00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:23,510
for something in return which brings me

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:27,530
to the amber effect so what in the world

00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:29,240
is the amber effect good question I had

00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,919
no idea either but my friends would

00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,710
always say it anytime something bizarre

00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:35,450
would happen oh it's the amber effect

00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,700
and then I started looking into it more

00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:40,250
and studying it and it all came down to

00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,870
one thing as simple as it may be being

00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,370
human embracing the fact that you are

00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:46,220
human and giving a damn about other

00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,680
humans let me give you a couple examples

00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:50,360
I was at a crypto conference in

00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,780
Philadelphia and sat next to this older

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,340
gentleman

00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,410
we started talking a little bit about

00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:57,020
blockchain and Bitcoin and Philadelphia

00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:59,300
cheesesteaks zero was spoken about

00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,680
business we talked about life the

00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,720
weather and nothing pertaining to why I

00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,370
was there or why he was there the

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,740
speaker went on stage and began to speak

00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:08,870
about a very vulnerable topic addiction

00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,360
and how crypto can play a role in

00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,640
getting help I looked over at my new

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,330
friend and saw sadness as his eyes being

00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,009
swallow

00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:19,069
I decided to share a personal story with

00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:21,689
him because I could tell he was hurting

00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:22,919
48 hours prior to the conference I found

00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:25,319
out that my sister who struggles with

00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:29,550
severe depression was getting into hard

00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:31,319
drugs and I was complement calm sorry I

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,659
was trying to figure out how I was going

00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:36,839
to break this to our mom after being

00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:38,399
vulnerable myself and opening up to him

00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,550
he shared that his sister passed away

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,930
years prior to a heroin overdose we

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,810
shared stories and had raw human

00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:47,190
conversation real conversation it wasn't

00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,870
until later on that I found out that

00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:55,170
this man had sold several companies and

00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:59,970
happened to own 10 NASCAR cars so the

00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:07,230
next week my logo was on the back of a

00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:08,940
NASCAR car my point is when you get to

00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,230
know a stranger and give a damn without

00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:15,120
expectation you never know what could

00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:17,550
come of it so now let's talk about the

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,740
Internet the Internet is a weird place

00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,300
it can be used for good things like

00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,980
socializing with friends ordering

00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,050
services and goods meeting a potential

00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,399
partner learning different cultures and

00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,920
what's going on in the world getting

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:34,110
jobs marketing your business but at

00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:38,610
times it can also be abused so last year

00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:40,170
I got this message that read I am sorry

00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,970
you looked to be about 22 years old way

00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,890
too young for this industry cute but not

00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,660
worth spending time I wish you the best

00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:52,050
of luck modeling would be better for you

00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:55,380
as it is yeah so first off I'm 5-1 I

00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:57,199
couldn't be a model if I trash so

00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,490
clearly has an idea I was talking about

00:09:57,199 --> 00:10:01,079
at first I was discouraged and a little

00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,940
bit embarrassed but then I decided to

00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:04,260
post the message on LinkedIn blare out

00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,060
his name and the company he worked for

00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,500
it so I could simply just show people

00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,709
that doesn't matter what people say

00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:15,630
about you well within 24 hours this post

00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:17,610
had hit 150 that 150,000 page views and

00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,930
I had thousands of requests and messages

00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,570
from people all over the world sharing

00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:23,070
their own stories Huffington Post and

00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,569
Entrepreneur Magazine and a couple other

00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,680
outlets reached out and did an article

00:10:24,569 --> 00:10:27,720
on this unexpected event

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,300
that took place and in return my

00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,040
business actually thrived so I guess it

00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,990
kind of worked out in the end my point

00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,970
is while the Internet can be abused at

00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:39,440
times you can also use it to help you

00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:44,250
and we're going to talk about that next

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,480
okay so standing out 101 let's talk

00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,399
about standing I'm going to dive into

00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,260
three common areas as a job applicant

00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:52,080
when you're interviewing or applying to

00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,940
jobs starting a company or trying to get

00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:57,410
clients and if you're trying to get an

00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,410
investment for an it from an investor

00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:03,990
now what I'm going to tell you you're

00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:05,670
gonna think it's kind of odd this is

00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,320
actually the opposite probably of what

00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,070
you were taught and you're absolutely

00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,149
right

00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,680
we were taught that you send your resume

00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:12,690
and/or a cover letter and wait for a

00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:16,800
response but guess what ain't nobody got

00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:18,180
time for that so the first point I want

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,360
to make is throw your resume and cover

00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,399
letter resumes may tell you what you've

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,350
done in the past but not necessarily

00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,930
what you can do for a company a hiring

00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,430
manager and/or HR manager can check out

00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:32,130
your github in real time and see

00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:35,160
firsthand what you've been doing which

00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:37,830
brings me to explain do not I repeat do

00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:41,520
not apply online unless of course you

00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:43,350
enjoy torturing yourself chances are it

00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,510
may get in front it may never get in

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:49,170
front of the right person hold your

00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:50,430
standards high third find out who the

00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,770
hiring managers and reach out directly

00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:56,880
you can do this on LinkedIn Google

00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:58,410
that's what Google is for look at the

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,839
description and look for words like

00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:05,160
reports into then go and LinkedIn and

00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:06,690
find that person now for tie all those

00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,570
together and do not mention anything

00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,920
about the job when reaching out I want

00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,420
you to keep it short and sweet when you

00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:16,339
do send a message and do not mention

00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:18,990
anything about what you're looking for

00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:20,880
examples and these are examples that

00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:24,810
I've used with developers who are

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,610
looking for jobs and friends of mine so

00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,350
the first one is hey I think it could

00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,370
make sense for us to me do you go to XYZ

00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:31,020
meetup often

00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,180
human beings are naturally curious

00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,170
creatures this person who's going to

00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,839
want to know why you think it makes

00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,080
sense for you guys to meet and they'll

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,510
respond

00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,950
second you could say hey I saw a project

00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,240
you did on github would love to pick

00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,070
your brain on something I'm working on

00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,900
if this doesn't get the person's

00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,100
attention I'm not sure what well no but

00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,240
seriously in this message you're

00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,770
basically saying that's a really

00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,940
freaking cool project and I think you're

00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:56,290
cool let's nerd out together

00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:58,270
and third you could say I saw that

00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,580
you're an organizer for X Y Z meetup do

00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,570
you have do you need any volunteers

00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,220
meetups and conferences are always

00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:05,470
looking for volunteers this allows you

00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,210
to get in the in in the in and since

00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:11,430
meetup and conference organizers usually

00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:11,430
do need help they'll most likely respond

00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,500
so now this one is for standing I went

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,930
starting a company and trying to get

00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,670
clients do not send a long-winded email

00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:23,790
I can't tell you how many emails I get

00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:25,630
from people trying to sell me stuff

00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,460
similar just reaching out to the hiring

00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:29,020
manager don't send a long-winded email

00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,460
about how you can help them they are

00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,490
hounded all day and night by people

00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,180
sending emails about stuff that doesn't

00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:37,930
even make sense

00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:39,339
keep it short and sweet - do not mention

00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,440
anything about the fact you want them as

00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:43,180
a client you need to let them think it's

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,620
their idea you need to meet with them

00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,200
get to know them and not talk about

00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,290
business I'll go into how to nail the

00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,790
in-person meeting in the next slide

00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:54,820
three attend as many events as you can

00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:56,260
it's cliche cliche I know and it's

00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,700
easier said than done but it's so

00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:01,480
important to get out there and meet

00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:04,170
people make friends 4 do not be afraid

00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,520
to reach out to the CEO of the company

00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:08,560
keep in mind and this is something that

00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,970
I say to myself all the time and say to

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,170
other people is that you can't leave

00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,550
something that was never yours to begin

00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:14,020
with

00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:15,880
so when going in for the interview are

00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,040
going in to me you know CEO we're

00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,910
reaching out you know you you never knew

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:24,970
them in the first place so you're not

00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:26,529
losing anything examples when meeting

00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,970
with a potential client ask them more

00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:28,990
questions about themselves in return

00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,880
they'll ask you questions that that

00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,610
allows both of you to both build rapport

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,170
you could say something like so how did

00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:36,940
you get started as started in this

00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:39,130
industry always great to meet fellow

00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,230
entrepreneurs people love to talk about

00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,400
themselves so this one is good because

00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,750
you get to learn their personal story

00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:48,100
and understand them on another level a

00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:50,440
question that I love asking is do you

00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,640
love it that doesn't give them much time

00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,519
to really think about it

00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:58,630
and so you get a very raw response and

00:14:54,519 --> 00:15:02,079
it gets some thinking 2/3 so who is your

00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:03,640
target client I'd love to see who I know

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,070
who could maybe utilize a service like

00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:08,079
yours this is good because it allows you

00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:09,820
to be looked at as someone who can add

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,790
value beyond what your business actually

00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:14,410
does for example I had a client who was

00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,180
working on a time line app basically

00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,829
using predictive analytics to predict an

00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,230
issue before it came up using data

00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:21,670
collected along the way and then took on

00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,350
a new client who was building something

00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,240
similar but in a different industry and

00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:27,160
they were having issues solving a

00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,230
similar problem that the client had

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,570
already solved I connected the dots and

00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:33,100
made an intro between both CEOs and now

00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:35,260
they license out their softer and are

00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:39,519
working together I did not get a cut of

00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:41,079
that it's important to always look at

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,760
the big picture beyond what is just in

00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:48,459
front of you standing out when asking

00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,140
for money from investors a question that

00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:53,019
I often get is how did you get an

00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:56,079
investment or how do you stand out with

00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:59,620
investors in a saturated market just

00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:02,529
don't don't ask for money investors

00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:04,480
often invest in people not their ideas

00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:08,079
necessarily they need someone who they

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,430
trust and can execute the idea when

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,630
meeting with an investor get to know

00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,430
them the same way I told you about

00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:15,519
getting to know client or a candidate or

00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:17,260
a friend build a relationship with them

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,839
on a human level do not mention that

00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,190
you're seeking a round of funding let

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,990
them get to know you learn the

00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,329
challenges you're having an offer to

00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:28,690
invest themselves let them think it's

00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:35,050
their idea that's how my mom managed me

00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:36,519
growing up and now this doesn't apply to

00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,870
every business but if you're just

00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:40,720
getting started or you're looking for

00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:42,459
new clients or you know even they may

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,820
know some investors I've seen it work

00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,820
many times

00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:51,760
in conclusion giving a damn plus

00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:56,020
standing out equals the amber effect I

00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:58,920
think be human treat other humans like

00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:07,120
humans and the rest will follow

00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:10,510
thank you hi that was that was awesome

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,220
and what do you think of like there's

00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:13,990
some people that you have a connection

00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,250
with immediately and that's awesome and

00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,530
sometimes you're like hey I'd like to

00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:20,020
work together and you can take that

00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:21,850
energy and then sometimes working with

00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:25,240
people is like an arranged marriage too

00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:27,610
so like well we're forced to be here

00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,470
every day and then a relationship can

00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:31,030
girl from that so how do you kind of

00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,700
there's that that's kind of two

00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:34,870
different ways that people can work

00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,850
together you can have that energy and

00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:40,690
work together or work together and then

00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:44,230
a relationship can grow because I like

00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:48,220
this idea of connection where I work at

00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:50,020
a big organization where they just all

00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,550
the stuff comes through HR and I took

00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,679
like the back door in because I

00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:55,570
networked my way in and that just seems

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:59,050
like such animal organic way of

00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:01,300
connecting people and you know bringing

00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:03,070
a person in instead of just this piece

00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,320
of paper you know somebody in trying to

00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,910
see if just everything qualifies in that

00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,280
way and so kind of really bringing the

00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:13,150
people and the relationship back into a

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,429
career setting yeah absolutely I think I

00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:17,320
am an HR managers worst nightmare

00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:22,360
because I do things very unconventional

00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:25,990
and I I don't think I shouldn't say this

00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:28,840
but going to through HR I think you

00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:31,000
should probably avoid a most cost I

00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,440
think because a lot of a lot of it

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,110
there's a lot of like red tape and stuff

00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,030
and you know they don't always know the

00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,050
whole situation of the person and you're

00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:40,720
right they're looking at a piece of

00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:42,429
paper and not you know the actual person

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,040
their ID you know they're proof like who

00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:47,050
they are as a person beyond just the

00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:50,140
technical skills you know from a social

00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:51,970
like a soft skill standpoint I think

00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,800
always try to go to the back door if you

00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:55,320
can I know I'm a recruiter I probably

00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,740
shouldn't be saying this but

00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:00,540
at all cut I wouldn't unless it's me I

00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,370
wouldn't go through you know anyone if

00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:05,460
you can figure out a way to get in and

00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:07,080
there are ways to get in like simply I

00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,700
just had a friend of mine send a message

00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,040
to someone a company in New York that

00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,570
she's trying to get into and she said

00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:15,030
hey I'd like to pick your brain on

00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:17,190
something you know about whatever and

00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:19,050
this is the hiring manager that

00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:22,080
literally I know friends that have

00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:23,340
applied and never got back to them so

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,190
there's definitely a ways to go around

00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:28,980
it and I'd be happy to help anyone you

00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:31,590
know kind of navigate through that and

00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,880
I've done answers your question so you

00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:35,400
have a really interesting journey that

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,570
this is really awesome I guess through

00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:41,730
all this process that you went through

00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:43,980
becoming your own entrepreneur looking

00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:46,110
back were there anything that you would

00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,580
do differently or some lessons that you

00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,800
learned away along the way that you

00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:53,430
would share with us oh yeah absolutely

00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:56,070
every single day you definitely learn a

00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:57,870
lot along the way and I've made many

00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,700
mistakes and I think obviously like the

00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:02,610
cliche answer is to just learn from them

00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:04,170
but also talk to other entrepreneurs and

00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:05,400
understand kind of what struggles they

00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,140
might have gone through and stuff so you

00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,580
know that you're not alone I feel like

00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,890
it's you know kind of being an

00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,630
entrepreneur a CEO it kind of gets

00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,190
lonely sometimes

00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,660
because not all of your friends and

00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:19,830
stuff understand like the lifestyle that

00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:21,540
you're you have but yeah and I also

00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,160
would recommend listening to podcasts

00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:26,490
and reading books you know I read the

00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:28,490
book good degree that helped me you know

00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:30,450
in starting the company and everything

00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:31,770
you're always gonna learn stuff along

00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:34,860
the way I know my investors are like

00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:36,180
amber if you do that one more time you

00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,070
know and that's the thing like keeping

00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:40,710
the expectations for the investors as

00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,910
well as yourself you know and really

00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:44,790
taking care of yourself I think that's

00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:47,100
something that the first two three years

00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:48,600
I kind of didn't do I just ran straight

00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,340
through and I was like all right I'm

00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,130
doing this and I did like barely got any

00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:54,960
sleep finally this last year I took time

00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,740
for you know for myself but you still

00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,870
need to make sure you hit your

00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:02,460
deliverables and everything yeah like

00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:04,830
maybe this is a weird question under

00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:07,290
this context but have you ever come

00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,550
across people who didn't feel confident

00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:10,770
to be

00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:12,600
the founder of a company of her CEO but

00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,429
thought they had an idea that was worth

00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,830
pursuing and was trying to find someone

00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:21,059
to engage with that idea just because

00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:22,350
they thought it was important I mean I

00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:25,140
definitely meet a lot of people with

00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:26,580
really good ideas I think like for me

00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:29,429
when I started my company I just didn't

00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:31,290
even think I just did it and I now

00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:33,300
looking back I'm like if I thought about

00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:36,480
it I would've over thought it over and

00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:38,190
over and over again and you know kind of

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,470
like when I first started some you know

00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:42,330
people did doubt you know candidate and

00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:44,360
what we were doing and and you know they

00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:47,880
still do you know from time to time but

00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:50,630
more people than not didn't and believed

00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:53,280
in it and so I kind of rode with that

00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:55,140
but I think if you have an idea you know

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,150
run it by people with candidate I

00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,770
actually before I started the company I

00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,360
went to tech events and I started taking

00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:01,230
surveys and polls and collecting the

00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,750
data of people that would actually

00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:05,490
utilize a service like this and so I had

00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:08,309
that data to kind of reassure me when I

00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,990
was doubting myself but yeah if you have

00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:11,340
an idea you know go for it

00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,080
do your market research and make sure

00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,520
you know either no one else is doing it

00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,900
or whatever it may be it or you can do

00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:22,200
it better yeah thank you for the great

00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:26,309
talk I'm interested in knowing how my

00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:28,920
show business is grown especially on the

00:22:26,309 --> 00:22:34,110
intersection of recruitment in the image

00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:35,400
making side of things yeah so I mean I

00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:37,620
came from the background I mean I came

00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,120
from a sociology background so like I

00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,650
kind of fell into recruiting and I it

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,870
was more so because I just loved helping

00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:45,270
people fulfill you know their goals and

00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:49,590
everything and I just I saw how ruthless

00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:51,360
of a world the recruiting is and you

00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:53,220
know I wanted to change that and so that

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,679
was my background is really building a

00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:57,450
foundation in Philadelphia for the

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,610
recruiting side to be you know different

00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:01,620
Avenue for developers who you know come

00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:03,600
into our city and don't know anyone

00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:05,580
that's one of the reasons also I started

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,990
the dating side and everything in the

00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,130
social side was because people were

00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:09,330
moving to the city they didn't know

00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:12,030
anyone so we were introducing them to a

00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:14,760
social aspect of you know of their life

00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:17,700
but yeah I didn't I'm not a matchmaker

00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,169
by any stretch of the imagination but I

00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,480
just knew so many people and I was I

00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:22,340
listened to them

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,470
and so when I listening to them I kind

00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,850
of matched that with you know people I

00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:28,100
thought they could be good for and users

00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:30,950
always trial and error no one's perfect

00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:32,450
but you know we keep learning and

00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:34,190
growing from it we've changed a couple

00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,510
things along the way and we can't it

00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:39,230
will probably change them a hundred

00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:40,640
times more but yeah I mean right now you

00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:44,179
know we're we are eventually looking to

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,700
expand to other cities you know I think

00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:48,320
kind of to touch on the other thing

00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,640
being four years old I did have kind of

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,929
one of those moments where I was like oh

00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,350
man we have not accomplished what I

00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:55,400
wanted to accomplish in four years and

00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:57,110
you know it just kind of take a step

00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,160
back and really kind of evaluate the

00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,940
business and make sure that we're on the

00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,360
right track

00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:03,910
great talk by the way I wanted to ask

00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,799
you specifically about the whole

00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:08,600
outreach aspect you know reaching out to

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,280
another person like they're an actual

00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:14,900
human being and you give a rip about

00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:17,780
them that's always no that's even that's

00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:20,660
not guaranteed to work so what would you

00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:22,100
recommend doing in response when you try

00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,110
to message them on LinkedIn or send an

00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:26,690
email and then you get nothing back do

00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:29,660
you persist do you send out another

00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:33,620
email every week do you take the hint

00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:36,860
and move on I've been told the

00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:38,960
persistence one in particular is like a

00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:42,410
regular recommendation in multiple

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,660
places to take so the message is that

00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:46,760
you're sending are they ones like hey

00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,410
you look cool I think we should me or

00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,030
are they like hi I saw you think you

00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:51,679
have this job and I'd like to meet with

00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:54,260
you because but you know I think my

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,000
skill set but like it's that kind of

00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,590
because what those kind of messages do

00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,510
not normally get a response because

00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:01,340
they're getting a hundred of them but if

00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:03,500
you like tweak your message just a

00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:05,840
little bit and say something like that's

00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:08,240
kind of just a little bit different you

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,190
know I've seen it work many times but

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,000
other than that like in terms of you

00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,320
know getting in touch with them like

00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,309
find out what they're into I mean if

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:18,290
they're you know into I don't know I had

00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:21,730
someone once I knew the manager was

00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:25,940
really and really into crazy socks and

00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:27,350
so I had the guy we're crazy saw he went

00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,299
to the office and wear these crazy socks

00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:30,900
that said hire me and it had the guy's

00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:33,150
picture on the front of them

00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:36,480
I was gonna bring them today but I

00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:38,550
forgot very upset about that but like

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,540
just doing different like things to

00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:43,920
stand out messaging you know on LinkedIn

00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,330
doesn't doesn't always work but like

00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,430
find out maybe what meetups and stuff

00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:49,560
they go to I don't know if that helps it

00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:51,650
doesn't work all the time but it works

00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:55,620
better than just sending an application

00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:58,320
and and also like you know maybe create

00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:00,900
your own Meetup because if it's maybe an

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,090
in like a technology like Jenga say

00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:05,750
there's no django meetup in whatever

00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:08,010
area you're in if you start meetup and

00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:09,240
you're talking to the hiring manager or

00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:12,210
whatever you're like hey yeah I run

00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,670
django made up in whatever area you know

00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:18,780
they may be more inclined to reach back

00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:21,000
out yeah I just had a question about the

00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:28,620
other part which is coming out of person

00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:29,850
with no motive I guess so that is really

00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,710
funny because when I was preparing for

00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:35,820
this talk I was like me talking about

00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:39,180
being genuine makes it disingenuous and

00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:42,600
I was like how do I go about that I

00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:44,970
think just you have to always like you

00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,880
just can't expect something out of it

00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:50,400
like just do like offer to help with

00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:53,400
whatever like for example you know like

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:58,860
I wanted to work with the.net code camp

00:26:53,400 --> 00:27:00,090
in the Poconos and I knew that you know

00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,730
I really wanted to talk to the organizer

00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:04,110
because you know they are hiring or

00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:06,360
whatever I wanted to get in in with them

00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:09,900
so I reached out and I was like hi hi hi

00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:11,850
can I volunteer can I help and even

00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:14,310
though my ultimate motive is to end up

00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:16,170
working with them even if it didn't end

00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:17,610
up working out like you still got

00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:19,350
something like you're networking you're

00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:21,570
meeting people like just don't

00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:22,980
necessarily like take it as a bad as a

00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,540
negative if it doesn't work out the way

00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,010
that you actually wanted to because it

00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:32,160
could end up working out in a different

00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:33,330
way well thank you so much amber let's

00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,630
all give me a more another round of

00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,630
applause

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,109
