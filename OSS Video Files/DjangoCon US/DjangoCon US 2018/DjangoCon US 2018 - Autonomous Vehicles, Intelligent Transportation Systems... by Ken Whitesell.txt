[Music]

00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:20,939
good afternoon thanks for the

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,830
introduction my name's Ken white Saul

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,180
I'm here to talk about autonomous

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,300
vehicles intelligent transportation

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,550
systems and yes Django so over the next

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:33,149
four hours I will be discussing all of

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:37,640
these and great huh what Oh 25 minutes

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:40,980
not 250 okay we'll make that fit

00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,190
currently I'm employed by WSP USA in

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,649
their traffic engineering department and

00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:48,870
we work with municipalities who are

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:51,000
working with the research that's

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,879
actively going on in these various areas

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,969
I'll start out with a simple disclaimer

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:59,489
that I know very little about the

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:01,829
autonomous vehicle research itself

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,780
everything that I know about that is the

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,670
publicly available information that you

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,439
can find on the Internet so I'm not

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,479
going to be spending a whole lot of time

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,450
on that maybe just bringing some topics

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,250
to your attention my own particular area

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:19,460
of expertise is in the intelligent

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,460
transportation systems and then Django

00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,950
in the autonomous vehicle area they

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,119
actually recognize five different levels

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:33,090
of autonomy for automobiles the sixth of

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:36,170
course being at the top no automation at

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:39,020
all your typical garden-variety car and

00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:41,880
what you will find is that in different

00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:44,280
contexts and different situations that

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,530
there is actually a mix of different

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,700
levels being worked on there are a lot

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:54,090
of vehicles today that are working along

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,100
at level two and in some case level

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,670
three some partial automation some

00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,680
conditional automation where you see the

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,799
ads and perhaps even have a car that

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,570
have the blind spot warnings or there's

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,420
certainly the commercials that you see

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:12,690
on television with the assisted braking

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,280
and all of the other safety facilities

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,490
that are being

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,500
built into cars that's going to continue

00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:20,630
to evolve and adapt and yes these

00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,790
features keep getting added more and

00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,860
more vehicles are getting these

00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:28,100
different features built in as the

00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:30,830
manufacturers continue to work on making

00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:34,700
this technology available and usable and

00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:37,670
practical at a price that people can

00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:40,550
actually afford the Holy Grail of course

00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:43,700
is to get down to full automation where

00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:46,310
you get into a vehicle and without a

00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:49,070
driver without any manual intervention

00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:53,110
at all it takes you from your source to

00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:56,420
your destination we're not there yet

00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:59,540
we're not close to there yet and I'll

00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:03,910
talk about that a little bit more part

00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:06,650
of what makes this such a difficult

00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,810
facility to provide is that there's

00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:13,060
really a lot of electronics there's a

00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:15,709
lot of Technology to make a vehicle

00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,269
sufficiently aware of its environment to

00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:19,970
where it can interact with its

00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:22,970
environment and successfully navigate

00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:27,019
what passes for roads in large parts of

00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:30,350
the country Adie automotive have done a

00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:32,299
diagram for showing just some of the

00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:35,299
electronics that are involved would they

00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:39,170
use in terms of creating a web of

00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:42,130
sensors around the vehicle to allow it

00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:45,440
to detect the environment that it's in

00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:48,079
starting from a long-range radar that

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,920
gets its its distance view allows it to

00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:54,890
forecast traffic and and situations that

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,220
are coming up in front identifying where

00:03:54,890 --> 00:04:03,440
the road curves where there might be

00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:05,870
obstacles in front of you lidar for

00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,600
those of you who are not aware radar of

00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:12,049
course stands for radio detection and

00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:15,500
ranging lidar is actually a laser based

00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:17,630
equivalent it is high-energy pulses of a

00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:21,320
much shorter range of a much finer

00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:24,710
granularity and gets a more sharp

00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,160
picture but at a corresponding loss in

00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,410
effective range

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,310
and certainly more power required to

00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:34,820
interpret that you also have visual

00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:38,100
cameras that are capable of detecting

00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:41,130
light electromagnetic radiation in the

00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:45,050
visible wavelengths and can possibly

00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:49,170
recognize some vehicles or other

00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:52,230
attributes of the road aspects of the

00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:54,330
road that it needs to be aware of then

00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:58,530
really close there are short range

00:04:54,330 --> 00:05:02,340
radars and even ultrasound for things

00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:03,630
like parking assist sure most of you may

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,730
have even seen the television

00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:08,280
commercials where the person pulls up

00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:12,750
next to a parallel parking spot and hits

00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:15,600
a button and the car backs its way into

00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,910
the appropriate sized spot without

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,480
hitting any of the adjacent vehicles and

00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:25,590
so just like bats use ultrasound for

00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:28,950
very short-range detection of very small

00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:33,060
objects cars have that some cars that do

00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:36,240
that sort of close range assistance will

00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:40,260
use that facility as well but it's not

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,400
perfect so far there have been to my

00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,490
knowledge the extent of my knowledge

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,500
which by no means is exhaustive but

00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:51,000
there are have been at least four

00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:53,700
traffic fatalities caused by the

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,240
autonomy within a vehicle there have

00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:59,580
been other vehicular deaths of course

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,680
involving autonomous vehicles but the

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,710
ones that I have found aside from these

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,290
for the cause has not been the autonomy

00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:09,600
in the vehicle itself these are the four

00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,730
that I'm aware of where they have said

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,760
you know there is a has been a breakdown

00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:16,919
in the autonomy of the car itself its

00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,650
ability to detect and interact with its

00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:21,300
environment probably most everyone and I

00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,190
know the one that's probably received

00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,980
the most attention was the pedestrian

00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:28,470
that was involved in the accident in

00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:30,450
Arizona earlier this year pedestrian

00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:32,610
walking a bicycle across the street at

00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:36,800
night the car just did not detect it and

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:39,630
the lady unfortunately was struck

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,960
similar type situation in California in

00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,509
this

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,430
a month overshadowed because it was not

00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:47,610
a pedestrian it was the driver in this

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:51,380
case who was killed the car itself

00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:54,120
steered into a concrete jersey wall and

00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:56,520
hit the end of the jersey wall straight

00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,220
on did not detect that the jersey wall

00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:03,780
was channeling traffic to one side or

00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:05,699
the other and hit it straight on the one

00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:10,710
that I find most interesting though

00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:13,440
personally in May of 2016 a car drove

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:15,419
under a tractor-trailer and this one

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,220
highlights to me some of the real

00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:19,860
difficulties of working within the

00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:23,160
environment because the situation is is

00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:25,080
that a car was driving up a hill and at

00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,840
the top of the hill at a cross street

00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,539
was a tractor-trailer in the middle of

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,849
the intersection and it just so happened

00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:35,789
that based upon the angle of the Sun and

00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:38,159
the position of the truck the white

00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:41,159
panels of the truck blended in with the

00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:44,070
sky background the wheels blended in

00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:45,750
with the terrain behind it and so the

00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:48,389
vehicle was completely unable to

00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:50,580
recognize that there was actually an

00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:51,240
obstacle in its way it thought that the

00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,090
trailer

00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,150
was just part of the background sky and

00:07:54,090 --> 00:08:00,060
so the vehicle came up the hill tried to

00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:06,419
cross underneath the truck and caused

00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:09,150
the accident so what we're looking at at

00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:11,969
WSP and numerous other places around the

00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:14,219
country is an intelligent transportation

00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:16,740
system that helps account for some of

00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:18,599
these deficiencies some of these lacks

00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,849
some of these gaps between what the

00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:24,030
technology can do has been shown to do

00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:26,280
and where it needs to be but in

00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:29,159
actuality an intelligent transportation

00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,380
system is actually the older technology

00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:34,380
the initiatives for intelligent

00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:37,829
transportation goes back to the mid 80s

00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:40,260
some of you may be aware that most

00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:43,229
emergency responders first responders

00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:46,950
police cars fires fire trucks ambulances

00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:50,160
in most cases have a signal override

00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:52,740
button that they can hit a transceiver

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,340
hit some some device in their vehicle

00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:58,330
that causes the

00:08:54,340 --> 00:09:01,150
upcoming traffic signal to change to

00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:04,060
give them the green and to block traffic

00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:06,970
in the other directions so this is work

00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,950
that started back almost 30 years ago

00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:13,150
actually now probably more than 30 years

00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:15,730
ago the idea with all of this is to look

00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:18,070
at transportation as a whole as a

00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:20,529
complete system not just looking at one

00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:23,370
part or another but looking at the whole

00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:25,930
of transportation how do we optimize

00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:28,680
moving people from one location to

00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:32,320
another accounting for all modes of

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,670
transportation that's the intent the

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,440
idea behind the intelligent

00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:40,990
transportation systems so the end state

00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,910
that the industry the automotive

00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:46,450
industry and the engineering industry

00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:48,880
that is working towards is a connected

00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:51,790
automation is getting the two modes

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,620
these two particular modes cars and the

00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:56,350
infrastructure to work together to

00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,660
everybody's benefit so that the vehicles

00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:00,490
are not just relying upon their own

00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:03,040
information that they can detect from

00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:06,280
their own sensors but can talk to other

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,860
vehicles that are on the road and talk

00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:11,830
to the traffic lights and talk to the

00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,690
traffic the intersections talk to the

00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:16,270
infrastructure itself talked to the

00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:20,020
roads when you look at it from that

00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:22,150
perspective a whole large range of

00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,580
applications actually become available

00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:28,330
now time prohibits me from going through

00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:30,820
all of these these are long and this is

00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:33,580
an evening the exhaustive list but these

00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,980
are the applications that can take

00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:38,339
advantage of that or envisioned to take

00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:41,770
advantage of that cooperation between

00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:43,720
the vehicles and the infrastructure and

00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:45,700
a couple of them that I'll point out

00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,690
some of them one of them I've already

00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:51,820
mentioned the emergency signaling being

00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:55,900
one forward collision warning you see

00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:58,990
television ads for that Iko Iko Lane

00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:02,200
management Eco speed harmonization when

00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,610
you have large fleets of trucks when you

00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:08,029
have trucks say that are making

00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:10,649
deliveries the local your local FedEx

00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:14,009
distributor is sending out all of their

00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:16,709
trucks that's a lot of gasoline that is

00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:19,049
a lot of fuel that is being burnt with

00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:20,789
those vehicles just sitting at traffic

00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:23,849
lights waiting to make their way out in

00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:26,849
traffic so what if we respond to the

00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:28,889
fact that we know that FedEx is putting

00:11:26,849 --> 00:11:31,409
a hundred trucks out onto the road

00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:33,299
at 4 a.m. in the morning and now we

00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:35,729
change the traffic lights so that we

00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:38,999
give extended greens to their primary

00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:43,849
arteries to get them out and about where

00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:43,849
they need to be quicker faster and safer

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,439
pedestrian warnings I know it's up there

00:11:47,729 --> 00:11:52,649
somewhere I'm not seeing it right off

00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:54,989
the top of my head we are working on an

00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:57,599
application I'll have a chance to talk

00:11:54,989 --> 00:11:59,339
about it a little bit later but dealing

00:11:57,599 --> 00:12:02,249
with pedestrians and pedestrians

00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:04,379
signaling right now you're familiar with

00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:06,149
the crosswalk buttons here in the United

00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:08,669
States a pedestrian walks up to an

00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:11,489
intersection hits the button to cross

00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:13,429
the street at some point in time it'll

00:12:11,489 --> 00:12:16,799
allow the light to change

00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:18,479
give them the walk signal and then the

00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,819
countdown timer for clearing that

00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:26,279
intersection and then changing it back

00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:29,100
again back to the automobile side and

00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:31,619
this is about to the extent that I'm

00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,839
aware of the technology within the

00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:36,419
automobile system within the automobile

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,579
electronics there is already a network

00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:42,959
and it's called a controller area

00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:45,029
network or a can bus can network that

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:48,629
exists in every automobile that has been

00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:51,269
manufactured in the United States since

00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:53,879
I think it's 2002 when it became

00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:55,949
required and you will find underneath

00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:59,129
your dashboard you will find a plug

00:12:55,949 --> 00:13:00,749
interface that matches that plug shown

00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:03,269
at the top where you can plug devices

00:13:00,749 --> 00:13:05,369
into it you take your car to an auto

00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:08,879
mechanic you get the engine warning

00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:11,609
light and you can plug a device into

00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,979
that that's attaching almost directly to

00:13:11,609 --> 00:13:16,909
the can bus and you can read the cars

00:13:13,979 --> 00:13:20,790
computers to get your diagnostic codes

00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:23,490
the intelligent infrastructure the

00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:25,800
ability for the cards to communicate

00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:32,220
also just become another component that

00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:34,680
get added to this bus where I get most

00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,740
involved with then is the infrastructure

00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,270
side the intelligent infrastructure side

00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:41,010
starting on the far side it all begins

00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:44,040
with the traffic light we have traffic

00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:46,020
signals that are designed to restrict

00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,720
and control the flow of traffic through

00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:50,400
an intersection communicating with that

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,730
traffic light is a traffic signal

00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:56,340
controller pre abbreviated TS see that

00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:59,790
traffic signal controller identifies the

00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:03,060
timing that each light is in a

00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:05,610
particular state and those are very

00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,680
sophisticated electronic devices most of

00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:10,770
them have at least one or two CPUs in

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,230
them running programs that can control

00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:16,130
the traffic cycle and that includes

00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:20,130
things like being able to adapt the

00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:24,560
times for the cycles based on time of

00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:27,650
day or day of week or any other sorts of

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:31,170
conditions that you wish to put into it

00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:34,230
but the problem with that or the

00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:38,730
limitation with that is that these exist

00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:42,780
out at the traffic signals in any modern

00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:45,450
generation of intersection in the United

00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:48,660
States you will find at one of the four

00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:51,480
corners you'll find a steel cabinet that

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:54,060
is probably almost the size of the

00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,800
podium here and they're either mounted

00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,750
on the ground or in some cases they are

00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,630
mounted on the poles but you'll usually

00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:02,520
find them at one corner of the

00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:05,790
intersection look for them the next time

00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:08,970
you're at a traffic light and if you do

00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:10,950
find it that TSC is one of the devices

00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:13,050
that's going to be in that cabinet and

00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:17,280
it's what's actually controlling the

00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:18,990
signaling of the traffic signal so what

00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,570
we're adding to that what's being added

00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:23,730
to that in the connected vehicle

00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:27,330
environment are the roadside units or

00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:29,160
rsu's they are radio transceivers that

00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:31,020
they have to be mounted high because

00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,590
they're what's actually sending the

00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:35,570
radio signals to the cars

00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:39,770
that are approaching in any area of the

00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:42,050
intersection so you will find them you

00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:44,600
may find them they are about the size of

00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:46,370
a typical laptop a little bit thick or

00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,380
maybe the size of the projector sitting

00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:51,980
out front and you can occasionally see

00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:54,200
them mounted on the arm that comes out

00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,600
from the side where the traffic lights

00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,370
themselves are mounted or if they use

00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,070
the wires to hang the lights you might

00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:03,830
find it on the pole itself but it's a

00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:06,290
relatively small box and that's

00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:08,180
communicating with the traffic signal

00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:11,870
controller to distribute information

00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:14,120
about that intersection I'm staying at

00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:16,790
the top here there's a protocol that's

00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:20,320
used called DSRC direct short range

00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:23,420
communications which is operating in the

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:26,420
5.9 gigahertz band for you radio geeks

00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:31,010
out there and it is designed as a

00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:34,340
short-range radio network between cars

00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:36,620
and these RS use the cars can tell the

00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:39,380
intersection that it's coming the

00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:41,390
intersection can tell the cars this

00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:45,530
green light is going to become red

00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:47,570
within the next five seconds or this red

00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:50,270
light is going to change to green within

00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:52,970
the next five seconds that sort of

00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:56,060
detailed information allows the car

00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:59,540
allows it possible for the car to adjust

00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:01,820
itself its speed in traffic to optimize

00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:05,480
its travel through that particular

00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:08,990
intersection all of the messages that

00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:11,360
can be sent between the RSU and the

00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:16,790
vehicles are defined in a standard

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:18,709
called J 27:35 it lists actually I think

00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:21,650
it's in the neighborhood of 15 different

00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:23,990
types of messages that an RS you can

00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:26,540
send to a vehicle that a vehicle consent

00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,940
to an RSU or that a vehicle can send to

00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:31,910
another vehicle three that I'm going to

00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:34,550
mention here right now our B SMS that's

00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:37,550
a basic safety message that's the car

00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:40,010
saying this is my location in GPS

00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:44,270
coordinates latitude and longitude this

00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:45,950
is my velocity this is my heaven being

00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:49,520
radio these

00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:52,550
broadcast everywhere so every not just

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,730
the RSU but every vehicle within range

00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:59,150
is also capable of receiving that radio

00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:01,310
broadcast and so every car can detect

00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:03,830
where every car is around it based upon

00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:09,770
these basic safety messages that are

00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:12,620
being exchanged the map message is a map

00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:14,360
it is a a representation of the

00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:17,210
intersection and I have a diagram for

00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:19,610
that coming up shortly that allows a car

00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:22,220
to know what is the layout of this

00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:24,770
intersection that I'm approaching is it

00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:27,950
one lane wide two lanes wide three lanes

00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,600
wide and can I make a left turn do I

00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,140
have to go straight do I have to make a

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,180
right turn

00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,010
do I have one right-hand turn lanes to

00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:36,140
right-hand turn lanes all of that

00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:39,380
information is encoded within these map

00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:41,600
messages working along with the map is

00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:44,750
what's known as the spat that stands for

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,180
signal phase and timing and that is what

00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:49,670
is describing what the current state is

00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:51,500
of the traffic signal controller and the

00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,780
traffic light and it includes

00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,610
information such as what is the current

00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:58,370
color of the light is your light

00:18:55,610 --> 00:19:00,710
currently green yellow or red and when

00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:03,920
it is going to change and how soon is it

00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:08,150
going to change information useful from

00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:12,080
the car from the RSU to the car there is

00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:13,640
also a reverse message name escapes me

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,660
at the moment I didn't think to include

00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:20,810
it that a car can request a light change

00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:22,160
from an intersection and so as the cars

00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:25,010
approaching there is a particular

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,350
message that the car can send saying I'm

00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:29,930
approaching this intersection how soon

00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:33,020
can you change the light for me and so

00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:36,140
it is possible for the RSU communicating

00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:39,080
with the TSC to say how busy are we is

00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:42,110
it appropriate for me to change this

00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,580
light ahead of cycle to short cycle the

00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:47,390
light and get it to where the

00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:50,110
approaching vehicle can get a green what

00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:53,180
we're adding particularly to this

00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:55,640
environment is a computer that you see

00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:58,040
down in the middle that uses a protocol

00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,730
known as SNMP simple network management

00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:05,210
recall the protocol itself dates back oh

00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:07,610
it least to the 80s that is a management

00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:10,130
protocol it's a way of communicating

00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:13,460
with devices to configure those devices

00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:14,960
and I have nightmares about SNMP and the

00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:18,920
less I say about it here the better off

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:22,190
I'm going to be one of the facilities

00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:24,710
however that is also possible is that

00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:27,140
that computer can send what's known as

00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:31,370
an I FM or an immediate forward message

00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:33,920
to the RSU that that is a message that

00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:36,740
then can go out over the radio so not

00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,930
only does the RSU take messages from the

00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:41,660
traffic signal controller but it can

00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:45,200
also take messages from a computer to be

00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:47,030
broadcast out and there are many types

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,060
of messages that can be sent out from

00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:52,490
the computer out to the vehicles one of

00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:54,680
them that we are working on specifically

00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:58,430
and I alluded to this earlier is a

00:20:54,680 --> 00:21:01,040
pedestrian safety message of PSM we have

00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:04,750
developed an app that if you're running

00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:09,100
the app as you approach an intersection

00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:11,660
the your GPS locator within your phone

00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:14,000
detects when you were are within the

00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:17,180
range of a monitored intersection and

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,830
start sending messages start sending

00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:26,600
brief packets to the computer system

00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:28,250
through a web style interface message

00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,320
package saying I'm approaching an

00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:34,250
intersection this is where I am this is

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:36,200
my speed this is my heading and at the

00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,970
appropriate time once that connections

00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,450
been established and there start to be

00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:42,920
some communication the computer system

00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:45,440
that is part of this the web server

00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,240
involved in this will then start

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,390
generating the pedestrian safety

00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:53,240
messages out to the RSU to be sent out

00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:55,970
to the cars so as you are walking up to

00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:59,210
an intersection the car starts to become

00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:02,360
aware of your location and send that out

00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:03,950
now the only thing that is sent is your

00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,690
GPS coordinates there's nothing

00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,580
identifiable about the phone that we're

00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:09,830
sending we're just sending the smallest

00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,690
possible packet that says there is a

00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:14,200
pedestrian at

00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:16,900
these GPS coordinates and so when you

00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:19,090
actually step off the sidewalk into the

00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:21,070
road that's when the car should take

00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:23,770
more notice of it when you're just at

00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:25,510
the side of the road the car can be

00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:32,620
advised of it but should not necessarily

00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:35,260
take action so I mentioned briefly the

00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:38,260
map messages that get sent out they are

00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:40,240
very detailed representation of an

00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:42,700
intersection identifying each and every

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,430
lane what the direction of travel is

00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:47,200
that is allowed for that Lane weather

00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,940
and what motions you can take whether

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,880
you can go straight make a right turn

00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:54,280
make a left turn make a left turn except

00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:58,810
from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. Monday through

00:22:54,280 --> 00:23:02,410
Friday all of these various conditions

00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:04,930
and constraints something I learned

00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:08,290
little trivia fact and you know anybody

00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:12,870
who's done real GIS work graphic

00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:19,680
information network geographical work is

00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:24,880
that roads move because of foot 8 plate

00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:27,880
tectonics a given geographical location

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,400
measured GPS coordinate will change year

00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,740
after year and in some places in some

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:37,450
locations on the order of centimeters

00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:40,630
per year over time that can accrue and

00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:44,440
build up and become a real problem part

00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:46,260
of the messaging set are adjustment

00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,800
factors part of those radio

00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:53,260
communications are we have told the

00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:57,040
radio that it's in this location but now

00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:58,810
it's in this location and those

00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:02,740
adjustment factors are factored into

00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:06,610
these messages managing all of these

00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:09,280
devices if you had to actually go out to

00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:11,320
every box in the field would be very

00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:15,220
time-consuming and impractical to make

00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:17,440
it at all dynamic and where does janggo

00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,260
fit into this well what we have done is

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,180
we have created a set of management

00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:24,820
applications that allow us to configure

00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:29,290
and alter and Mae

00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:34,330
and RSU from the traffic engineer

00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:35,950
central location yes this is probably

00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:37,660
one of the world's ugliest sights of

00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:41,530
Tracy Osborne we're here she'd be like

00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:43,540
and I thought you read my book I can say

00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:47,500
this predates her book but that's beside

00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:49,420
the point it's a very simple app we show

00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:52,990
what different types of applications are

00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:55,960
configured for a particular RSU and when

00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:59,020
you click on the simple little icon you

00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:03,850
can I've got slides out of order here

00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:06,670
how wonderful you go to the specific

00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:09,130
details of that particular RSU and you

00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:12,820
can see everything that the traffic

00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:15,150
engineer needs to see to work with that

00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:20,050
particular RSU or the particular app

00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:22,690
application running on it one of the

00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:24,940
features of ipv6 you'll notice that all

00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:26,860
of these addresses here are ipv6 because

00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,720
of the number of devices in the way of

00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,880
networking

00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:34,179
everything is ipv6 and that's created

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:38,590
some interesting issues with not every

00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:40,870
tool being exactly ipv6 friendly ipv6

00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:43,660
has the very handy feature that within

00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:46,570
your local broadcast domain it requires

00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:48,970
every device on that domain to respond

00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:51,010
and so what we're actually capable of

00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:53,230
doing is doing an interrogation of every

00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:56,140
broadcast domain and saying are you a

00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:58,450
device on this network it is supposed to

00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:00,400
respond we get that information back and

00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:03,400
we can actually use that as part of our

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:05,110
Diagnostics to determine we expected

00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,300
such-and-such a device at a particular

00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:09,070
address to respond it doesn't respond

00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:16,390
there's now something wrong with that

00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:18,450
device I mentioned the map messages that

00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:21,520
payload section air is the hex dump

00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:26,470
representation of about a third of a map

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:28,920
message they can get very intricate the

00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:31,809
other application that we use is

00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:33,880
analyzing some of the data now being

00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:36,140
part of a research firm we're working

00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,240
with the University of Michigan

00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:42,500
Transportation Research Institute um

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:44,810
tree and they are collecting all of the

00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:47,780
B SMS that the cars are transmitting

00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:49,640
there are three thousand ish vehicles in

00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:52,430
Ann Arbor that have volunteered to be

00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,350
part of this pilot project so that these

00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:57,740
vehicles as they are driving around an

00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:59,570
arbor are transmitting these B SMS basic

00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:01,970
safety messages and we're collecting

00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:03,730
them so what we are doing is that we're

00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:07,460
collecting various statistics regarding

00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:09,470
how effective are these car radio

00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:14,110
transmitters and where they are located

00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:18,380
and in this particular case this is

00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:21,200
which screen is this oh this is the

00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:22,880
overlap so if you have two RS use

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,930
because we're talking about broadcast

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:28,730
radio information everybody's getting

00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:32,120
the same message so when a car

00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:36,130
broadcasts multiple RS us may receive

00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:39,830
that message and so we want to find out

00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:43,580
where the overlap is and then what we do

00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:45,350
is we paint some we have some graphical

00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:49,460
work showing what's the effective range

00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:51,170
of each RSU at what distance for a RS

00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:54,040
you are we able to get to the

00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:58,430
transmission I'm going to wrap this up

00:27:54,040 --> 00:28:00,290
with first of all a thanks to the US

00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:02,120
Department of Transportation intelligent

00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:04,190
transportation systems joint program

00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:06,080
office they have a wonderful website

00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:07,210
there's all the information that you

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,410
would ever want to know about

00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:11,900
intelligent transportation systems

00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:14,660
there's a lot of material there lots of

00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:17,210
good stuff there but just as importantly

00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:19,490
I want to throw a shout out to the other

00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:21,920
open source projects and a couple non

00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:23,750
open source projects that make all of

00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:26,260
this possible we're certainly not

00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:29,900
writing all of this code on on our own

00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:32,090
it is built on the shoulders of a lot of

00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:34,760
people who through their efforts have

00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:37,160
contributed contributed all of these

00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:40,559
fundamentals that we have built this

00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:42,419
stuff upon if anybody is interested in

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:45,600
more details about this we'd like to

00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:47,249
talk about this and anymore most of you

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,169
have already known that you can find me

00:28:47,249 --> 00:28:50,940
generally at the registration desk every

00:28:49,169 --> 00:28:53,519
morning more than happy to talk to you

00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,259
about it and if you live in the

00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:57,210
Baltimore area or we'd like to live in

00:28:55,259 --> 00:28:59,340
the Baltimore area and be involved in

00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:02,440
projects like this I would really like

00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:10,299
to talk to you thank you very much

00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:10,299
