[Music]

00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:23,550
good morning everyone

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:26,430
I think you all for having me I'm very

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,789
excited to be here I like to think

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,859
myself is a bit organized so like end of

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:34,469
November the same but I'll be planning

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:37,680
what I'll be doing for the early half of

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:41,570
the next year and then I live out the

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,450
rest of the the second half of the to

00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:47,940
execute any results of the first half so

00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:50,969
my initial plan for this year didn't

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:55,020
have the u.s. coming here for Django

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:57,360
Kanye's in my plan I thought oh well we

00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,920
have our issues in Zimbabwe but I think

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,899
the US they've got their own the

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,290
shootings the fires and stuff like that

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,150
and it will grab holding for my family

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,360
to lose me while attending a conference

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:12,330
so the list of conference that I plan to

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,430
attend was Pike on Namibia obviously I

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:18,000
was organizing django con Europe so

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,869
there was obvious and then Pike when I

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,360
thought I would be organized and

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,400
forgotten about again this year by then

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,170
the events in Zimbabwe discouraged me

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,820
and I thought I couldn't take the

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,470
emotional burden of organising a

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,500
conference in a turbulent environment so

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:35,280
I dropped that one so when I was asked

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,470
to kill not whilst I was in a jungle con

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,299
Europe I forgot that I had said I

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,850
wouldn't be attending Django Cornelius

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,460
for obvious reasons and I accepted and

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,810
also didn't do research for how long it

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,450
would take me to get yet because I'd

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,549
also thought out at MJ coka nostra Lea

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,840
but then I saw it was it would take me

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,030
too long and the visa process the

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,060
protected forest Bob way so I dropped

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,610
that one and then when I actually got on

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,140
the plane after I checked G that's when

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,659
I went out how long you to take me in I

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,520
found that it was 36 hours good thing is

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,939
I win again it's Russell for the longest

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,939
strip

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:15,430
but each was so tiring and I realized

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,350
that I hadn't quite learned from my

00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,090
first bike economy bikes experience

00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:21,010
which I'd shot about 33 hours by Road to

00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,810
go to work on amoeba I thought I had

00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,239
lent my name is taken improved but

00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,550
assumes I still get excited and make

00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:30,010
this these decisions but all the same I

00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:32,200
excited I'm excited to be here and I'd

00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:35,020
like to think organizing for organizers

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,360
for inviting me I think if they did and

00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,890
invited me I think I'd even myself I

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,590
think three years without coming to the

00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:43,600
u.s. so I'm actually excited to be and

00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,360
I'm thankful that they okay they invited

00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,340
me and thank you Jeff not for paying my

00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,830
course to be here I'm so excited to be a

00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:54,610
very well now some time and I hope you

00:02:50,830 --> 00:03:01,360
will enjoy my talk so I'll be talking

00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:03,310

currently the fundraising coordinator

00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,750
for jungle girls foundation so I took

00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:13,180
this ask me page if you want to ask me

00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,250
about Jang bogos foundation I'm here to

00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:18,670
talk if you also want to ask me about my

00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:20,799
corn Zimbabwe Python in Africa and other

00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:24,250
events that are organized taking place

00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:27,269
in Africa you can ask me don't ask me

00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:30,100
about Santiago I'm new to the year so I

00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:32,410
won't be able to of you with that then

00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:36,040
I'm also currently in the jungle so free

00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:37,750
foundation but it's something that I

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,720
tried to do just to run for the election

00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,480
I didn't think I would make it to the

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,090
board so I just tried to put myself for

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,489
myself at least get on foot so thank you

00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:52,350
for watching for me today just 1/2 word

00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:54,940
I didn't expect it so thank you so

00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:58,870
what'll I be talking about I'll share

00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:00,940
with you my coding Jenny how I started

00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:02,049
and also answered the question why I

00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,790
chose Python

00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:06,220
despite the fact that it was in so

00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:08,950
popular in Zimbabwe and then I'll share

00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,290
my thoughts on what I think mentorship

00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:17,290
is through a port project that I've went

00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:20,530
on so my break ground who am I so I had

00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,639
born in a family of four we are two boys

00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,409
two girls

00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:26,530
I'm the youngest girl I have a little

00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:28,539
brother was currently in Sweden so he's

00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,900
taking up after me of being a

00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:34,210
Globetrotter so I'm very proud of you

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,639
so I grew up in the rural areas my

00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,770
father is now eight master history does

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,509
is a teacher my mother is a teacher but

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,159
my father I chose to work in the rural

00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:45,879
areas because he thought life was cheap

00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:47,560
a day so because it's schools in

00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:50,409
Zimbabwe Monroe is there to provide

00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,210
housing for teachers and they only have

00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:53,770
to pay like cost for electricity and

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,930
water so he thought it was the cheaper

00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,699
route the advantage to that was it gives

00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:01,090
me like sort of a high self-esteem

00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:02,349
because we were the privileged kids at

00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,849
school because you are learning from

00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:06,039
with children who are coming from the

00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:08,770
rural areas some of them will come like

00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:10,810
barefoot some of them don't have proper

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:14,319
uniforms or jaysus and we had all this

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:16,419
was like so my first six years of school

00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,620
I thought I was the privileged kid you

00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:19,990
know am i the other kids

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,969
then I became a boarder in grade 7 and

00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,189
that changed because now I was mixing

00:05:21,969 --> 00:05:25,990
with children who it our parents were

00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:28,060
lawyers and I didn't know all those

00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:31,360
professions you know the rural areas you

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:34,419
know teachers Nessie's agricultural

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,060
officers you know business owners who

00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:38,440
owned shops and then you see bus drivers

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,629
and conductors when you go to challenge

00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,969
it over the holiday so it was quite a

00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:47,050
bit of a surprise for me are changing

00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:49,060
and when I went to high school my father

00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:51,129
decided because he had taught at samoto

00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,479
High School that every one of his

00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:55,120
children would code they it wasn't

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,430
really my choice but I hate to go there

00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,400
because it was my father's decision and

00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:02,680
this is my first week in high school for

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,680
a long time this was my worst photo a

00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,779
heritage because when we when we took it

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,000
I thought I was you know posing and then

00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:15,490
when it came out it didn't really look

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,939
nice you see so I it is funny when I was

00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:21,039
ready for my job you know looking back

00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:26,529
there was 1999 in I was 12 years old

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:28,539
and ya know it's really funny so this

00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:30,789
was my first time in high school and

00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:32,949
what happens in the suburban education

00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:35,320
system is the final results of the

00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:37,330
previous Oh LaVon LFO they come out in

00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,460
in February so that was the first time

00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,680
that actually knew that Daisy

00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:45,010
they are computerized was our schools

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,840
offering Computer Studies for Oliver in

00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:49,240
computing for Oliver and the reason why

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,030
I knew about these subjects was it was

00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,370
the first time they of school had

00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:56,590
searched for this examination and there

00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:59,380
was the subjects we are really dismally

00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,910
failed but at least that got me the

00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,470
attention of knowing that there are such

00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:04,180
a thing as the computers because the

00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:07,060
only thing that we had at home was a

00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:10,140
television so I thought you know

00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:13,480
inspired my interest in computers and

00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:15,550
the next year I met with to inform to

00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,530
the subject would be a I would be

00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:20,440
offered when I was in firm 3 that was

00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:23,020
2008 and then there was this there was

00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,250
this boy was in another class so here I

00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,470
watched he was

00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:30,010
besides being geek and Neddy he was also

00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:31,960
be a good at being our showing off so he

00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:35,770
had some brochures from Staffordshire

00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:39,040
University School of Computing and it's

00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:41,350
it's 88 programs that were offered there

00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,970
and if you studied computer science you

00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:45,190
could do suffer engineering you could do

00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:46,480
network engineering and other things

00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,910
I've been engineering that really

00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,440
inspired me to and I thought out

00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,750
interested like in software engineering

00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,870
and I was as I was preparing my joke I

00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:59,290
realized okay so actually of my career

00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:00,820
decision true to this boy you showed me

00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:07,660
this process you know in trying to show

00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:09,940
off so what was the first happen is

00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:11,500
enough form to we're supposed to be

00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,510
selected depending on where you are if

00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,640
you are strong in mathematics and

00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:18,160
scientists you are graded in to be in

00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,320
the science classes and then if you are

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,360
not you'd go to the add classes so I was

00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,580
within a mathematic inside so I thought

00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,910
I was an automatic feature for taking

00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:29,650
computer science but then things kind of

00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:32,020
like always changed we need to get to my

00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,640
stream so instead of having two classes

00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:36,010
three computer studies they decided to

00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,469
say okay students I don't drink so we

00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:41,650
have one client class twists Computer

00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:44,169
Studies in another one to account and it

00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:46,570
turns out the EB shell instead of June

00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:49,010
why they used to do this math mixed maps

00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:51,170
go to three East for

00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:53,060
studies and then the other marks they go

00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:55,250
to three ways they said it just to have

00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,200
a balance it's just you know too random

00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:00,620
so I found myself being placed in three

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,110
ways to do accounts I didn't like rounds

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,790
though I've never done it but it was I

00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,260
had already set my mind on doing a

00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,360
computer study I saw a girl do software

00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:12,410
engineering so I went and asked the

00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:14,000
teacher get done but what kept criteria

00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:16,370
did you use to put me in the accounts

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,070
class so he couldn't answer that so he

00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:21,170
had to redo the classes again and push

00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:23,330
me in three is so I could do computer

00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,920
studies and those who wanted to opt out

00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:31,070
into accounts they were given that

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:32,930
choice so I ended up doing computer

00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:38,990
studies at from three so that's when I

00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:41,990
started actually learning to code and my

00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:44,510
coding Jenny began so I started learning

00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:48,920
computer coding when I was in from three

00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:51,650
and ways to using we had windows 95

00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,360
machines those are the ones that we had

00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:55,550
at our school there was the ones used by

00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:00,440
the juniors from 3 and 4 and then the

00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:02,420
windows 98 in the Windows 2000 would be

00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,780
used by the a life of students you know

00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:08,330
so I still remember you know my

00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:09,950
excitement when I poured up the computer

00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:12,230
for the first time I'm sure that this

00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:14,330
that Windows 95 13 you know with the

00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:17,080
black and white screen you know it was

00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:20,480
very exciting and we recording with

00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:22,040
basic and DBAs 3 and people sometimes

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,080
wonder why there's to use you know

00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,270
windows but you know it was my first

00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:29,600
class that's that's what I see you know

00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:32,120
experience first at the computer so yeah

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:36,020
I learnt earlier for we learned first

00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,100
car and we learnt visual basic now for

00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,620
our projects but we're teaching

00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,650
ourselves and I really realized that I

00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:47,090
really wanted to do you know programming

00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:49,270
then I went to to college the first

00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:51,410
language that we learned there was

00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:53,990
introduction to programming we do we did

00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,670
with C and I laughed so much and our

00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:59,000
lecturer was very good

00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:01,520
I really enjoyed C we are also doing

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,840
systems analysis in design I'd already

00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,880
done two projects

00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,190
school so I didn't advantage over others

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:11,660
I really enjoyed the subjects then when

00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:13,840
we were in in second year things started

00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:16,430
going bad in Zimbabwe so the experienced

00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,290
professionals they left and so what will

00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:20,030
happen while I was somebody graduates

00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:22,340
like this semester and then the next

00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:25,100
semester you'll be teaching you so when

00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,500
I was in second my second year we are

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,670
supposed to be doing this your basic

00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,790
object oriented to programming is visual

00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:34,300
basic and oh if you have got a big

00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:37,490
lecture programming kit actually such

00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:39,740
are here like so but I realized okay

00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:41,150
what we were learning in class was a

00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,190
little bit shallow than what I already

00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,480
knew about the language so I saw and

00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,770
myself if I'm going to be a software

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,540
engineer and I'm going to do a Kim

00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:49,370
Zimbabwe this profession is actually

00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,080
going to you know such I'll be doing the

00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,790
same things over and over again I don't

00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,560
have many people to look up to and I'll

00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:56,900
be just copying and pasting my code and

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,350
when we were growing up also we didn't

00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:02,450
have access to the Internet like we were

00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:05,090
we were over a thousand universities

00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,470
University students and with less than

00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:08,390
hundred computers that were in the our

00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:10,220
connected to the Internet so I only

00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:12,860
actually goes to enjoy the internet when

00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,900
I went for my work-related learning in

00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:17,810
third year but I had already decided

00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,730
that I was going to not going to into a

00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:22,430
software development film rather I'll

00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:24,590
chose to go into telecoms I do

00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:26,450
networking I do support and then

00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,830
everything else about ihe then if later

00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,540
on in life I decided to become a

00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,010
programmer I was just start learning

00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,080
programming again because I realized

00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,910
okay it doesn't really make sense to be

00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,560
copying and pasting code again because

00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:38,750
you don't have the books you don't have

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,520
the internet and also a lecture is not

00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:46,100
that good so that really explains why

00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:47,630
later I become a career nomad so if you

00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,180
check my LinkedIn profile or what I'm

00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:52,430
going to tell you is I one person who

00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:54,650
has got so many roles which are

00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:57,080
different so after I graduated my first

00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:59,060
show us is a network technician and any

00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,940
Internet service provider and I did

00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:03,800
sysadmin support and stuff like that my

00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,960
second row I was senior IT technician

00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,810
this time which was in a university I

00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:11,210
did some systems analysis project

00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:13,670
management systems are doing and IT

00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:15,080
support I moved from there

00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:17,690
I went to

00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:20,080
and you notice at actions provider I was

00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:22,070
a nature commercial center technician

00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:26,420
supporting the network infrastructure

00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:28,399
then Japan that I only moved like for

00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:32,000
three months after three months the

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:34,269
commands to studied not playing salaries

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,950
I don't know what was happening

00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:38,690
sometimes you get I was supposed to be

00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:40,820
heavenly ending double what I was

00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:43,940
earning in my previous job so I only got

00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:47,660
three salaries in full then the other

00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:49,579
sometimes you get 200 sometimes gets

00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,860
hundreds sometimes I don't know how much

00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:54,440
do they owe me because they come on it

00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:56,300
let's shut down so it was difficult to

00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,329
check how much they are owing you so I

00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:02,959
because of this people were living the

00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:05,240
company and there was a shortage in the

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:08,060
billing department so I always stayed

00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,860
longer because I got an opening to work

00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:13,250
in the billing department is a billing

00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:16,010
analyst so they said a little bit of

00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,550
coding I I will do some SQL and stuff

00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:19,700
like that

00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:21,980
because I wanted to III just enjoyed

00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:25,579
exploring you know the IT industry so I

00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:28,130
just I was working in this department my

00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:30,529
boss got in a feud for a consultants

00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:32,930
position which required somebody at

00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:34,700
understanding of the peeling and in the

00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:36,290
telecoms industry but they couldn't

00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:41,110
quite agree on the money side of things

00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:41,110
so the people who interviewed them then

00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:47,000
looked me up through LinkedIn and like

00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:48,020
on Monday afternoon I only saw them

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,570
missing the next funny

00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,730
then they III responded they called me

00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:55,220
like on Wednesday and then by Thursday

00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:57,290
I'd got a new job and I was supposed to

00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,420
start it was at the end of the month but

00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,829
they was in he so early days so I was

00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,050
supposed to sit on the faithful ooh I go

00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:05,720
let us sell it on the 2nd of April this

00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:09,320
time I had another position again I was

00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:12,560
senior vs s + OS consultant just

00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:15,019
business support systems 800 operations

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,220
I was a systems consultant so they took

00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:18,860
me to Mozambique which was the

00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:21,769
consultants project for a convention

00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:24,829
billing and CRM project it was fun being

00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:28,250
an expert going shopping to South Africa

00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:28,940
you know flying all of way home it was

00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:34,310
really fun but

00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:37,490
long hours and what I benefited most

00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:39,050
from dis roars I realized then they kept

00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:41,870
that we didn't have his Africa in terms

00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:44,300
of data signs because we we were coming

00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:47,390
from Zimbabwe as consultants on a doing

00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:49,820
project management mainly but the

00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:53,150
developer was from China and they spoke

00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:55,310
a Chinese takeout coke back our client

00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:58,130
was Mumbai was Muslim became they spoke

00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:00,580
Portuguese so I don't know if the

00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:03,260
language barrier made it difficult for

00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:05,900
for the Chinese to understand what we

00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,730
really wanted for our client but what

00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,860
we're getting was not what we wanted so

00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:12,470
I thought if I were a developer probably

00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:14,120
maybe I could give big value to my own

00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,430
community if I could have this skills

00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,350
instead of being a consumer so I

00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:22,490
actually thought of learning programming

00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:24,560
then but my workload was too busy I

00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:26,420
couldn't do that I was also getting paid

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,130
well so I didn't have things and its

00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,350
really so it was something that you know

00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:33,230
I need to do something that I can do

00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:36,320
their assignments so it was just a

00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:39,350
thought so

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,540
I didn't stay much with root beer with

00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:45,410
this company it was like for one year

00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:47,780
then I I stopped to do my Master's which

00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:52,190
is 2012 completed in storage management

00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:55,250
then afterwards I had this person so

00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:59,000
what's wrong I apply now what do I apply

00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:02,840
for now because remember I already have

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,089
six positions as it is and they're all

00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:09,730
different

00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:12,260
so I got tired of tailor making my CV

00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:14,870
systems that we have to tell I make a CV

00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,339
if it's a consulting if you have to

00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:18,230
change your CV again if it's worth

00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:20,000
developing if to change your CV again so

00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:23,209
I got tired of that and widest I was

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,670
struggling with that decision I met

00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:28,730
another old friend Wade were together

00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:30,590
that internet service provider and he

00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:34,310
had joined a scholarship I'm using a hub

00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:35,870
Chulainn he was doing Android so he

00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:38,480
advised me you could you can get on this

00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:39,770
program so the scholarship was they give

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,500
you a scholarship for six months you

00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:44,630
learn programming you do a project and

00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,760
they hope we get a job and they get 10%

00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,500
of your earnings so for somebody like me

00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,260
we has learned programming that was not

00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,760
practical so I thought okay I cannot get

00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:55,100
myself into this contract it doesn't

00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,740
make sense then I thought okay I want to

00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:01,910
then fragra me I'm currently unemployed

00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:04,480
I don't know what to apply for okay what

00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:07,370
do I have to lose so I applied anyway so

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:12,260
I went through the courses that they had

00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:15,860
and I saw that they had Python so I did

00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:18,410
you all be surprised but information

00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:20,360
stuff was slow to some certain parts of

00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:23,000
the world like Africa and Zimbabwe I

00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,980
didn't know Python existed and to 2015

00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,190
when I visited was in the hub website I

00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:31,220
don't know why I never came across -

00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:34,220
honestly in all my years in the IT

00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:37,310
industry I had to look it up and to see

00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,690
how you can use Python and I realized

00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:41,060
that one of the things ways you can

00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:44,240
inspire to an his data science so that's

00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:47,240
why I chose Python to learn the language

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:51,080
and I did I

00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,970
so that was 2015 and by 2015 October we

00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:57,440
had finished it's fighter what do you do

00:18:52,970 --> 00:19:01,910
then now we started organizing I gave

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:05,360
myself a new role now I was ITIC -

00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:06,830
consultant and Python developer okay

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,720
first a Python developer who do you see

00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:12,080
today but anyway that was my new role

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,540
which I gave myself because I shut up

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:18,920
which is not doing so well so I get a

00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:21,920
new row okay so it was really difficult

00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:24,260
getting studied out zubaba Python was

00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:28,310
not really known it's just really been a

00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:29,900
PHP country before so to get the

00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:31,760
publicity that we needed oh and also to

00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:34,900
keep myself busy we started organizing

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:39,140
events our with Humphrey

00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:41,420
so that you know you you keep learning

00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:43,610
and also you have something that you are

00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:45,860
doing in between projects so that's how

00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:47,810
I started organizing events in

00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:52,250
volunteering in the open-source

00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:54,440
community and then last year I got a new

00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:56,039
title again which is fundraising

00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,620
coordinator

00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:02,940
with jungle girls it has a little bit of

00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:06,809
coding but most of most of it is

00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:09,570
communication and emails so I've been

00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:11,429
working with Python since 2015 and I'm

00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:13,139
just going to share with you what I have

00:20:11,429 --> 00:20:15,690
gone through while I was working with

00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:17,730
Python ok and I'm going to talk about a

00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,259
project and before I talk about this

00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:24,259
project I have to give you a disclaimer

00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:27,389
that this is not my best project and

00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:27,950
it's still incomplete it's making

00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:30,119
progress

00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:33,090
but the reason why I'm talking about

00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:36,119
this project is it's one one projects

00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:38,970
that yes yet in fact in my life in terms

00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:41,940
of how much I have learnt as well as

00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:44,789
developing my coding skills as well as

00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,679
my you know my suit my soft skills with

00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:50,429
the spell to Cody I I had never worked

00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:52,470
in a in according team and I've learned

00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:56,610
a lot by working with so many people on

00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:59,549
this project so I will share so the

00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:00,360
solution that is currently on this is

00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:03,230
apropos

00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:05,940
is is not complete and it's wrong

00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:08,940
according to the people who gave me this

00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:10,710
challenge so please if you are going to

00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:15,960
look at it maybe you just give me some

00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:18,059
feedback but don't expect much so the

00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,029
quick a decided this was part of a

00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:24,990
technical interview question it's very

00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:26,460
low so I just put up that statement I

00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:29,369
was supposed to build a single page up

00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:31,950
with a full view put a view port map on

00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:33,690
top and a list of addresses below and it

00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:35,970
was supposed to be based on jumbo 1.9

00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:39,080
when I was given it and the use case was

00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:41,700
if I click in any location on the map

00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,740
validate that this is our u address and

00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,350
it's not some wood Mountain or say I

00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:49,759
need to see then if it's valid but save

00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:54,929
it a simple database table and what what

00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:56,970
okay it's very long the question but the

00:21:54,929 --> 00:21:57,629
major challenges with a first with this

00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:01,289
project

00:21:57,629 --> 00:22:04,409
ok so the one thing we don't use Google

00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:05,960
Maps that much in Zimbabwe the only term

00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:09,280
that I use cooking up Safari it's a

00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:11,860
client website and I just want to

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,560
show a pointer of where they are located

00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:18,160
on a contact page that's what we do

00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:20,170
basically but the challenge is Google

00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:23,260
Maps is not so accurate in Zimbabwe

00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:25,840
based because whatever 7 is users are

00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:27,610
supposed to put their own addresses

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,680
right people don't do that

00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:33,520
and what they do is suppose therefore

00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:36,030
their own company located maybe on the

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,380
corner corner Samora Machel faith Street

00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:40,570
instead of putting the pointer right at

00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,860
the corner of the street they want the

00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:44,320
users to know that the entrance is

00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:48,100
actually not at the corner but maybe

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,720
some 50 50 or 20 meters so the point

00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:53,560
that will not be necessary at the corner

00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:55,960
but would you be like away from the

00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,370
corner so in when you know maps and

00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,170
skill you know that that's the wrong

00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:01,180
address and somebody who actually come

00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:03,520
in who's another address on the opposite

00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:05,200
side so I've got lost in a couple of

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,660
times in Zimbabwe are using Google Maps

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,340
and I know of somebody who used GPS in

00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,960
Zimbabwe and got lost in a very small

00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,700
simple so you're actually better off

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:17,200
asking people than using Google Wave

00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:18,580
since Bob so because of that it becomes

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,920
difficult for each is a appreciate with

00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:23,830
something that you don't really use then

00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,660
the other thing is I'd never really had

00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:27,580
of Google Fusion Tables in my life okay

00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:29,380
if I don't use Google Maps the Chinese

00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:32,410
are high I don't know what Google Fusion

00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:36,220
Tables are so I had a lot of learning to

00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:39,100
do with respect today to the project so

00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:41,320
my initial attempt I tried to use

00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:44,980
angular I had done it to do up with it

00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,800
angularjs and Django rest framework and

00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:50,650
John 1:29

00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:52,900
but I couldn't decide update and

00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:55,420
couldn't work with me because I when you

00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:58,570
look at Google Maps to us they use raw

00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:01,360
JavaScript and I couldn't get angularjs

00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:04,810
ed funded JavaScript awake so I saw

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:08,350
something again okay when I submitted it

00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:10,720
I was thought okay you didn't do any

00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:12,160
testing you didn't do any validation and

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,650
you didn't do any documentation

00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:17,679
I only submitted it not because I

00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:20,230
thought it was okay but does the in a

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,820
few hours were okay was asking me and

00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,520
it's been it had been a long time since

00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:26,200
I submitted

00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:29,240
so I guess I've cheated anyway so I

00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:33,820
decided to take some time for personal

00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:36,230
development and I started to let Angela

00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:38,420
online I realized there's no point to

00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:39,950
stick me sticking with angularjs I'm not

00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,990
good at it anyway I started learning

00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:44,930
angular then I also did a workshop

00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,820
tutorial on jumbo England young girls

00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:49,280
from like each bike on Namibia it was

00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:53,630
just a way of trying to to learn or now

00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:55,970
to do this then I tried to do the

00:24:53,630 --> 00:25:01,870
project again this time I

00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:03,080
well III look good and realize that it's

00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:06,230
difficult

00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:09,650
not maps with ng map so I tried that so

00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:11,840
I could render the map but now I could

00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:14,090
not do everything else that I was

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,580
supposed to do I could just generally I

00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:20,690
mean I had a back-end that was working

00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:22,580
but post requests couldn't go through I

00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:24,410
just know I could click but I could

00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:28,880
geography reverse geocoding this I

00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:31,070
wanted so okay I changed that I was just

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,440
making one this one my own I tried now

00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:35,720
to do angular jungles for making Jango

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,030
and then I just use JavaScript to load

00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,520
the map and I still struggled with

00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:42,950
angular postings requests you see those

00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:46,090
promises and observables and stuff like

00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:51,170
that combine that with reverse geocoding

00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:56,360
it was bad after bad so I realized okay

00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:59,660
I think I need to ask for you so I went

00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:01,430
on Twitter and as for somebody to tell

00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:04,760
me how I could do angular post in they

00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:08,540
pointed me to another resource I could

00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:11,330
use online I also when I went to Pike or

00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:13,010
Namibia I was here a place if I was

00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:15,440
there and he was doing a workshop on

00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:17,240
testing and I also got a chance to talk

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,650
to him and I asked him advice on what I

00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,780
could do with my testing you know and

00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:23,060
other stuff and he recommended me some

00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:26,560
books which I could get to help with

00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:30,320
coding industries then I also approached

00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:34,850
much coming in I remember I had done a

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:36,380
choke on jumbo validation so I asked him

00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:38,660
about basically develop

00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,679
Django invalidation and he gave me some

00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:44,210
with chips

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:46,429
I asked also Daniele is one of the board

00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:49,000
members but he has also been involved in

00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:51,500
Python events in Africa for your

00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,320
documentation in Django con Europe so

00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:57,110
I've really have been using a contacts

00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:00,320
whom I met at conferences really get

00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:02,330
help I also asked mi-jung go con Europe

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:06,309
but she had a workshop with the jungle

00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:08,690
is from ik on how to integrate jungle

00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:13,010
django in jungles from make to any other

00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:14,570
frontage technology then I also asked my

00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:17,510
boss is Ola and Ola

00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:21,020
Maka's and Norma co-organizers of jungle

00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:24,919
con Europe on Django in a jigs and then

00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:27,080
I needed books to read and thanks to

00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:28,820
Java corner oh I made a good friend way

00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,740
of me with my shorty you did the

00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:32,330
shopping before I got there and then I

00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:36,020
just collected in a Gucci jungle con

00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:39,500
Europe and so after getting the

00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:43,640
resources ahead is the book in the

00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:45,559
picture there on its ok doesn't do it

00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,000
doesn't talk about the coding itself but

00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:48,590
just helps you with your soft skills on

00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,840
how to approach project design and stuff

00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:53,390
like that so I did it design and decided

00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,669
to use ok I think I'm going to replace

00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:57,620
Angela with Ajax that way I still used

00:27:55,669 --> 00:28:00,679
to get used to use JavaScript without

00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:04,000
problems and then I decide to get a

00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:07,030
mentor there are two helped me with a

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,049
Jake's so I should I add chick Jeff as

00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:12,620
jungle is from week and realized that

00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:15,970
Tom Christopher uses Ajax also so I

00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:18,710
approached him for each feature and we

00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:20,530
talked a lot out send you my code

00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:23,150
snippets and you would comment on them

00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:26,210
give me advice on what to do I sent him

00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:28,159
again I said another person snippet and

00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:31,820
you know just pictures and he comments

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:34,580
on them and we had a lots of those and I

00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:36,169
managed to do a put first solution so I

00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:38,090
would look there map and you reversed

00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:40,760
your coaching with JavaScript and then

00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:42,830
sifted the results to data merge the

00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,549
database I wanted to themself to Google

00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:45,799
Fusion Tables

00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:47,299
but as mm man I should do this but this

00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:49,999
was the beautiful solution that I was

00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:52,379
supposed to do and then

00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:55,049
JavaScript and Ajax would be used to

00:28:52,379 --> 00:28:56,730
communicate to for the front-end

00:28:55,049 --> 00:29:02,220
communicate with the bacon and then

00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:04,559
jungle frames make to link the true so

00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:07,830
working with Ajax I was very new to Ajax

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:09,570
and check really so many treated GM's

00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:13,679
really between me and Tom really helped

00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:15,690
me to get started the testing I had a

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,090
book that I had been given by Harry

00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:20,039
Percival its back on Namibia and this

00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:25,460
helped me with functional chess and unit

00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:28,350
tests and then validation my hour with

00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:30,600
much tourmaline came into place I

00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:32,759
managed to land my first custom

00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:37,109
validator you know and it really worked

00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:41,730
and I was proud proud of that it wasn't

00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:43,499
quite what the interviewer wanted in

00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:47,970
there for documentation when I asked

00:29:43,499 --> 00:29:49,320
Daniela he just gave me yeah he gave us

00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:50,940
a project finish and he just was

00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,639
something in my not focused so if that's

00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:55,769
what we did it said you only need like

00:29:53,639 --> 00:29:58,019
four sections tutorial exploration in

00:29:55,769 --> 00:30:01,320
how to guide and reference and because

00:29:58,019 --> 00:30:02,970
of this small you know I think it's led

00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:05,190
took less than 10 minutes I was able to

00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:08,669
do the best documentation for a project

00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:11,070
I've ever done in my life the only

00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:13,289
problem was is that the project was

00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:14,970
incomplete so they documentation could

00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:19,590
it be really as complete as it should be

00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:24,359
so I did a project with HS for readme

00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:30,450
and I was really proud of myself for is

00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:33,059
done then I submitted the solution now

00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:35,700
not because I wanted to submit it but

00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:38,879
apparently the person had been following

00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,679
my github and you know seeing what I was

00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:42,450
doing so he said that I was working on

00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:43,919
something I didn't want to submit it but

00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:48,059
because you have been asked you you know

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:51,749
you just submit so the feedback was I

00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:53,309
had good documentation and chess though

00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:54,299
they were incomplete obviously because

00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:57,450
the project was incomplete

00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:58,859
my first you're purging had been done in

00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:02,279
the front head the front-end was

00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:03,660
supposed to be done hit backend and then

00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:06,060
I was doing the wrong

00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:08,880
researching at the page with a get

00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:11,910
request was wrong and he recommended

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,340
some written resources and he said my

00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:15,210
validation was rich enough then he asked

00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:18,600
me a question

00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:20,520
what's my career plan and recommended

00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,830
that training a small team would be I do

00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:25,860
for me to learn in the old one they

00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:28,530
become a great developer so the fit

00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:31,890
became in a very long email and when it

00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:34,050
came it was shortly after our elections

00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:36,150
and they had been shootings and whatnot

00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:38,310
Watchmen so I had a lot of things on my

00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:42,510
mind so I took like three months before

00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:46,160
I responded to this I okay I didn't even

00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:50,210
have time to detail yeah the email and

00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:52,740
so after three months I responded I

00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:54,510
really didn't get your feedback okay I

00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:57,090
understood the comments that they give

00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:58,470
me but I didn't actually understood the

00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:00,600
questions they asked me I wash my

00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:03,600
carrier and I thought I told him that

00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:09,120
okay I can't learn development but maybe

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:10,740
later I want to do data science so I

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,050
realized that I was actually clear on

00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:15,150
what I wanted to do now I had very clear

00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:21,390
maybe all along but now I don't what I

00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:23,760
know what I want to do so I had to ask

00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:25,170
myself a question so what's my ultimate

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,440
career plan

00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:30,090
alright because I already have a long CV

00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:34,440
I don't know I don't know what I really

00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:35,700
want to do so then I left there is this

00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,590
thing called such like bridge

00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,480
engineering where they take people who

00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:43,800
have got a good line axe background and

00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:46,290
systems admin wrong and who can code so

00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:48,600
I realized okay so I think I've been

00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:50,640
going this the wrong way I already I

00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,710
already have a lot of skills that I

00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,060
useful that I should not shine our way

00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:56,190
and try to become a full-stack developer

00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:57,750
now but what I could do is I could just

00:32:56,190 --> 00:33:00,150
add my coding school to discuss that I

00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:02,640
already have and I could be more

00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:04,320
successful so here is now my new goal

00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,860
and I hope this is going to be my last

00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,690
title

00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:09,270
and that's what I'm working to us now

00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:09,600
and I'm very serious about this I mean

00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:14,670
it

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:17,320
okay so Achilles tends to draw from

00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:20,200
right Jaime

00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:23,169
what can you learn so if this is your

00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:26,169
first conference or you just have been

00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:29,620
learning out programming one thing that

00:33:26,169 --> 00:33:32,649
helped me was attending meetups and

00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:34,630
conferences and also Sprint's it's

00:33:32,649 --> 00:33:36,639
helped me meet my potential Mentors

00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:38,080
it also helped me I learned from the

00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:40,210
various talks that I would attend at

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,639
those conferences it also helped me meet

00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:46,750
friends we've been helpful in many ways

00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:48,519
in making my journey successful and one

00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:50,259
thing that I have learned also is asking

00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:53,100
for help is very crucial

00:33:50,259 --> 00:33:54,850
I think if I had asked for help in mine

00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:57,610
in my career

00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:59,320
Elya on you know learning Python instead

00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:01,720
of trying to do it on my own I could

00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:03,639
have learned more than all this yes

00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,559
instead of just trying to do it myself

00:34:03,639 --> 00:34:07,000
so you actually learn more when you

00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:07,779
approach other people and ask them to

00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,839
help you out

00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:12,579
they really don't have to okay there the

00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:14,109
programmers are very busy therefore they

00:34:12,579 --> 00:34:16,510
are busy schedules and then don't have

00:34:14,109 --> 00:34:17,950
to write long lines of code for you they

00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:19,929
just like to suggest something for you

00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:21,369
to do and you if you know what you are

00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:23,500
supposed to be surfing for on the

00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:25,089
Internet is easier than ready don't know

00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,169
what you're supposed to do next so this

00:34:25,089 --> 00:34:30,609
one thing that I took from my journey

00:34:28,169 --> 00:34:32,109
trying to learn on my own being soft

00:34:30,609 --> 00:34:36,450
short without other people to rely on

00:34:32,109 --> 00:34:39,700
and conferences really emerged as my

00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:42,280
source of a large pool of mentors who

00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:45,129
helped me with small things that I need

00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,079
to learn and if you are a beginner you

00:34:45,129 --> 00:34:48,609
could learn more if you can just talk to

00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:52,030
people over lunch

00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:54,040
the good thing about jeonguk on us is

00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:56,109
they don't have bridge is that that's

00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,540
say I'm up for a chat or I do and if I'm

00:34:56,109 --> 00:35:01,900
not up for a shot so you can just talk

00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:03,430
to people if they are walking around you

00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,380
will not be violating anything because

00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:10,660
they didn't say I don't want to chat

00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:13,089
with you so yeah then for advanced

00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:16,869
developers please do not dismiss a

00:35:13,089 --> 00:35:19,869
beginner if you don't know what's how to

00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:22,150
help them oh it's not your area or you

00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:27,010
don't have the time it's better to just

00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:28,750
show them or refer them to someone this

00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:30,760
has been really helpful for me like when

00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:34,090
I attend Sprint's if I

00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:36,910
something last time in Django corner

00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:39,190
abide issues with Joker and here cup was

00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:43,420
very kind to refer me to omit somebody

00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:45,250
called a toka expert and help me so

00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:49,540
that's really helpful if it's not your

00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:53,230
area suggest someone okay so yes someone

00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:56,380
to you and it will go a long way and

00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:57,880
please don't show me how my work I'll

00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:59,230
pour my code is that's why I don't go on

00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,660
Stack Overflow because I said that's

00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:03,160
what people do so I can't post a

00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:06,119
question there I know people are going

00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:09,220
to tell me how am I quote my code is and

00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:10,900
so my thoughts on membership is it

00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,460
doesn't really need you to take to

00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,650
devote an hour of your time every week

00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:16,750
every month to mentor some people just

00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:18,790
give you a few minutes to add a sample

00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:20,800
these questions so you something kind

00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:24,490
and show them how to get on with your

00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,530
code it will help them instead of just

00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:28,060
saying I'm busy and it's realize it's

00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:30,430
meetups when you meet people who are

00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:32,200
studying out there gen with God it

00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:34,720
really helps for you just to be kind to

00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:36,730
help them media code two minutes five

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,130
minutes 10 minutes talks you left one a

00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:41,020
long way in helping that person become a

00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:44,109
programmer and become better at life

00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:46,720
they also appreciate the according our

00:36:44,109 --> 00:36:48,940
industry because people are helpful so

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,180
for me I feel so blessed to have so many

00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:54,310
kind people in my life we have taken

00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:56,440
time to look at my code and also improve

00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:58,510
it and some of them have been kind you

00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:02,560

00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,780
I'll leave you with this code the key to

00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:37,540
realizing a dream is not to focus on

00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:39,070
success but significance and then even

00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:41,770

journey donor support it's been long but

00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,510
going to do the networking and the

00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,490
systems admin and then get back to

00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:02,140
coding and I feel like I've accomplished

00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:04,480
something I haven't got the job yet but

00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:06,520

00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,040
the first place so I'm really happy to

00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:11,500
