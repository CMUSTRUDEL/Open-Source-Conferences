00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:30,500
like I'm mister schwag here I've got my

00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:33,140

00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:39,940
a lot of you guys here for the free

00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,940
stuff but I'm here too

00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,659
so next week I'm going home I'm live

00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,010
here so I'm kind of on vacation all the

00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:49,399
time but next week I'm going home to

00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:52,940
Minnesota and yeah school right anybody

00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,870
who is here from Minnesota so next week

00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,420
going home

00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,100
my cousin is in stand up and I want to

00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,109
do that with him so this is my first

00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,420
kind of public speaking little practice

00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:04,009
but meanwhile I'm a programmer so I feel

00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,429
like I have some funny things to say

00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:10,009
about programming all right so I'd like

00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:11,990
to say thank Chloe and because as a

00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:16,130
programmer who's locked in a padded cell

00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:17,600
all day it's nice to laugh and and I

00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,539
think we don't laugh enough as

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,090
programmers so so here I am trying to

00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:25,880
make us laugh and and and you know my

00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:28,189
boss shoves me away in that padded cell

00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,880
says go do X Y Z a little inside joke

00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:32,479
because I do

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,759
I just did a plot an X Y Z and an I work

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,700
at Scripps Institute of Oceanography my

00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:39,259
goal you know save the oceans so so

00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,180
that's what I do on my day job and

00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:42,560
meanwhile I crack myself up all the time

00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,869
so I thought hey might as well give it a

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,240
try you know cracking some y'all so

00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:50,810
we're in the land of the hippies aka San

00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,340
Diego and we like labels so I actually

00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:55,850
don't have a button cuz I don't really

00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:58,430
care for labels but I other people's

00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,079
labels and so you know except for food

00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,479
I'm always like is this local organic

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,869
shade-grown Fairtrade you know I like my

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,149
food labels right well another thing of

00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:10,369
land or the one we are one we like to be

00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:13,640
one with each other one with nature

00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:16,130
one with ourselves let me tell you about

00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,510
what I wish we were one at a time I was

00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,150
just like there's just never enough time

00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:23,000
right and anybody program with time time

00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:25,910

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,739

00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,810
24 and I'm talking to normal people like

00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:31,850
oh oh I know a lot about time zones man

00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,590
there's more than 24 someone from our 30

00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,360
minutes or 45 minutes apart

00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:38,900
and then there's daylight savings time I

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,300
am like please can we get rid of this

00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,890
like I've been looking up on the history

00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,840
of this because I'm like this just is

00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,430
archaic this needs to go programming

00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,080
you're just like oh my god can we not

00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:52,129

UTC you know I wish that would be just

00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:56,980
be my programming life so much easier so

00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:03,799

00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:49,789
tunnel

00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:53,479
in code mode you're just gonna go going

00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:55,400
going going right meanwhile Oh Daniel I

00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:57,080
got to go to the bathroom boom that's

00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,509
when you figure something out is when

00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,580
you stepped away right you step away you

00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:03,800
realize I need to step away a little bit

00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:07,009
more often you know because we all need

00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,910
to step away anyways last thought trying

00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:09,440
to save the oceans

00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:12,020
sometimes there's labels respect those

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,610
labels including recycle labels some of

00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,530

00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,540
[Applause]

00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,960
Thanks hi everybody I'm Tim I write code

00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,340
for the Wharton School various

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,440
open-source projects and most

00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:39,110
importantly for myself I helped organize

00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,640
Django con us here and also the

00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,800
Philadelphia Python users group back

00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,570
home I started writing code when I was

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,390
six years old because my mom want a

00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:50,360
raffle and I've been doing it ever since

00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:53,150
and absolutely love it I consider myself

00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,860
very lucky to get paid to do what I love

00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,690
with colleagues and friends that are

00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:00,440
close enough to be considered like a

00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:04,730
second non-dna family so let me show you

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,110
my github chart from 2014 did that look

00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:09,890
like the chart it's somebody who likes

00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:12,260
to write code a lot the truth is in 2014

00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:13,880
I wasn't doing what I loved I had been

00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:17,650
slipping further and further away from

00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:19,970
doing what I love for a long time and

00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:22,250
you know why I still worked hard and had

00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:25,280
a lovely home squaring who I thought I

00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:27,050
was and who I should be with how I acted

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,600
what's getting harder and harder every

00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:33,620
day and looking in the mirror was

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,850
getting harder and harder every day so

00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:39,890
it was because of this that I had to

00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:43,130
change just one thing so what happened

00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:44,990
here for many many years I had been

00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:48,620
trying to change just one thing on my

00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:50,060
own and failing finally in April I asked

00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,300
for help with my alcohol addiction

00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:56,120
problem in May I got out of rehab and

00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:59,780
you can see a sudden uptick in activity

00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:06,550
there and I've been clean and sober one

00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:10,070
day at a time ever since so thank you

00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:12,410
so what happened here in July in August

00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,030
I made a terrible terrible tragic

00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:18,800
mistake and reopened my World of

00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:20,660
Warcraft account so 2016 looks like it

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,220
might be a bit of a lighter year but I

00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,980
was contributing to several private

00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,840
repositories and me and my friends from

00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,310
Wharton were also a little busy helping

00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,890
host this conference that you may have

00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:33,080
heard of the year was in Philadelphia

00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:34,640
but when we take a look at 2017 this is

00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,830
where I really started to hit my stride

00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,990
having gotten more involved with a bunch

00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:40,910
of open source projects and from Wharton

00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,930
we also started to put some of the

00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:46,820
packages we had been developing

00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:49,430
internally on github and pi PI and if

00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,500
you take a look at 2018 it's up to so

00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:54,770
the first year was 21 contributions in

00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,690
the year 1053 in the last year so as you

00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:59,000
can see now I'm pretty active again and

00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,310
doing what I love writing code with a

00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,140
community of friends old and new it's

00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:05,300
been such a wonderful way to connect and

00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:07,250
just such a better life so what I just

00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:10,280
really want to do here is ask everybody

00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:12,590
if there is one thing that you could

00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,290
change about yourself one thing that you

00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:17,120
don't like what would it be and how much

00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:18,860
better could your life look if you could

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,990
change just that one thing it doesn't

00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,420
have to be an addiction like I had it

00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,920
doesn't have to be you know only you

00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,690
will really know what it is when you

00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,520
look at the mirror at night but I want

00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,620
to encourage everybody here to you know

00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,600
if you do have that one thing that you

00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,760
want to change about yourself it is

00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,220
worth doing it is worth asking for help

00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,350
for I couldn't do it until I asked for

00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:41,690
help and I've had support not just from

00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:43,700
the rehab center I went to and not just

00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,350
the recovery communities I've been in my

00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,660
colleagues at work have been incredibly

00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,580
supportive the Django community which I

00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,590
have immersed myself in ever since has

00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,630
been incredibly supportive and it's been

00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,250
an amazing amount of support everywhere

00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:57,080
I've looked to try to keep this going

00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:59,960
one day at a time and the same thing

00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,310
could happen for you because if you need

00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,840
help to make that change you know

00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:05,180
absolutely ask for it because it really

00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,340
did save my life and you know as Gandhi

00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,050
said we must be the change we want to

00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:12,260
see in the world so if you have a

00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:14,480
problem sometimes changing one thing can

00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,970
change everything and it really did for

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,029
me thank you very much

00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,029
you

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:31,279
hello everyone I'm a software developer

00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:33,470
and I write software but occasionally I

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,720
do not only need to write software or

00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:37,279
need to write documentation or put up a

00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,250
website for the software that I've

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,350
written both things usually include

00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,389
screenshots and doing screenshots is

00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,889
cumbersome you want to do them on

00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:47,509
different screen resolutions you might

00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:50,690
want to do them with different locales

00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:52,519
and once you're all done having created

00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,589
them they are outdated and you have to

00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:57,470
start over again

00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:59,420
so let's automate this and let's

00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,790
automate it with tools that we already

00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:04,040
know or that probably most of you have

00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,509
already seen the first tool that we want

00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,839
to use is selenium you might know

00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:11,329
selenium as something to write front-end

00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:14,690
tests for your web application basically

00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:19,639
it's a way to remotely control your

00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:21,350
browser from a program the next

00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:23,000
ingredient is Chrome headless Chrome

00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:25,639
headless is a way to start chrome

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,920
without requiring a display or anything

00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:29,860
attached so you can run it on a server

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:34,339
without needing to have a full-blown

00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:37,940
desktop operating system and then we use

00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:40,279
PI test PI test is test runner but if

00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,199
you look at it closely it's not only a

00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:45,670
test runner what makes it easy to define

00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:48,440
tests and run them to run them in

00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:51,079
specific ways but basically it's a way

00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,930
to run functions in a specific way see

00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:56,810
usually you have a test that is just a

00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:59,240
Python function prefixed with test

00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:01,040
underscore and that checks for something

00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,720
and then you run PI tests and it finds

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,449
all of those functions in your project

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,970
and runs them and informs you about the

00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:10,069
result but PI tests can do so much more

00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:13,970
it can you have parameter size

00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:18,920
parameters for input and fixtures and so

00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:23,000
on fixtures for example are things that

00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:27,439
you want that should be there before the

00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,889
test is run so for example in this in

00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:34,310
this code snippet we're a testing in the

00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:36,560
SMTP library and we have a fixture that

00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:38,260
creates an SMTP connection object and

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,410
then we have a test that

00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:45,700
declares that it needs this fixed

00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:48,310
fixture passed as an input and for

00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,410
jangle there is PI test Django and in

00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:53,440
Django itself there's live server test

00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:56,800
case which allows for creating a test

00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:00,310
case that accesses an actual run server

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:03,280
like version of your app so with all

00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:04,990
these ingredients we already know them

00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,690
they're usually used for used for

00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,850
testing in this case we will use them

00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:12,520
for screen shutting and to make it a bit

00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:14,440
nicer we use pi test configuration to

00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,890
redefine some strings for example we

00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:20,370
want to define our screenshots in scene

00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:25,720
files with shot functions and not in a

00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:28,060
we don't want to call it tests and then

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,620
we can use fixtures to create objects

00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,510
because nobody is interested in

00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,520
screenshots of an empty application we

00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:37,060
want to populate the database in some

00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:39,910
way before end and we can define or as

00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:42,040
and as another feature we define the

00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:47,260
selenium client that is already locked

00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:50,050
into our system we can also define our

00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,760
screen resolution in a fixture as well

00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:55,510
as any other options that we wanna pass

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,760
to Chrome and then we can define every

00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:00,400
one of our screen shots by simply

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,280
writing something like a pie taste test

00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:06,010
with specifying what fixtures we want to

00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,350
be run before and then just calling a

00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:12,460
utility function that does a screen shot

00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:16,750
with selenium and we can run it by just

00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:19,750
calling PI tests on our folder and we're

00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:21,790
done and with PI test parameters for

00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,710
example you could do this for every

00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:26,140
language that your project supports or

00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:27,850
for every theme that your project

00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:30,760
supports or whatever and you end up with

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,290
a bunch of screenshots and for the

00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,820
application I'm working on you can find

00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,830
the repository with the screenshot

00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,450
definitions and also the utility code

00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:39,160
there is a bit more complicated than

00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,890
I've shown here in this github

00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,240
repository and thank you very much if

00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:46,500
you have any questions on that feel free

00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,500
to talk to me in the hallway

00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,010
thank you

00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:59,639
hello

00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:02,570
it's time for our story today's story is

00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:06,570
that's not my emoji

00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:07,399
that's not my emoji its head is too

00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:10,769
shiny

00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:17,550
this is two emoji put together this is

00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:21,389
not an emoji this is not my emoji its

00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:29,029
face is far too animated can you make a

00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:29,029
unicorn sound emojis do not have sound

00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:35,490
this is not my emoji its existence as a

00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:37,459
character in a movie it's far too

00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:41,100
distressing

00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:43,620
you see when a studio loves a marketing

00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,480
opportunity too much they can make a

00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,220
terrible movie out of it where a bunch

00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:55,920
of the main characters aren't actually

00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:59,399
emoji that's not my emoji it is partying

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:04,220
far too hard you see the pretty bird

00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,220
he's dancing emoji do not dance

00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:13,949
that's not my emoji it's permutations

00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:19,370
are under documented can you wave at the

00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:19,370
Chi mochi hello

00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:26,000
that's not my emoji

00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:29,190
it's ligatures only vendor implemented

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,630
you see the cat drinking coffee cats

00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:37,339
don't drink coffee and this only appears

00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:37,339
on Windows 10 operating systems

00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:45,970
that is my emoji it's code point is so

00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:47,380
standardized and that's the end of our

00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:53,179
story

00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:53,179
[Applause]

00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,790
okay sorry about that so yeah this is a

00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:02,410
talk about crypto but it's not a talk

00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:05,020
about that stupid and you think this is

00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:08,310
a talk about the original crypto which

00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:13,210
of course is cryptozoology the study of

00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:14,350
cryptids or legendary stroke mysterious

00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:16,990
creatures you know we're talking

00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:18,970
Bigfoot's and chupacabras and the

00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:20,920
Michigan dog-faced man and all of these

00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:22,330
wonderful things and the reason I'm

00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,000
interested in cryptids at the moment is

00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:26,800
that last week I was in Ohio and I went

00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,900
bats texting with my wife Natalie in the

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,250
woods in the dark and it was dark and it

00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,050
was the woods in hire we realized that

00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,520
we haven't really done our research and

00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:35,860
this is America there are weird

00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,300
creatures out here we didn't know if we

00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,400
were within the range of any of these

00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,560
mythical creatures and I'd like to know

00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:45,670
so that I can greet them and say hi so

00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:50,910
I'm I obviously hit Twitter and on

00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:52,930
Twitter I said so just out of interest

00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:55,360
does anyone know where I can retain

00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:57,640
range maps of quit to cryptozoological

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,230
creatures like yetis and chupacabras and

00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,550
so forth and then I asked a question

00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,200
about it on ask metafilter

00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:04,270
and I realized that actually no the

00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,530
internet does not have a conclusive

00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:09,189
source of range maps for different

00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:13,300
cryptozoological creatures so I started

00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:14,890
to get hub repository and this is this

00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,540
is a github repository which I would

00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:18,400
actively encourage people to contribute

00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:20,770
to where I am trying to get a directory

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,900
of information on cryptids and their

00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:25,360
ranges and so the way I'm doing this is

00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,860
using a file format called geo JSON it's

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,990
brilliant formats a way of representing

00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:32,050
geographical shapes in JSON so let's

00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:34,570
take a look at the Loveland frogmen this

00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:36,010
is my geo JSON file for the Loveland

00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:37,720
fragment a great thing about I'm github

00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:40,090
is that github knows how to render geo

00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,310
JSON so it's rendering this shape for me

00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:44,380
but if I click on that shape I can see

00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:47,830
that it's got a Wikipedia URL the name

00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:51,040
it was first sighted in last seen in

00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:53,770
1972 and it's a humanoid frog described

00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:56,440
as standing roughly four feet tall so

00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,730
that was my first cryptid I have been

00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,100
you know what I've got some pull

00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:02,350
requests Russell has sent me a pull

00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:06,400
request adding the drop bear I'm going

00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:08,230
to merge this right now and if I'm lucky

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,520
it will deploy by the end of my

00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,380
lightning talk I should have done this

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,720
minutes ago so we now have a dropout

00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,800
it's very exciting so you get the idea

00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,540
so then what am i doing with this data

00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,010
well so I'm working I've been working

00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,930
this open source project called dataset

00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:22,630
which is a application that takes a

00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:24,220
sequel like database and gives you a UI

00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,810
for exploring it and it gives you an API

00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:28,410
for getting the data back out as well

00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:31,080
and it's the perfect application for

00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:33,970
cryptozoology so what I've done here is

00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:36,400
this github repository it has Travis set

00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:38,530
up to run a script every time I commit

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,300
anything and the script reads in the Geo

00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:44,620
JSON and writes it into a sequel like

00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:47,080
databases 23 lines of code there is not

00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,220
a lot to this and so builds a builds a

00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,740
sequel like database with all these

00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:53,860
cryptids it deploys it and then based on

00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:55,210
this I can build out an API so here is

00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,650
the nice thing about dataset

00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:58,540
everything's sequel Lite so the API is

00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:01,150
just a sequel query here is a sequel

00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:04,960
query that selects details of cryptids

00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:06,940
where the geometry overlaps the where

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,920
with in Gion tech so where the geometry

00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,810
overlaps a point here's our current last

00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:13,000
year longitude right now and if I run

00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:14,980
that query I get back the Bigfoot it

00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,670
turns out America has a lot of Bigfoot

00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,930
sightings so this is now a JSON API

00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,580
which you can feed latitudes and

00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:24,040
longitudes to and it will tell you which

00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:25,720
cryptozoological creatures are where you

00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,640
are within range of his Travis

00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,140
oh look Travis is and building the drop

00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,850
there right now so if we're lucky

00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,470
that'll be built and deployed in just a

00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,840
moment and I'll talk about Bigfoot

00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:37,150
quickly it turns out there is already a

00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:40,780
database of Bigfoot sightings run by the

00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:42,460
Bigfoot organization who are banned from

00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:45,430
Twitter if you try and tweet a link to

00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,780
BFRO dotnet you get an error message so

00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:50,440
clearly Twitter were part of a cover-up

00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:51,910
conspiracy trying to hide the trying to

00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,920
hide the existence of Bigfoot but

00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:57,220
they've got 3,000 sightings they publish

00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,810
a KML file a KML file has latitudes and

00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,940
longitudes in I happen to know that the

00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:02,230
range of Bigfoot is 15 miles from a

00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,090
conversation I had at the Bigfoot

00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:07,450
Discovery Museum outside of Santa Cruz

00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:08,530
thoroughly recommended if you take those

00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:10,840
3,000 points

00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:11,800
and put a 50-mile radius on them you can

00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,390
see that Bigfoot's have been sighted

00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,100
across much of the United States

00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,420
everywhere in Florida it turns out

00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:19,720
everyone flawed has seen a Bigfoot and

00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:22,150
here in San Diego so when I ran that

00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,380
query with our San Diego coordinate um I

00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,780
did get back the big

00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:27,130
I've got a iost shortcut that I that

00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,380
isn't working at the moment so I can say

00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:31,480
hey Siri check for cryptids that's very

00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,160
useful and if you want something a bit

00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,289
more useful I do have a version of this

00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,299
that works for time zones instead and so

00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:39,760
please take a look at the project draw

00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:41,230
maps of cryptozoological creatures since

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,750
they probably don't exist you don't have

00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:46,030
to be very accurate and and let me know

00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:48,640
how it goes on and before I get hugged

00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:52,720
I'm just going to quickly see if Russ's

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,250
drop bear has deployed yet unfortunately

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,200
it looks like the drop bear did not

00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,520
quite make it but in a couple of minutes

00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,650
there will be a drop bear so thank you

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:03,259
very much

00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:03,259
[Applause]

00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:12,059
all right again thank you okay this is

00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:15,210
the first presentation I've given a very

00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:16,649
long time rhyme this was from something

00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,600
I did literally eight years ago so I'm

00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:20,369
gonna try and do this really quickly in

00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,440
2010 I was at a place called the Santa

00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:25,259
Fe Institute for a summer program and

00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,549
they asked us to like create various

00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:28,139
research projects so me and some friends

00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:31,940
stuck something together in three weeks

00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:33,840
which was a django app which you'll see

00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,850
for years

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,679
that should have said yeah four years

00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:39,360
later I got diagnosed with a really

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,429
complicated situation which is why I've

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,200
had three surgeries and why I can't have

00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:43,710
this part of my glasses on that side of

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,720
my face

00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,220
long story still managed to get a PhD in

00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,039
sociology now I'm trying to figure out

00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:52,110
what to do it went so well my most

00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:59,369
recent surgery in June that I'm here and

00:21:52,110 --> 00:22:01,409
I'm really really happy to be and my

00:21:59,369 --> 00:22:03,389
github name is spool if any theater

00:22:01,409 --> 00:22:04,769
nerds who know Krapp's Last Tape get

00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:07,230
that reference please see me after

00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:09,210
because very few people do right okay so

00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:11,999
the project was to try to study how

00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:13,980
people create collaborate creatively and

00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:17,999
how they might respond to each other and

00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:20,070
making a design and I'm gonna skip over

00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:22,200
that because that was a lot of again

00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:24,480
some things I had before you can ask me

00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,809
stuff about but basically like if we're

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,240
working together on making a design what

00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:33,419
do how do people respond to each other's

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,100
things people may be aware of the whole

00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:39,240
reddit project that came a couple years

00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:41,999
ago this came before that technically in

00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:46,350
2010 and you'll see some differences in

00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:48,330
the user interface so the idea was we

00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:51,360
printed a t-shirt at the end that was

00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:53,999
gonna be a black t-shirt by default and

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:57,029
then we were gonna put some designs on

00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:59,190
it we wrote it in Django and a language

00:22:57,029 --> 00:23:00,929
called processing which is really cool

00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:03,419
for doing some user interface and sound

00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:05,940
experiment stuff there was a processing

00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:07,649
j/s back then which was really slow

00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,450
there's now p5.js which i really

00:23:07,649 --> 00:23:13,249
recommend people try if they'd like to

00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:15,629
we did is we created a grid with 64

00:23:13,249 --> 00:23:17,340
cells or squares that people could do

00:23:15,629 --> 00:23:19,320
their own designs on and that whole

00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:21,090
thing became the canvas

00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,130
and you could only see your more

00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:24,690
neighbors can I see a pair of hands our

00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:29,190
hands for anyone who knows what a Mohr's

00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:36,899
neighbor is okay do you want to tell

00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:40,380
everyone what that is fine okay

00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:44,250
that's cool you'll see it in a second so

00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:46,259
this is just an example of how we've run

00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:49,019
it in a museum recently so you get

00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:50,309
assigned a square in this big grid and

00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:55,379
you can only see the edges of your

00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:58,860
neighbors so if you there's the the ones

00:23:55,379 --> 00:24:00,389
to the left right top and bottom and

00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:03,289
then there's the ones on the corners so

00:24:00,389 --> 00:24:07,409
those eight are the Moores neighborhood

00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:11,730
so you can press spacebar do a design

00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:13,200
and then press spacebar at the end and

00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:19,669
you see how your design fits alongside

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:26,909
the designs of everyone else okay so

00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:30,960
play again so that was that so that was

00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:32,610
the you had you could log back in so

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,929
when we rented it at a museum you could

00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:35,789
only do one design and then see the

00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:37,110
whole canvas way we read it rent as a

00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:38,639
website is you could log in you could

00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:40,590
only see your neighbors and then if you

00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:41,610
logged in the next day you might see how

00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:44,970
your neighbors changed and then you

00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:47,610
could respond so we had a couple of

00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:49,230
problems is someone logged in and then

00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:50,610
left it for an hour and then log back in

00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:53,190
their neighbors might have changed and

00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:55,500
then they could they would log in and we

00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:57,299
ended up they would accidentally not

00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,159
respond to the most recent changes of

00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:03,450
their neighbors we should have done that

00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:05,129
with WebSockets we also didn't take into

00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:06,750
account time zones so someone's laptop

00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:08,519
was on a different time zone and they

00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,960
kept overriding everyone else's and we

00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:15,419
didn't know why that was really

00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,800
frustrating so this is what it looked

00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:18,509
like

00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:21,489
[Music]

00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:29,559
so each of those cubes are individual

00:25:21,489 --> 00:25:31,809
people's designs a lot of the music that

00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:33,340
was when a dude tried to do his own and

00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:36,850
then accidentally overwrite everyone

00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:38,080
else's and it's a tourist so the

00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:39,340
people's on this on each side can

00:25:38,080 --> 00:26:03,730
actually see each other and the people

00:25:39,340 --> 00:26:05,499
on the tops can see the bottoms good job

00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,669
so that was the final thing if anyone's

00:26:05,499 --> 00:26:08,679
interested in music you just heard

00:26:06,669 --> 00:26:10,899
that's by a really incredible composer

00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:15,710
named Julius Eastman who sadly died in

00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:20,259
poverty in 1990 look thank you

00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:20,259
[Applause]

00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:29,610
hello I'm Ernest I really like to tweet

00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,680
I'm you might think the tweeting is my

00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:34,020
full-time job based on this incredible

00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,430
brand engagement but reality I work for

00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:38,760
the Python Software Foundation

00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:40,290
I also tweet a lot and so if you want to

00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,330
follow me that's where you do it on

00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,960
Twitter but yeah the Python Software

00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:44,880
Foundation

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,830
so the Python Software Foundation if

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,070
you're not aware is a non-profit that

00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:52,440
controls the intellectual property

00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:55,080
copyright trademark etc for Python the

00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,240
language also it is a grant giving

00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,410
nonprofit and so we raise money and we

00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,750
pour that money back into the community

00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:03,890
in order to support events like this

00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:06,630
meetups and smaller events as well

00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:08,130
there's a larger event associated with

00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,840
the Python software of a nation called

00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:12,150
PyCon if you're not familiar with Python

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,970
it was in Cleveland in 2019 it's gonna

00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:17,340
be in Cleveland in 2018 it's gonna be in

00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:20,100
Cleveland in 2019 and I want to talk

00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:22,950
briefly about that currently the call

00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:25,890
for call for proposals for Python is

00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:28,820
open you can check that URL out to go

00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:32,280
submit a talk tutorial education summit

00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:35,970
previous presentation poster or HR 'less

00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:38,460
or a talk in Spanish speaking of talks

00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:40,140
in Spanish the pike on Charlie's came

00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,430
out of the pike on hatchery program and

00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,170
so this is kind of what I really want to

00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:47,190
pitch to you the pike on hatchery

00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:49,020
program is a way for your ideas to be

00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:50,760
realized in Pike on so if you've ever

00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:53,040
been to pecan and not seeing something

00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,650
that you wanted to see this would be the

00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,870
way that you would tell us what you want

00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:01,500
to see and perhaps even propose to do

00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:02,970
the work to make it so so please check

00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,850
out the hatchery program and read more

00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:13,290
about that so you might be saying okay

00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:15,140
like MJ gokon so what about Django the

00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:17,910
Python Software Foundation loves Django

00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:19,800
we actually so I'm the director of

00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:21,920
infrastructure and so that's like a

00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,600
bunch of services that run on Python org

00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:27,540
out of that seven of them are currently

00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:32,179
written in Django the PyCon website is

00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:37,009
written in Django and I love Django

00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:40,049
admission I haven't always loved Django

00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:43,620
but but it's gotten much easier in the

00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:46,080
past few years and so being here and

00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:48,240
being among people who are interested in

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,730
or experts in Django has been really

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,029
exciting and so I'm also gonna come up

00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:56,789
here and ask for your help I frequently

00:28:54,029 --> 00:29:00,649
tweet and sometimes I tweet about asking

00:28:56,789 --> 00:29:00,649
for help in Python and Django

00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:05,809
more often than not when I'm tweeting

00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:07,740
about Django it's asking for help so

00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:10,409
help please

00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:12,779
and when I say this I mean this

00:29:10,409 --> 00:29:15,210
sincerely if you are in this room it is

00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:16,799
probably because Django is either made

00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,659
you feel like you have superpowers or

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,360
you want to feel what it feels like to

00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:24,809
have superpowers and I want you to be

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,940
involved in Django and the PSF and PyCon

00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:28,769
if any of that's true

00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:30,149
you might just be starting out and I'd

00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:32,460
love to work with you to get you started

00:29:30,149 --> 00:29:34,590
you might be an expert and I would love

00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,299
to work with you to get a little bit

00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:40,070
more of expertise and so that we can all

00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:44,070
share and grow so there's also a bonus

00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:46,320
it's not Django but pie pie is piece

00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:47,669
software many of you in the room might

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,590
be familiar with and if you're at all

00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:53,490
interested in contributing to pie pie we

00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:56,519
have stickers now you can you can check

00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:58,919
out a micro sprint that's gonna be

00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:02,190
occurring at lunch with myself and

00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:05,570
Dustin Ingram and that's it I'm Ernest

00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:10,970
and you can follow me on Twitter there

00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:10,970
[Applause]

00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:19,880
okay so I'm going to talk about you get

00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:21,679
folks about one plus one equals one or

00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,529
record a duplication in Python this is a

00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:28,100
45-minute talk I'm will make it in five

00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:30,919
minutes not sure if you work so real

00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:32,659
word data is a mess probably dealt with

00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:35,990
data like this before

00:30:32,659 --> 00:30:39,649
those are restaurants restaurant records

00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:41,539
and you see here that clearly those four

00:30:39,649 --> 00:30:43,279
records here from zero to three are

00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:45,409
duplicates because the name is quite

00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:48,350
similar there was a similar city came

00:30:45,409 --> 00:30:50,480
arrive so we have duplicates the here

00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:53,090
real world data's a mess we don't have

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,490
unique identifiers and the solution is

00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:57,679
to perform the duplication also known as

00:30:55,490 --> 00:31:00,559
record linkage to join records in a

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:03,529
fusee way using data like names and

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:05,360
addresses mostly we will deal with those

00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:09,110
kinds of days but can be other kinds of

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:12,169
dates and to solve that we should do

00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:14,889
some fusee comparison of strings we can

00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:17,840
use algorithms like Jarrow in color

00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:19,880
similarity if I compute the general

00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,760
similarity between those two similar

00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:25,309
strings I get this high number and with

00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:28,549
those different strings I get this lower

00:31:25,309 --> 00:31:31,250
number so I can use that too as a tip

00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:33,830
for me as an indication of similarity

00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:37,039
between records I can do also few

00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:39,110
comparisons of addresses and the trick

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:41,360
is to geocode them to like to the

00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:44,029
longitude and that our allow us to clean

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:48,049
irrelevant address variations like a

00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:50,600
small variation on on the street number

00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:53,090
or something like that and to enable the

00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,649
calculation of geometric distance using

00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:56,570
latitude and longitude because we want

00:31:54,649 --> 00:32:00,830
to group and match things that are close

00:31:56,570 --> 00:32:02,570
together and if I geocode those through

00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:04,850
addresses here you can see that out

00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:07,789
though they have variations and even

00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:10,309
typos the latitude and longitude is the

00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:12,980
same and the zip codes Isis is also the

00:32:10,309 --> 00:32:15,889
same I can grab this from Google

00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:18,529
geocodes for example ok now into the

00:32:15,889 --> 00:32:21,080
process of duplicating a data set

00:32:18,529 --> 00:32:24,460
first we need to process it we will use

00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:26,750
the restaurant data set it contains 881

00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,320
restaurant records from the folders

00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:30,020
inside

00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,880
it's guides and it contains 150

00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:34,670
duplicates and we want to find those

00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:37,520
duplicates the dollar set looks like

00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:40,310
this so it comes with the closer column

00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:43,250
which is the truth about this data of

00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:45,950
course we remove that and we will also

00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:49,130
remove the phone column because it will

00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:52,490
make things very easy for us and we left

00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:55,790
only with name address and city and we

00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:58,310
want to duplicate using only that first

00:32:55,790 --> 00:33:01,190
we clean just using some rig access to

00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:03,380
clean then the name will geo code out

00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:07,220
the addresses so we get the post a lot

00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:09,710
to the longitude for the addresses and

00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,570
then we can move to the next step or on

00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:14,810
the record linkage process which is

00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:16,640
indexing we will use the library record

00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:20,030
linkage also known as Python record

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:22,910
linkage to get and we have the cleaner

00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:25,490
records now we want the pairs to compare

00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:27,290
to find matches to produce the Paris we

00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:29,000
could do a full index we could compare

00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:31,790
our records against our records of

00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,160
course that's slow but we don't have

00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:36,710
enough time to think about a smarter way

00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:39,020
to index so we just produce our records

00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:42,080
against our records and the person looks

00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:44,600
like look like this will compare zero

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:48,260
with one zero with two and there it goes

00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:50,240
now running the comparisons we want to

00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:52,910
compare the pair's to get a comparison

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,710
vector for each pair so the comparison

00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:58,730
vector looks like this

00:33:54,710 --> 00:34:02,210
the names are similarities 0.5 the other

00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:05,240
similar 0.8 and that's our comparison

00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:07,670
vector and to compute the similar the

00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:10,490
comparison vectors we define similarity

00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:13,310
functions for each column we can do that

00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:15,800
with the record linkage to KITT we use

00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:18,740
Jerry Winkler for name address posto and

00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,060
an exponential decay geometric

00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:23,780
similarity between latitude and

00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:26,660
longitude and that's what we get if we

00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:28,400
run that now with the vectors we want to

00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:32,210
explore different ways to classify them

00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:34,100
as matches and no matches and we can do

00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:36,260
some simple threshold basic

00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:40,120
classification we can compute a weighted

00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:42,340
average over those vectors

00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:44,860
and by looking at data we see that those

00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:50,140
three are matches so we just consider

00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:53,980
anything with more than 0.9 of a score

00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:56,170
as a match and if we do that and compute

00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:59,830
from the truth about this data we see

00:34:56,170 --> 00:35:02,680
that we got 128 true positives and two

00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:05,440
false positives only two false positives

00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:08,110
and 22 false negatives so it's quite

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:11,050
good performance but other smarter ways

00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:14,170
to solve that problem make sure to check

00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:16,450
active learning classification it will

00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:18,450
help you a lot because it will allow you

00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:21,270
to build a training set for you

00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:25,989
[Music]

00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:25,989
[Applause]

00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:39,119
okay so I said in Philippi and partner

00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:42,240
said veinte and let's talk about parks

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:44,579
so I haven't even image here of two

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,579
layouts for a park trail or something

00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:50,160
like that and I want you to think about

00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:56,970
which one of those you think is their

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:58,200
more pleasant trail for park so to be

00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:00,450
honest that this is a very trick

00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:04,349
question I didn't give you enough

00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:06,119
information to answer that and the

00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:07,380
reason is you don't know enough you

00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:08,940
don't know anything about the terrain

00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:11,910
you don't know anything about this if

00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:14,940
there are trees around have no idea of

00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:17,190
what what's going on in that area so to

00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:19,770
answer that kind of questions you need

00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:21,900
something like this book which called a

00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:26,280
pattern language from Christopher

00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:29,250
Alexander and it's from 1977 and this

00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:33,569
guy he defined a series series of

00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:37,710
patterns and things to help architects

00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:41,940
to build and design good and do good

00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:45,359
architecture so for example you can take

00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:48,329
the pattern 120 which about paths and

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:50,430
goes and it says the layout of path who

00:36:48,329 --> 00:36:52,290
sing write and comfortable only when

00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:54,510
it's compatible with the process of

00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:56,300
walking and the process of walking is

00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:58,890
far more suitable than one might imagine

00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:01,380
this is very interesting especially

00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:04,200
because it can be visualized through

00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:06,869
this thing called desire paths desire

00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,640
paths are like in this image they show

00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:12,780
how people interact with the place they

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:17,400
live through like these patterns in the

00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:20,490
terrain so for instance here we are

00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,410
seeing there are two paths going one

00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:24,300
that goes straight to the door but there

00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:26,490
is a fence and not having the good that

00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:29,700
goes around so probably at some point

00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:31,920
that fence didn't exist there and people

00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:37,109
just change the way they they went

00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:40,290
inside the house after that also this

00:37:37,109 --> 00:37:42,090
other example so in this case people are

00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:45,450
going around trees

00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:48,030
and here's very interesting because like

00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:51,870
they got the desired pattern the desired

00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:57,660
path and actually made it a fixed path

00:37:51,870 --> 00:38:00,600
and a proper path so one thing to

00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:03,150
remember and this comes from this idea

00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:06,120
of patterns and paths is that when you

00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:10,410
see a big street mainly when it's all

00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:12,960
one Main Avenue in a city probably at

00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:17,730
some point there was a bear

00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:21,300
Road in the woods and maybe before that

00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:26,400
there was just a path where people and

00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:28,590
animals passed by and so those are

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,170
patterns and this this is from

00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:33,960
Christopher the author of the book and

00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:35,340
he says this idea comes simply from the

00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,080
observation that most of the own

00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:40,800
wonderful place of the world were not

00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:43,880
made by architects but by people so the

00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,950
book is really very based on these on

00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:50,580
how architecture is built by is made by

00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:54,180
people in and control naturally so the

00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:57,860
book has other partners and first of all

00:38:54,180 --> 00:39:05,640
the path shape one there is sit spots so

00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:07,500
when you it's okay so there's another

00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:10,140
part that's missing here which saw what

00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:12,900
language so it's a pattern language we

00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:14,760
talk about pattern and language it's

00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,130
just like when you have words you have

00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:19,770
words that have separate meeting by each

00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:21,660
of them and when you group that together

00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:23,640
you got a lot more meaning fruit

00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:26,220
language so languages as a group you

00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:30,120
group words to convey a lot more meaning

00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:33,420
and that's where we get huge design

00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:36,000
patterns so giant patterns was actually

00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,350
created the book we know the software

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,820
book we know it was actually created

00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:43,470
based on Christopher's book and I don't

00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,960
have a lot of time to talk about like

00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:49,920
design patterns here but like it's just

00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:52,980
that that idea that comes from so let's

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,840
just you jump to something away so for

00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,830
since I partners are not created they're

00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,170
more

00:39:55,830 --> 00:40:00,570
so just like the Christopher's partners

00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:04,440
our design patterns are just observation

00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:05,670
from how people code sign partners are

00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,910
two for communication between

00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:10,410
programmers free speech and code they

00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:13,260
are not to brag about they are to help

00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:15,480
you communicate with your teammates and

00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:17,760
the last thing I want to leave to you is

00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,410
that that quote that says good

00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,450
architecture is about improving people's

00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:23,970
lives and most of the time this means

00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:25,710
that what feels more natural or more

00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:29,340
pleasant to us and this applies to both

00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:29,970
to architecture and to programming thank

00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:37,819
you

00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:37,819
