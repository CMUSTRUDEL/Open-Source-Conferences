	DjangoCon US 2018 - "State of Django" Panel by Simon Willison

Join us for a panel on the State of Django: the state of the Django codebase, but also the state of the Django community as represented by organizations like the Django Software Foundation, Django Girls, and DEFNA.

Moderated by Simon Willison, our panelists will discuss:

how we can continue to grow the Django community and create a welcoming space for beginners
the priorities for the continued development and maturation of Django
ways to improve Django events and bring them to new regions worldwide
success stories from Django communities
concrete steps toward better and more effective diversity and inclusion efforts
and much more. Itâ€™s been a long time since we gathered leaders of the Django community on one stage to have an open-ended discussion about Djangoâ€™s present and future, and we hope youâ€™ll join us for this special event.
