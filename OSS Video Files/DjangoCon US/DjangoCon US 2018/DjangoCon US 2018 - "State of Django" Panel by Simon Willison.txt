	DjangoCon US 2018 - "State of Django" Panel by Simon Willison

Join us for a panel on the State of Django: the state of the Django codebase, but also the state of the Django community as represented by organizations like the Django Software Foundation, Django Girls, and DEFNA.

Moderated by Simon Willison, our panelists will discuss:

how we can continue to grow the Django community and create a welcoming space for beginners
the priorities for the continued development and maturation of Django
ways to improve Django events and bring them to new regions worldwide
success stories from Django communities
concrete steps toward better and more effective diversity and inclusion efforts
and much more. Itâ€™s been a long time since we gathered leaders of the Django community on one stage to have an open-ended discussion about Djangoâ€™s present and future, and we hope youâ€™ll join us for this special event.

Panelists
Andrew Godwin
Anna Makarudze

00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:21,539
okay yes excellent so high yeah this is

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,300
some so the original idea for this panel

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,650
was to be a sort of state of Django

00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,720
talking about the code and then we

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,820
realized that the more the Django

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,619
community is far more interesting than

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,210
these sort of nuts and bolts of the

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,890
Django framework itself so we've

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,469
assembled a panel of representatives

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,420
from a whole bunch of exciting projects

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,250
that help make up that Django ecosystem

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,320
and I've actually started thinking about

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,239
this more in terms of this is a what can

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,760
the Django project learned from the

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,280
Django community panel so in that light

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,230
and we've got a fantastic group of

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,149
panelists alum ask them to introduce

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,070
themselves briefly and then we'll we'll

00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:04,439
start the conversation so Andrew could

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:07,020

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,150
panelists

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,590
so I wanted to start by talking about

00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,840
Django girls because honestly I think

00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,390
Django girls is an incredibly inspiring

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,700
project and we're very lucky that it

00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,440
chose to attach itself to Django as a

00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,660
community I feel like it's one of the

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,480
most vibrant and exciting parts of the

00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,560
of the Django ecosystem so Rachel could

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,690
you give us some of the latest

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,660
highlights on on how on how the Django

00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,670
girls organization is shaping up yeah so

00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,630
I sign up

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:24,720
so we've we have 69 upcoming events a

00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:27,450
671 past events and total number of

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,000
applicants forty-three thousand eight

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,100
hundred eighty-five that and people that

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,150
have actually attended event 16 past

00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:39,950
16,000 and in that's in 94 different

00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,950
countries so yeah

00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,790
and last year there was the impact

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,980
report and we sent out surveys to try to

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,680
see where people are now because we

00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:55,829
hadn't been tracking that and from the

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,680
responses we got 21% of participants

00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:01,170
that came to our workshop they started

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,290
into tech after that and now they're

00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:08,280
working in tech so I just think that's

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:09,569
astonishing um so uh Anna you've could

00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,519
you give us an update on how general

00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:18,870
Golz is shaping up in Africa we have an

00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,859
okay many events happening mostly in

00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,560
Nigeria

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,660
I think Nigeria is recorded the highest

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,580
number of events but we have events

00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,610
happening across Africa South Africa

00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:32,580
Zimbabwe Namibia Ghana and many other

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,539
countries so Jang bogos has been

00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,750
instrumental

00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:39,150
not only in impacting women in reducing

00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,100
them through technology and coding but

00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:43,110
it has also helped us grow our

00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,570
communities because every other country

00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,729
that's developing the operator community

00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,590
they are studying by organizing django

00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:51,270
girls and then they move on to pi cones

00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,320
in other events so it has really been

00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:56,490
helpful for us as a continent in

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,389
developing the Python community in

00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:03,449
advancing the use of Python in Africa

00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:05,490
and so instant the DSF actually have

00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:07,800
funds younger girls events um could you

00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:10,050
talk through some of how that works yeah

00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,510
so actually it's one of the bigger uses

00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:14,370
of DSF funds it kind of goes paying for

00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,810
the fellows and then funding Jago girls

00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,150
events then funding other types of

00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,430
django events and and specific types of

00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,349
development but yeah it's been really

00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,449
successful we we actually have had to

00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:26,940
move to kind of having it be part of a

00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,349
consent agenda for the DSF board

00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,120
meetings so that we don't end up taking

00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:32,520
up most of our board meeting saying yes

00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,389
yes yes yes yes to all these new Django

00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,520
girls events fantastic um so on that

00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:39,990
sort of topic I feel like one of the

00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,180
things that Django Girls brings to the

00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,909
Django community is a fantastic focus on

00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,220
on education and sort of helping people

00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:49,620
get started with learning how to achieve

00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,510
their goals in web development with with

00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,969
Django is the sort of substrate there so

00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,090
I open question to the panel and how can

00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:56,530
we Double Down

00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,350
and become the open source community

00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:04,449
with the best possible education

00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:07,360
experience for newcomers Oh I'll kind of

00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:10,630
start us off I guess from because I am a

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,400
career changer so I've kind of

00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,680
experienced both both ways as a

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,100
participant as an organizer and as a

00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,949
coach

00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,360
so obviously resources there's a

00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:21,220
jangler's tutorial that's great but then

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,760
what next right and I think that's

00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:27,850
something we could improve on roadmap

00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:29,290
more resources or just a way to go after

00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,669
that um luckily I had people around me

00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,870
to help me with that but not not

00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:34,540
everyone is like that and that's the

00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:36,729
next thing is mentorship it's hard to

00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,010
find them so if you're a developer I

00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,960
encourage you to reach out and help

00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:45,419
junior developers or people that are

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,419
interested in getting into tech right

00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:58,240
and sort of follow on from that what

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:59,860
makes a good mentor like there we go I

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,229
think one of the things that is

00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,760
important as far as mentoring people is

00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:05,740
the fact that you actually care about

00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,479
that person's advancement and their

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:10,260
improvement as far as their skills or

00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:13,180
whatever it is they're trying to do so

00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:14,860
oftentimes mentoring looked at with

00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,840
regard to how much technical skill the

00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,150
mentor has but I think the reality is if

00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,500
you actually genuinely care about that

00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:22,240
person making some sort of progression

00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,919
towards whatever the Golders they're

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,330
trying to reach that's one of the more

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,889
important criteria because if you care

00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,440
about that person's advancement you'll

00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:32,110
do what you need to do to help them find

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,130
the in one help them figure out what the

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,530
goal is that they're trying to achieve

00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,849
and then to help them find the resource

00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,979
the resources that they need to reach

00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:41,590
that goal so I think that's one of the

00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:43,539
more important things I also want to add

00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:47,169
that as a mentor admitting you don't

00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:48,430
know things helps people understand that

00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:49,720
you don't have to be perfect you don't

00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,000
have to know everything for me that was

00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,169
a huge moment when I was learning that

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,060
my mentor was like I know that's Google

00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:57,430
it and I was like oh okay that's okay to

00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:00,190
not know something and another thing is

00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:02,380
resources something I got from my

00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,669
mentors was just you know conference is

00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,710
coming up scholarship opportunities

00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:07,780
things like that that maybe you're not

00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,980
exposed to and you're not really in the

00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,090
tech field and if some

00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:14,230
I can share that with you that's that's

00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:15,790
better very valuable yeah I definitely

00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:17,410
echo that I always try if I'm entering

00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,850
somebody to tell him some story where I

00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:20,320
didn't know what I was doing

00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:22,120
and it took me forever to figure out

00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,620
that thing I think it puts people at

00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,480
ease and then just kind of having that

00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,100
kind of beginner mind what was what was

00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,870
stuff that tripped me up way back then

00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:31,150
and being able to kind of just do that

00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:33,150
that empathy of yeah I've been there too

00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:37,590
I remember I remember what that was like

00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:39,729
how suede did you have a jack a

00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:42,700
documentation and tutorial project that

00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:44,320
you were yes well actually one of the

00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,180
efforts that we're doing a deaf man is

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,890
trying to open a little bit more

00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,920
resources for people that would like to

00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:52,180
create events so I mean it does have to

00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,030
do with that with the topic at hand

00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:56,770
right now which is trying to teach other

00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:59,800
people right about everything that we

00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:02,080
that we can about travel programming and

00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,690
Django and all that all of that so a lot

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,850
of that actually happens in all of these

00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,770
different types of events I don't know

00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,570
all of those have to be really big

00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:12,520
events like for instance this one could

00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:15,000
be some other events like the ones that

00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,170
Django girls actually also do different

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,080
different type of tutorials and stuff

00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:21,970
like that one really good resource

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,800
actually it comes from Django Girls

00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,690
which is the handbook that they have to

00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,510
create events but we're trying to create

00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:31,030
more resources around us and just

00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:33,100
different guide books on how to to

00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:35,410
create different types of events so if

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:38,950
anybody has any questions about about

00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:40,690
how to actually start with that you can

00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:44,680
you can I don't know

00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:47,290
contact us I'd like to add we'd love to

00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,750
have assistance with with us and it's

00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:52,210
been a huge boost to have Josue join the

00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,700
board because he has kind of spearheaded

00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:57,630
this and we're doing a lot of new

00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:02,220
outreach not just you know in local

00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:04,540
communities but also internationally and

00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:08,110
it's really exciting because we're

00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:11,020
hoping to move beyond Django Khan it's

00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:15,580
been a new goal for us in the past year

00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:19,680
or so to move beyond Django Khan to also

00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,680
do outreach in local communities

00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:27,040
so yep this is a great opportunity to to

00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:29,720
talk about events because certainly

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,420
Django Girls is a very events focused

00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,250
organization Daphna has been doing an

00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,260
amazing job with with Django Khan and

00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,060
and trying to push into further events

00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,890
so sort of open questions to families

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:43,070
why why aren't there more Django cons

00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:49,610
around the world right now that's mostly

00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:51,590
the DSF boards doing so we we own the

00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:53,570
trademark around Django and so we and

00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:56,260
and Django Cohn and so weak we are the

00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:58,730
ones who let you have a Django con and

00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:02,360
the board's position on that has been

00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:04,130
the same for a long time that running a

00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,570
conference is very hard and most people

00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,220
don't realize really how hard it is and

00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:10,220
how much work goes into it deafness

00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:13,130
spends most of the year organizing this

00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,630
and is with a group of you know a dozen

00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,970
or more people working on it throughout

00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:20,690
the year just to make it happen and so

00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:22,730
if you're wanting Django con Fredonia in

00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:25,670
your country the worst thing you could

00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:27,500
do would be to have a conference that

00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:29,150
starts off and goes very badly for

00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,160
whatever reason cuz you'll never end up

00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,450
having Django confer donia again you

00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,410
won't be able to get sponsorship and you

00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:35,600
won't get be able to people to buy

00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:38,630
tickets so it's important that whoever

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,480
starts one has a lot of event planning

00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,970
experience and can show that they've got

00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,920
kind of lines on sponsorship lined up

00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,600
and and before we would grant one and

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,730
that's why there's only a couple of them

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,330
but that applies to these sort of Django

00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:55,430
con brands at the same time we're

00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:57,410
actively interested encouraging those as

00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,600
many of those smaller Django groups that

00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:01,310
aren't a takes a year to to plan a

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,720
conference thing to pop up as possible

00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,820
right yeah absolutely I mean if you want

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,370
to have Django weekend or you know

00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:10,010
Django Day in your city go for it

00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:12,920
you know let us know how we can help but

00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:15,070
the larger conferences we're kind of

00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:18,280
keeping the Django con name close hold

00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:20,840
so um one thing that I'd certainly

00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,670
realized this M this Django con is

00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,290
probably the most diverse technical

00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,850
conference I've ever been to which I

00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:28,130
think speaks poorly to my previous

00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:29,810
choice of conferences but I I'm but I

00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,640
would like to ask the deaf members on

00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:35,440
the panel how did you pull this off

00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,440
because this is this is not an accident

00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:44,390
so pretty much that's that's a hard

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,560
question actually kind of getting out of

00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:47,420
the way for a lot of people who want to

00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,310
help I think if we look back four or

00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,990
five years ago there was a much smaller

00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,550
group of people running the conference

00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,620
and so one of the things we wanted this

00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:57,260
to be is a community rain conference and

00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:59,120
so we tend to err on the side of giving

00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:01,280
you more access to do things you want to

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,980
do and in so far it's worked out pretty

00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,930
well for us every year - is an iteration

00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,270
of the previous year and seeing what

00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,080
worked what didn't work that's been

00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,850
pretty successful

00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,680
honestly I as somebody who doesn't like

00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,630
to do public speaking I have no problem

00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,330
not being on stage which is why Kojo is

00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:20,450
on stage for hours and hours each day

00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:23,030
which is great so I think that was a big

00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:25,340
factor we have a really good actionable

00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:27,050
code of conduct - so it's easy to keep

00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:29,180
nice people here because we can ask

00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:30,920
people who aren't nice to leave so I

00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:34,540
think that also was a factor as well and

00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,540
thank you for the compliment

00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:46,580
so I would say as the person who's

00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:48,140
onstage all the time one of the things

00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:51,380
and I have said this to to attendees

00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:52,820
here and as one of the members of a

00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:56,090
former definite board member into Gen

00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:57,800
Con us organizer of that group I think I

00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:00,230
am one of the more extroverted

00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,210
introverts and so I have said this to

00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:05,570
people as I interact with them the

00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:08,060
entire team has a very serious focus on

00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:10,400
trying to make django con as inclusive

00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:12,230
as possible so not just trying to reach

00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,730
out to people of different groups but to

00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:17,180
try but trying to create a conference

00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:18,500
environment such that when people from a

00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,810
variety of different groups come to

00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,700
django con you feel comfortable you feel

00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:25,010
welcomed because like we really

00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,450
legitimately truly want you to be here

00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,570
I mean what you'd have the actual best

00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:32,060
django con experience you can have and

00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:33,500
i'm like the big visual one who's saying

00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,540
it to people and kind of in your face

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,160
all the time but there's a whole other

00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,960
group of organizers that you might not

00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,900
see as much who feel the exact same way

00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,580
and so that's why you get that feeling

00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:49,520
here because we're all on the same page

00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:51,740
about that the organizers are okay I've

00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,870
never been an organizer for a different

00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,520
conference but so I don't know what

00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:58,690
other experiments people have but the

00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:01,340
organizers are absolutely constantly

00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:04,060
trying to find ways to make it more

00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:07,820
diverse and to bring underrepresented

00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:11,270
people in and it is such an important

00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:17,030
part of it I have experienced it myself

00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:21,680
and it has just drastically improved my

00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:24,710
own life from Jeff encouraging me to

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,570
become the website chair and that I

00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:31,580
wouldn't have thought of that for myself

00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:33,590
and it was something I wanted to do and

00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:36,680
it helped me learn and help me mentor

00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:38,750
other people and they are doing this

00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,460
everyone is doing this in the community

00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,820
as far as I can tell among the

00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,820
organizers

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:54,400
um Kojo you've been working as the the

00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:56,230
events ambassador for the north america

00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,820
what what are sort of the patterns that

00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,500
you've the sort of themes that you've

00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:03,340
noticed in those conversations you've

00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:05,260
been having well honestly the one thing

00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:08,650
that I've noticed it's a thing that I

00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:10,480
think we as the Django kind us folks

00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:12,400
need to maybe go a little bit better at

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,940
marketing-wise is that people often

00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:19,630
think that Django con is just for talks

00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:22,300
about Django and so so some people don't

00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:23,650
necessarily realize that what I've

00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,570
spoken to people and ask them to submit

00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:28,120
talks to Django con like oh I don't do a

00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:30,640
lot of Django but the reality is Django

00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:34,230
is an open-source web framework written

00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:37,840
in Python and so Python talks acceptable

00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:39,430
web related talks or about even about

00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,130
other web frameworks or about JavaScript

00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:44,230
kremens acceptable it's open source so

00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:45,460
it's mostly built by volunteers so talks

00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:48,040
that are related to the community and

00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,750
helping people maintain their volunteer

00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,740
efforts by not burning themselves out or

00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:54,370
dealing with their mental health issues

00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:56,320
or having a culture that is inclusive

00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:58,870
and welcoming to people all of those are

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,390
valid Django contacts and as I've gone

00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:05,050
to different events literally all around

00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:07,000
North America and also Australia I think

00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:08,830
that those sorts of values are

00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,730
represented in the different communities

00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:14,650
that I've been to so I'm interested in

00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:16,060
hearing more I one of the things I find

00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,800
fascinating for Django is how

00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,450
international the community has become

00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,850
so I'd be interested in hearing more

00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:26,020
about some of the event plans in Mexico

00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:28,180
and Africa from Josue and from ana yes

00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,890
well actually there's been some efforts

00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:32,740
also to try and bring all of these

00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:35,560
different type of events to Mexico right

00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:37,690
now the one thing that we have it's it's

00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:40,240
Python day Mexico and that's gonna

00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,680
happen next next month but the other

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,510
thing that also is gonna happen but it's

00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,820
gonna happen until next year and it's

00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:49,030
kind of like a first step is to create a

00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:50,890
page by Latin which is Latin American so

00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:54,220
that's going to be the first step to

00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:56,290
actually start to have more more events

00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,480
like this one and eventually probably a

00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,750
Django Cohen maybe we're going to start

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,190
with

00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,570
something like one day or something like

00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:03,790
that I don't want to give out too many

00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:06,070
details because those might change and

00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:08,650
there's other people also involving the

00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:10,480
whole organization of the event but this

00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:13,090
is also helping us out trying to figure

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,030
out what other resources do we need to

00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:17,440
give out or to to make public so for

00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:19,540
people that would like to start these

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,160
type of events and the whole point of

00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,410
these these events that are going to

00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:25,570
happen in Mexico and in other countries

00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:26,560
are also to be very international right

00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:29,380
for everybody

00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:31,510
I mean whoever can whoever actually can

00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:34,180
go to to these other countries and all

00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:36,190
that and also expose a talk or something

00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:38,320
like that or just contributing in any

00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:41,380
other way that's that's the whole idea

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:48,700
to make her a more bigger international

00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:52,180
community so far there have been new

00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:55,030
events PyCon events coming up with every

00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:58,960
year we started our own hike on Zimbabwe

00:18:55,030 --> 00:19:01,450
in 2016 Nigeria hit the pike office if I

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,960
couldn't win 17 this year Ghana in

00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:07,030
Europe icon and this this events

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,070
emanated from Piko Namibia the only

00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:12,340
country that she'd been running Pike won

00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:13,750
one South Africa and they've you see us

00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,400
they are a different so we are happy

00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:18,160
that there are new pythons coming up in

00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:20,590
Africa but there is in a plan for a

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,230
pan-african pike one that will not only

00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:24,910
cover one country but as many countries

00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:27,610
as that can be covered which we are

00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:29,760
planning for 2020 and we're also trying

00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:33,010
to come up with this small jungle event

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,320
possible maybe for 2019 or 2020 as well

00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:38,680
so those are the plants that we have in

00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:40,210
Africa for pike one as well is jungle

00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,580
event it is something that is

00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:45,100
continental and that's something that we

00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:48,070
are reaching out to the rest of the

00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,680
world if you want to participate by

00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:53,590
helping us with offense if you have been

00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,580
running a continental event we forgive

00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:57,610
you at the experience that you have had

00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:59,830
with the issues out here no visas in

00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:01,840
other administration issues that can

00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:04,630
come up any information that you may

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,280
have with regards to budgets financial

00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:09,480
aid and stuff like that would also we

00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,480
would appreciate that very much

00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:16,510
I just wanted to point something out and

00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:18,430
that is that we actually have two people

00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:21,670
from Mexico who joined our board this

00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:24,790
year Josue in kaca and we're also doing

00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:27,850
some Spanish language translation kaca

00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:31,540
has translated our website which will go

00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:33,850
live soon and we've done some tweets in

00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:37,120
Spanish and I'm also hoping that the

00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:39,580
documentation that is in the works for

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:43,350
local meetups that we might be able to

00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:43,350
do a translation of that also

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:55,630
on that note about internationalism and

00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:58,149
in Korea I started the channel girls

00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:59,769
soul and it took off it's it was a huge

00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:01,330
success but one of the things that made

00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:03,360
it so successful was all the work we

00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:05,590
needed translations of jail girls

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,080
tutorial right now it's translating to

00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:11,260
14 different languages and it's being

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:15,610
translated by volunteers so please help

00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:17,440
if you can into many others so that was

00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:22,240
my kind of plug on the International

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:24,580
scope so I'd like to move us on to

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,769
talking about Django core itself and so

00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:30,370
I'm going to call on James Bennett in a

00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:32,289
moment as a quick guest actually could

00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:36,010
we get us in will will will hand you a

00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:37,179
microphone so this was discussed a

00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:40,389
little bit yesterday but there is a

00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:42,789
proposal in the works to UM to introduce

00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:45,309
a completely new governance model to

00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:47,049
Django because right now Django core I

00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:49,389
will be honest does not look very much

00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:52,059
like the the make up of people in this

00:21:49,389 --> 00:21:54,760
room and furthermore Jack jagat that

00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:56,559
it's we need to start injecting this

00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,630
vitality and this freshness and these

00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,679
new ideas into the core framework the

00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,899
way the core framework itself has

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,539
developed so I'm James is the author of

00:22:01,899 --> 00:22:06,880
the DEP the Django enhancement proposal

00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:09,940
that some outlined this new governance

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,220
model and III James if you could if you

00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:14,049
could give us the the executive summary

00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:15,149
from the from the author author yourself

00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:18,639
that would be fantastic

00:22:15,149 --> 00:22:20,260
okay so the way that historically Django

00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:22,059
development has worked is there are

00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,620
certain people who have committed to the

00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:27,010
main repository we call those people

00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:29,590
Django core and they sort of get to make

00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:32,049
decisions and do what they want there

00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:33,909
was for a long time Jacob and Hadrian as

00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:35,470
sort of final decision makers now

00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:39,070
there's a technical board since they

00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:42,580
stepped down the proposal is get rid of

00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:45,370
that shut down the private django core

00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:47,590
mailing list and IRC channel move all of

00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:50,010
the governance of Django the framework

00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:52,630
on to the public Django developers list

00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:54,279
you may be wondering well if there are

00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:57,789
no more committers how does code get

00:22:54,279 --> 00:23:00,220
into Django the answer is already a lot

00:22:57,789 --> 00:23:00,980
of the commits that happen in Django are

00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,140
done by

00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,840
Elton and Tim who are the Django fellows

00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:08,210
who are paid by the DSF to do all sorts

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,360
of management around the Django source

00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:15,049
code repository the proposal is to

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,480
formalize a role of a merger this is not

00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:19,640
someone who just adds code on their own

00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,230
initiative it's someone who merges pull

00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,690
requests from other people after

00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:25,820
discussion and consensus on the public

00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:28,700
mailing list this does away with the

00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:30,049
need to have the sort of multi tier you

00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:33,169
know some people have special privileges

00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:35,210
and some people don't everybody would be

00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:37,490
equal on the Django developers list and

00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:39,230
it would be consensus driven as to what

00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:41,929
gets into Django the mergers would

00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:43,970
simply be a bureaucratic role there

00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:46,790
would still be a technical board elected

00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:49,070
from the Django developers mailing list

00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:51,340
every so often to act as a final

00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:53,330
decision-making backstop if we need one

00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,160
although I will say I've been on the

00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:58,850
technical board I think now for release

00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:00,410
cycles and we've had very little work to

00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:02,330
do so I would like to see that continue

00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:04,990
because it seemed like at least the

00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:07,730
consensus model seems to be working

00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:09,799
right um any thoughts from the panel on

00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:11,809
on this on this as a concept for

00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:14,690
governance going forward yeah in fact

00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:16,100
like one of these things I can talk

00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,679
about all he started happening so when I

00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,990
launched my big sort of proposal for

00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:23,660
like hey let's take Django make it all a

00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:25,400
synchronous I did that directly in

00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,049
public on the Django developers mailing

00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,000
list so like we have the private list

00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:30,740
the private list is not very busy but it

00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,540
does still exist and for many years we

00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,880
will drag it trying it rid of it okay

00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,559
let's just get rid not do that go

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,299
straight to public and try and get that

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,130
discussion and get and might see if

00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:42,679
there's any objection and like much to

00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:44,990
my surprise there was no objection like

00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:46,490
it was a near unanimous agreement for

00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:47,960
the community which is like you know I

00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:51,799
am occasionally personally a little bit

00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:53,600
suspicious of shall we say everyone

00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:54,830
agreeing once kind of based systems but

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,000
it seems to work with Django might be

00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:58,429
foster this kind of community that works

00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,720
and a technical board you know I'm also

00:24:58,429 --> 00:25:01,460
on it and we've had like one email in

00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,840
the last year I think it's like there's

00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,490
not much contentious going on right now

00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,500
so in that regard I think it's a good

00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:10,510
maybe not the complete solution is an

00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,510
excellent move forward for us

00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:17,030
anyone else got any input they want to

00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:19,850
make on this so first of all I think

00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:22,850
it's a great first step my concern is

00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:24,350
just you know we do have a problem it's

00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:26,900
an uncomfortable problem and I'm glad

00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:28,220
we're addressing it I've seen it notice

00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,840
like there's certain parts of Django

00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,480
we've noticed and even Django girls like

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,460
when when Django hired somebody to be

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,660
the fellow the the framework advance at

00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,330
a pace that we couldn't advance

00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:40,760
previously with Django girls to having a

00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:42,650
couple of ambassadors we've seen some

00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,240
huge improvements now where you know you

00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:46,730
have somebody who's paid to work on the

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,470
problems and fix things so my only

00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:50,690
concern is that I would love to see us

00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:52,160
take another step and hire somebody who

00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:54,440
is you know knows what they're doing

00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,960
with diversity and let's like head on

00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,160
reach and and let's you know let's fix

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,800
some of the various issues by bringing

00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,600
the next pert in but I love the stuff I

00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:07,400
think this is good but I would just love

00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:10,340
to see a little extra bit you know I've

00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:12,860
gone to the documentation and looked at

00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:16,250
the lists of people who are on

00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:18,920
committees and core committers and it's

00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:20,660
like for me that's the face of Django

00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,580
and a lot of these people go back to

00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:24,560
Lawrence Journal world or they've been

00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:26,570
around for a really long time and it's

00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:29,720
like they know the history of Django and

00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:31,850
have a lot of tribal knowledge and for

00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,610
me that was a psychological barrier of

00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:37,460
entry and just having the message that

00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:41,210
Carlton gave of welcome and saying that

00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:43,700
you're needed for me that makes me much

00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:47,680
more likely to contribute and I think

00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:49,880
that we are very often surfacing the

00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,160
accomplishments of these same people and

00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:56,200
that we need to make the face of Django

00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:59,120
more about the diverse community we are

00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,800
becoming and start surfacing new people

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:05,510
and new opportunities and this is a

00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:06,890
really good first step so a few people

00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:08,420
have mentioned the Django fellows now

00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:10,700
for anyone who's not familiar with that

00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:12,410
program there are two Django fellows who

00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:15,290
are actually employed by the Django

00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:18,320
Software Foundation essentially to do

00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:21,230
the bug triage and help manage releases

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,940
and the stuff which the the stuff that I

00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:24,169
don't want to say the tedious stuff but

00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,820
some of the sort of

00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:28,129
going work that needs to be done to keep

00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,809
the community healthy it's quite a rare

00:27:28,129 --> 00:27:32,389
model in open source actually and I

00:27:29,809 --> 00:27:33,980
think it's been extremely successful I'm

00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:35,960
really impressed with with with the

00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:38,840
impact that's had so my question for the

00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,429
panel is do you feel like the Django

00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,109
Fellows program is working well as it is

00:27:40,429 --> 00:27:45,109
I kind of loaded the question there and

00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:46,909
but also um do you see um how do you see

00:27:45,109 --> 00:27:49,489
that program expanding maybe with new

00:27:46,909 --> 00:27:51,649
responsibilities or other things that

00:27:49,489 --> 00:27:54,980
might help it work even better in short

00:27:51,649 --> 00:27:58,700
yes it's working really well we've seen

00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:00,230
a steady pace of releases security

00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,169
issues that come into the security

00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:04,399
mailing lists are dealt with and triage

00:28:02,169 --> 00:28:07,009
super quickly sometimes in less than a

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,989
couple of hours where with community

00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:11,389
resources that might have been a day or

00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:14,480
two and if it was a busy holiday weekend

00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:16,580
maybe several days so those parts of it

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,649
work really well I think one area where

00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:21,889
we could one we could have more fellows

00:28:18,649 --> 00:28:25,609
if we raised more money so Django could

00:28:21,889 --> 00:28:27,859
move faster and and more you had money

00:28:25,609 --> 00:28:30,470
to put behind projects like moving to a

00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:32,539
sink or like with the Mozilla grant for

00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:34,220
channels if we had if we had some piles

00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:36,429
of money like that and we could you know

00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:38,899
employ people to work on those problems

00:28:36,429 --> 00:28:41,690
specifically but I also think that we

00:28:38,899 --> 00:28:43,159
need to focus some energy around

00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:46,129
maintaining the third-party app

00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:47,539
ecosystem things like Django debug

00:28:46,129 --> 00:28:49,789
toolbar and all the things that the

00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:53,210
jazzman group takes care of how can we

00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:56,210
support them the I know personally

00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:58,609
almost every Django project I work on

00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:00,980
uses some number of third-party apps

00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:03,440
that aren't that our mine and aren't

00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:06,429
anybody as part of Django core how can

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:10,220
we help them could we have a fellow who

00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:12,350
focused on those issues looking for pull

00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,999
requests and small bug fixes and and be

00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,440
added as a maintainer across a lot of

00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:19,129
those projects and I think that's

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,359
something that we should explore yeah I

00:29:19,129 --> 00:29:21,499
totally agree with that like Django

00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:23,359
stands on the shoulders of its

00:29:21,499 --> 00:29:25,249
third-party apps in many cases and like

00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:27,169
we we claimed you batteries included but

00:29:25,249 --> 00:29:29,359
some of the batteries come in the form

00:29:27,169 --> 00:29:32,690
of the third-party apps having having

00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:34,309
like a better like you know it's bad

00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:35,690
enough for the Django core like those

00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:37,369
third-party maintainer is burn out even

00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,029
more easily than we do right it's often

00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:39,830
a store

00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:42,320
like those apps come and they get

00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:43,820
popular then as I know from personal

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:47,210
experience you get a deluge of feature

00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:49,039
in issue requests new sort of go to walk

00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:50,749
away and so it would be really nice to

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,330
see like not just maybe in front of like

00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:55,070
Django itself helping out a bit more

00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:56,359
actively in things that really help

00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:59,989
build our community in that sense as

00:29:56,359 --> 00:30:01,969
well so on that theme of so fellows is a

00:29:59,989 --> 00:30:04,159
is a concept we think other open-source

00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:05,840
projects it should steal from us what

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,279
are some of the ideas from other

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:14,149
open-source communities that we should

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:16,210
be adopting something that I've come

00:30:14,149 --> 00:30:20,179
across recently is that I've seen other

00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:23,809
communities to kind of like a diversity

00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:26,320
audit or an open source project health

00:30:23,809 --> 00:30:32,389
audit and we are making a lot of

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:36,049
progress naturally but I feel that if we

00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:39,169
could look at where we think we should

00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:42,409
be and where we are and find problem

00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:46,519
areas and maybe create a strategy that

00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:50,419
we might make more progress kind of what

00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:52,519
what gets measured changes yeah I I

00:30:50,419 --> 00:30:53,690
think one of the the great open-source

00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,919
communities out there that we could

00:30:53,690 --> 00:31:00,489
learn a little bit from is the Postgres

00:30:54,919 --> 00:31:03,669
community there is a a huge amount of

00:31:00,489 --> 00:31:06,799
large commercial enterprises that

00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:09,589
contribute whole people and money and

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:11,029
resources to the Postgres project and

00:31:09,589 --> 00:31:13,489
that's part of I think part of its

00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:16,399
success and the fact that it's not tied

00:31:13,489 --> 00:31:18,679
around one particular company means it's

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:20,989
very resilient if a company falls away

00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:22,820
or becomes a bad actor that doesn't harm

00:31:20,989 --> 00:31:26,440
the project as a whole I'd really love

00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:28,820
to see companies who are using django

00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:33,080
contribute more of their own staffs time

00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:35,179
or funds in general and and have some of

00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,249
these you know this Jenga is being used

00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:38,749
by lots and lots of people if there was

00:31:37,249 --> 00:31:39,979
a little more contribution back from

00:31:38,749 --> 00:31:44,269
some of these companies I think that

00:31:39,979 --> 00:31:46,999
would with the whole project I also

00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:48,710
think the idea of sort of expanding the

00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:50,450
concept of office hours might be useful

00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:51,560
so my first open source contributions

00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:54,470
were

00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:56,900
ever to Drupal which is the PSP project

00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:59,930
project and I literally learned how to

00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:01,340
use git for the first time while sitting

00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:04,310
on my former sister-in-law couch in

00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:05,960
Japan during Drupal office hours Drupal

00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:07,820
core office hours so they had a set of

00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,380
office hours and I think they still

00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:11,870
continue to do it was there's a certain

00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:13,460
period of time one per week I believe

00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:14,930
where there are people in the IRC

00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:17,000
channels available to help you learn how

00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:18,860
to learn how to make contributions to

00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,720
the core and I know that somebody I

00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:23,780
think I believe Mariota holds office

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,310
hours as far as Python core goes but so

00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,690
there are some of those things that are

00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:28,880
being done but sort of expanding efforts

00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:31,250
like that where a dedicated amount of

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,560
time is going to be set aside for the

00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:36,220
purpose of helping people become more

00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:40,100
involved in the project in various ways

00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:41,270
so um we've talked a lot about the

00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,770
Django community let's spend a little

00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:45,470
bit of time talking about the Janke

00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:47,330
Django framework itself so I'm

00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:49,340
interested in what are the big ideas for

00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:50,810
Django what are some ambitious projects

00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,580
that Django should take on next and I'm

00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:56,660
going to pick a speaker completely at

00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:58,880
random and point at Andrew if he has any

00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:00,740
thoughts on what the the next big

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,960
evolution of Django should look like I

00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:05,600
have many thoughts too much even for a

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,370
full hour panel I think this is one of

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,200
the things like if you seen a my talks

00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:12,110
at the past couple of years the end is

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,330
often what is Django right like my

00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:16,100
position is like Django has kind of

00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:17,360
achieved what its initial goal was which

00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,860
was to become this sort of good

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,240
framework that was designed for like

00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:22,010
from a newsroom environment initially

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,050
but like you know we had to work out

00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:26,270
what it is in future and like my

00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:28,520
personal like pet project these days is

00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:30,130
asynchronous stuff if you've not seen my

00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:32,330
blog post the plan is to take

00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:33,920
progressively more and more Django to be

00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:36,200
async capable so starting with the

00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:38,030
request path ending with the ORM being

00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,280
fully async capable and there's a lot of

00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:41,810
enhancements there as well there's other

00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:44,960
small things too we were talking this

00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:47,660
morning Simon about my sequel now has

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,240
great geospatial support and so there's

00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,980
a huge opportunity there for adding good

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,870
geo django support to the my sequel

00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:55,340
back-end and there's all sorts of good

00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:57,860
ideas like this that we need to just go

00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:00,530
and find one of the kind of problems is

00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:03,290
that many of us on the currently

00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:04,850
external core team are a little bit sort

00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,299
of all like low on the tooth should we

00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:08,389
say like

00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:10,760
okay we settled in our ways and I think

00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:13,579
we got dogs yeah like you walked without

00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,799
dogs I got I got too many hobbies but

00:34:13,579 --> 00:34:17,419
the point is that we need that injection

00:34:15,799 --> 00:34:20,240
of fresh talent as well to help bring

00:34:17,419 --> 00:34:22,520
those new ideas right but certainly in

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,700
the short term I think like if we want

00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:28,460
to be competitive on to use a phrase the

00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:30,169
world stage your frameworks I think

00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:32,149
looking at what everyone else is doing

00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:34,129
and like what people are turning towards

00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:38,179
things like node especially you'll go

00:34:34,129 --> 00:34:40,309
and like having a great fluid easy to

00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:41,720
use asynchronous story is for me one of

00:34:40,309 --> 00:34:42,559
those big ones like can we position

00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,169
django as

00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:47,210
oh no we're not only really experienced

00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:48,559
like well learn at framework but also we

00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,359
have all the shiny new things as well I

00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:52,399
think your powerful this reflects back

00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:54,799
to a sort of earlier earlier topic and

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:57,920
how do we make how do we take the

00:34:54,799 --> 00:35:00,109
lessons from our events a world in

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,880
inclusively and making lowering the

00:35:00,109 --> 00:35:03,829
barrier to entry for new developers how

00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:07,420
do we apply those to Django itself and

00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:11,750
that's an open question for the panel so

00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:13,339
one way that we open some stuff up in

00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:15,619
the last year or so that I don't think

00:35:13,339 --> 00:35:17,510
has maybe gotten as much news as maybe I

00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:19,339
should have tried to push for it but who

00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:21,799
here is a member of the Django Software

00:35:19,339 --> 00:35:24,140
Foundation did you know that the rest of

00:35:21,799 --> 00:35:25,549
you can't be too all you have to do is

00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,740
go fill out a web form and you can

00:35:25,549 --> 00:35:28,730
become a member and then you can vote on

00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:30,109
who gets to be in the board and

00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:31,640
participate in the discussions on these

00:35:30,109 --> 00:35:34,010
mailing lists it is not a high-traffic

00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:36,770
mailing list no one will come and beat

00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:39,559
you if you don't vote but so you know

00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:41,540
please come in and and join and and and

00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:43,250
start participating we can you know if

00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:45,410
we're all kind of on the same mailing

00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:46,549
list we can throw around ideas and and

00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:52,369
communicate a little better as a

00:35:46,549 --> 00:35:54,980
community any further thoughts on on

00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:57,740
lowering that barrier to entry well I

00:35:54,980 --> 00:36:01,130
liked what Carlton said earlier in his

00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:02,990
talk in in just his approach to it and

00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:05,510
and and trying to take away that

00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:08,660
pressure but like mentorship we had

00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:10,010
touched on earlier but just for myself

00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,630
too I guy I wouldn't feel comfortable

00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:13,250
and I know if people with ten years

00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:14,990
experience or whatever experience they

00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,880
might not feel comfortable so just like

00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:18,360
if you know somebody that would like to

00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,950
be interested or mention it or

00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:22,050
nudge right sometimes we just needed a

00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:24,180
little nudge in the right direction and

00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:26,310
then if there is interest kind of help

00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:28,890
them and and pull them up right to where

00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:30,030
you are if you're in you know a place

00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,380
where you can't help somebody I think

00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,850
that would definitely be helpful or if

00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,590
there was something more official that

00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:37,890
you know a program that would be even

00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:39,600
better but yeah actually I want to steal

00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:41,910
a phrase from Rachel from earlier today

00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,710
with regard to helping people meet their

00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:46,650
goals so if you're gonna have people

00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:48,330
making contributions to Django again

00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:49,620
let's be realistic the people who are

00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:51,300
gonna make contributions to Django are

00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:52,890
going to be people who use Django the

00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,480
people who use Django are going to be

00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:56,310
people who find that Django helps them

00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,810
do the things that they're wanting to do

00:36:56,310 --> 00:37:00,000
whether that has become professional

00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:01,890
software engineers or to just build web

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,530
applications that you know that are for

00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:06,770
their Boy Scout Troop or for their

00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:10,860
overwatch League team or for whatever

00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:11,940
but no bias there but the people who are

00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,920
going to actually contribute to Django

00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:17,400
went to people who actually use Django

00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,710
and so in your local communities your

00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,990
local Python and Django user groups if

00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:24,210
you can sort of make an effort to try to

00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:26,190
help draw more people in by showing them

00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:27,840
how Django can be useful to them it can

00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:29,190
be beneficial to them even if they're

00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,390
not planning to become professional

00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:33,990
software engineers

00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:35,550
if Django is useful to them those people

00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:37,680
become part of the community and that

00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:39,870
LARC that widens the pool of the

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,280
community and so the volunteers the

00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:42,450
contributors they want to come from that

00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,970
community who actually find use in

00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:51,480
Django so I think that would be very

00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:53,970
helpful let's talk about money so the

00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,800
Django jack so the oak took the question

00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:57,930
basically is who has money and who needs

00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,760
money and a Frank I'd love it if you

00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:02,160
could fill us in on how the Django

00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,610
funding ecosystem works at the moment so

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:08,070
I think by terms of who has the largest

00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:11,760
bank account I think the DSF wins out by

00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:13,530
a little bit and we we get our money

00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,210
mostly from corporate sponsorships and

00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:17,340
individual sponsorships and then the

00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:19,080
current pycharm promotion that's going

00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:23,610
on right now is a big source of our

00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:26,160
revenue each year I'm very confident

00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:29,610
that if we had some big projects to

00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:31,740
spend on we could go find the money but

00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:33,900
right now we don't have a lot of

00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:37,320
and we don't have a lot to go spend it

00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:38,700
on that makes sense to us and so if we

00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,290
had a reason I think we could go find

00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,630
the money and I think that if you know

00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:45,089
particularly on the reason I think we

00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:46,560
would know who to go target so if it was

00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:48,180
something async who would benefit from

00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,390
that as companies let's go reach out to

00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:54,540
them get $5,000 from 10 companies and

00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:55,650
we're off to the races so I think that

00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,300
that's you know and then we use that

00:38:55,650 --> 00:39:00,960
money for the fellows we use the money

00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:02,849
for sponsoring events and and we can use

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,810
that money for other things that the

00:39:02,849 --> 00:39:13,020
community dreams up anyone on the panel

00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:13,380
want to say that they need the money all

00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,839
right

00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,790
Oh answer on behalf first on behalf of

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:21,060
jungle girls is the fundraising

00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:24,990
coordinator jungle girls needs the money

00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:28,430
we need to support our infrastructure

00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:32,609
that enables us to give the resources

00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:35,270
our volunteers are using to organize the

00:39:32,609 --> 00:39:38,460
events support our online tutorials

00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:41,550
stuff like that so jungle girls does

00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:44,040
need the money then as well as address

00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:46,290
of director representing Africa we also

00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:49,109
need the money for our events in Africa

00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:52,619
so would really appreciate a sponsorship

00:39:49,109 --> 00:39:54,869
for our offense so yeah we need the

00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:57,830
money as jungle girls as well as Africa

00:39:54,869 --> 00:39:57,830
needs your money thank you

00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:07,260
I'm going to say from something with

00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:08,400
self several perspective that a definite

00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,230
adds a former definite board member

00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,970
definitely could use the money because

00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:13,830
one of the things in addition to putting

00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:16,290
on Django con which hopefully you all

00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:18,540
are enjoying definite is also working to

00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:21,210
promote Django related educational

00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,530
events throughout North America and one

00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:25,710
of the ways the definite does that is by

00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:26,730
providing grants to people who Andrew

00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:28,740
groups who are doing those sorts of

00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:30,210
events and so the more money that there

00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:32,160
is that is available to definitely the

00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:33,600
more more grants the definite is able to

00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,700
give or the larger those grants can

00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,590
become and that also makes it a little

00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,570
more viable for people to start thinking

00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:42,710
about having their own Django related

00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:48,000
events in the different localities okay

00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:50,520
words are hard I'm sorry so I'd like to

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,680
finish up by I'm inviting the board to

00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:54,690
to put out some calls to action like

00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,580
what are things that that we as members

00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:58,290
of the community what our actual action

00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,130
points we can be taking to address some

00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:01,260
of the issues that we've been

00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:02,970
discovering today and I'll do this to

00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:06,330
know in whatever order you like

00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:09,510
like I'll start then over here so my

00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:13,680
call to action is somewhat predictable

00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:16,320
but it is about having ideas right like

00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:19,410
right now we are on the precipice of

00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:21,840
opening up the Django what will become

00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:25,350
the former Django call to everyone else

00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:26,490
here and a lot of you use Django I love

00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:28,680
you Jang here more than I do in my job

00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:32,100
these days you have the ideas you have a

00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:34,170
knowledge and the next decade of Django

00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:36,540
is to be defined by the big ideas like

00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:38,670
we need to know like what we work on

00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:41,220
what what what high point should we aim

00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:43,140
for even if we do part of it or just so

00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:45,120
a smaller version of it we need that

00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:48,180
kind of input so like please come to

00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:49,590
sign up Django developers common

00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,720
suggesting ideas

00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:53,280
let us discuss them let's renew some of

00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:58,920
the energy and think about what those

00:41:53,280 --> 00:42:03,180
next that next decade holds for us for

00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:07,200
me appreciate if we could get members

00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:09,170
from the American community in all over

00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,420
the world joining our mailing list

00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:15,180
Python Africa so that you can meet other

00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:16,200
developers from Africa Maine rhodium

00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:19,200
hope them

00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:21,030
and if not on we don't appreciate just

00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,440
the mind we do appreciate the mind but

00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:25,710
we also appreciate the knowledge

00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:28,440
transfer that can happen if there's an

00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:30,230
interaction between Africa and the rest

00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,240
of the world so we really appreciate

00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:35,790
learning from you and if there's any way

00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:38,130
you can reach out to Africa and try and

00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:41,130
shed the knowledge that you have that go

00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:42,720
a long way in also ensuring that even

00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:47,040
the contributors to the jungle project

00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:49,890
itself is dead waste so we cannot just

00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:53,190
expect say we're opening it up to

00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:57,000
everyone index already accept accept

00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:59,100
expect that the contributors would be

00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,200
divest if you are not willing to help

00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:03,270
other people who need to learn and grow

00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,980
and then be able to contribute to the

00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:08,430
jungle framework so I think we need to

00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:10,560
be able to offer our time as mentors for

00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:12,450
knowledge transfer to ok so that we have

00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:16,440
this group of people contributing to

00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:18,000
jungle I think that joining the DSF

00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:20,430
membership and getting involved in the

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,710
community that in any way shape or form

00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:24,480
it doesn't have to be code most of my

00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:27,450
contributions to Django or not in the

00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,370
form of code and yours don't have to be

00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:30,960
either it can be like people have said

00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:32,910
mentoring to answering questions on

00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,120
mailing lists fixing typos and Docs

00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:37,440
adding Docs that can that Docs that

00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,700
confused you changing how they're

00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,560
written so that they're less confusing

00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:42,360
there's lots of ways to get involved you

00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,910
can volunteer at conferences to be a

00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:46,020
chair runner and session runner there's

00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:51,420
lots of ways to get involved and just

00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:52,950
help get involved if you see a person in

00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:55,170
our community especially an

00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:57,360
underrepresented person who could take

00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:59,450
on a leadership role and maybe for

00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:02,130
instance they don't think of themselves

00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:04,620
as being able to do that please

00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:08,790
encourage them to do that and mentor

00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:10,770
them if you're able to do it so - more

00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:11,940
like Generic I guess for the framework a

00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:13,400
couple years ago there was this joke

00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,660
that was kind of going around and

00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,350
basically was the idea of calling the

00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:20,430
framework boring please stop doing that

00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:21,720
essentially we have like thousands of

00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:22,890
attendees go through Django girls every

00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,330
year and they're really excited because

00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:25,590
I just learned something that's new and

00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:28,950
it's exciting and they're learning how

00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:29,730
to code and so I get that sometimes we

00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:31,080
some of us

00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:33,450
been here for a while we've been doing

00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:35,820
django and to us it's it you know if

00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:37,800
there's a joke of it's boring it's

00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,850
really dismissive to people like I think

00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,770
probably a third of our audience every

00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:42,660
year people who are new to Django

00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:44,310
it is exciting you're learning something

00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:46,340
new so I think you know setting that

00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:48,480
tone letting people know they're welcome

00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:51,990
let's just not be dismissive with that

00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:54,390
joke all right so as the North American

00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:57,359
ambassador I have specific assignments

00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:59,910
literally I'm gonna give a couple of

00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:01,560
examples here the idea is to starts

00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:03,540
trying to build bridges a lot of things

00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,950
that happen in Django are centered maybe

00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:07,830
in the US or in Europe and so we need to

00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:09,540
expand upon that so look at Mariana and

00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:12,869
point to her as an example of how it's

00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:15,450
being done right so high cascades a

00:45:12,869 --> 00:45:18,840
local conference that moves between

00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:20,609
Vancouver Seattle and hopefully Portland

00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,830
so that you've got Canada and the US

00:45:20,609 --> 00:45:24,510
interacting with each other I don't know

00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:26,760
if earnest is here but say Chicago

00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:28,859
Detroit Cleveland you all are

00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,240
responsible for Toronto and so I need I

00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:32,760
need Bridget to be booked between

00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:35,700
Toronto and Ontario so wherever you are

00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,560
from I'm in Texas in Houston Houston

00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:40,530
Dallas Austin we're responsible for

00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:43,020
mexico city guadalajara san diego you're

00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:45,990
responsible for tijuana so wherever you

00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:48,750
live go to Google Maps and just look at

00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:51,270
look and say what's a four to six hour

00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:52,710
drive from you and structure if its

00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:54,000
international then structure try to make

00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:55,830
connections there but even if it's not

00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,960
international so for instance PI Ohio

00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:59,670
and Columbus PI Tennessee in Nashville

00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,320
you all are responsible for Appalachia

00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:03,180
and making sure that there's more

00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:05,790
activity in those regions and then PI

00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:08,160
Ohio since PyCon is in Cleveland the

00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:09,840
less this year and next year start

00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,790
making those connections using their

00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,960
connections with Toronto and Ontario to

00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:16,080
spread some of that information from

00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,820
Toronto and Ontario into Appalachia and

00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:19,800
then when people from Texas come to PI

00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,880
Ohio on PI Tennessee we can share that

00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,490
with the folks in Mexico City in

00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,260
Guadalajara so and people on the east

00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:27,030
and west coasts west coast you're

00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:32,010
responsible for Asia east coast you're

00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:34,130
responsible for oh so nice so you get to

00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:34,130
it

00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:44,220
Caribbean also the Caribbean so Florida

00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:46,690
I'm gonna say most of the Gulf Coast

00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:48,549
we're responsible for the Caribbean but

00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:50,020
also if pie creamy and genuine in

00:46:48,549 --> 00:46:52,180
February if you live in the northern

00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:54,880
part of North America you want to go to

00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:57,059
the Caribbean in February so keep that

00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,059
in mind

00:46:57,299 --> 00:47:02,319
well along those those same lines also

00:47:00,579 --> 00:47:04,750
the whole thing about creating events

00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:07,270
local to whatever it is that you let you

00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:09,339
leave that's a really good idea but also

00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:12,490
if you don't have any idea on how to

00:47:09,339 --> 00:47:14,740
start or maybe you're just not sure if

00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:17,079
you want to do it or not you can come

00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:18,849
and talk to us that's also something

00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:20,319
that we do a definite and that's

00:47:18,849 --> 00:47:23,079
something that we want to do even more

00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:25,210
which is give you more information more

00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:26,740
details and guide you on how to do these

00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:29,680
things because we know that it's not

00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:31,869
easy but so the only thing is that we

00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,849
also need your feedback to see what is

00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:35,680
it what what's the information that's

00:47:33,849 --> 00:47:40,960
missing that it should be out there and

00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:43,569
any and it's not there I'm going to

00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,809
speak like general girls and what you

00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:50,619
can do to help us with the community

00:47:45,809 --> 00:47:52,119
money for your local events check I'm it

00:47:50,619 --> 00:47:53,650
were ninety four different countries and

00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:55,000
a ton of cities so check what there is

00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:56,819
if you don't have money or you don't

00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,849
want to give money give your time

00:47:56,819 --> 00:48:03,130
organize events be a coach you can do it

00:48:00,849 --> 00:48:06,029
we have organizers manuals online to

00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:09,329
follow so it's basically copy paste and

00:48:06,029 --> 00:48:12,460
also may help maintaining the tutorial

00:48:09,329 --> 00:48:16,180
and keep it up to date or translate it

00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:17,859
as I said earlier we need you well we're

00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:18,750
out of time so thank you very much to

00:48:17,859 --> 00:48:27,760
