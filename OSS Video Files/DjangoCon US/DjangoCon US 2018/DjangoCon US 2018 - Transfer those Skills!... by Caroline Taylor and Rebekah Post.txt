Description: 
	DjangoCon US 2018 - Transfer those Skills! How to Identify, Communicate, and Sell your Transferable Skills when Switching Careers by Caroline Taylor and Rebekah Post

Tech industry giants are acknowledging that diversity in employee backgrounds is valuable for their organizationsâ€™ bottom lines. However, itâ€™s still tough for job seekers to land a tech job without prior experience closely aligned with the job theyâ€™re applying for. This talk will focus on helping people who are looking for their next tech role: (1) understand themes of what hiring committees look for, (2) identify transferable skills from nontraditional experience they already have, (3) communicate the power of their unique set of past experiences, and (4) learn tools to demonstrate these skills in their resume and job interviews.

Attendees who are looking for their next role will leave with actionable ideas for improving job application materials, conveying transferable skills from non-technology-related jobs in interviews, and generally rocking any job interview with basic tips that many people miss.

The presenters, both of whom came to tech without a traditional CS background, will give a short introduction of their experience and expertise. They will discuss the aspects of their experience that they expected to be valuable from the start, and those (sometimes surprising!) skills whose value became apparent only after they got to technical positions. Both presenters have participated in hiring panels, one as a hiring manager.

They will share tips and tricks based on industry best practices and their experience reviewing resumes, cover letters, speaking with references, and interviewing job candidates. They will highlight common mistakes and things to consider when applying for, and then interviewing for, attendeesâ€™ next tech job.

of Harry Potter and friends to to find

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,110
this content come alive so I will say I

00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,209
feel obligated to tell you there may be

00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:11,430
spoilers in here so like if you haven't

00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:13,410
read or seen anything Harry Potter

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:17,280
related sorry in advance we figured it's

00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:19,980
been out for a while so so our alternate

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,170
title here is all about how to harness

00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,360
your magical powers so when we talk

00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,459
about transferable skills will be using

00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,350
magical powers interchangeably when

00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,630
talking about those skills and today

00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,610
we're really going to focus on jobs

00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:34,620
related to software development whether

00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:37,110
that's actually a developer or engineer

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,620
position or the related positions like

00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:42,209
testers QA product owners product

00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,910
managers these are all important things

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:48,330
but a lot of this vais advice honestly

00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:49,470
can be used for any type of field that

00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,950
you are interested in going into

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:55,380
absolutely so before we get into it

00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:58,200
let's have some introductions who are we

00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,930
as I mentioned Carol and I do not have

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,219
computer science degree

00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:07,430
is before I became a developer I did a

00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:08,930
lot of data analysis and in my first

00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,450
developer job I did a lot of data

00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:13,189
analysis as well but now my position is

00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:15,290
a lot more of a traditional coding

00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:17,900
position right and after I joined

00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:20,120
software development I went on to be a

00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,680
man ever to a manager position and I

00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,830
most recently transitioned to the

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,509
product team I've had a little over two

00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,070
years of hiring experience both as a

00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:30,770
hiring manager and as someone on a

00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:33,169
hiring committee yeah and I've been able

00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,240
to get a little bit of experience hiring

00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:37,310
as well reviewing resumes and helping

00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,050
with interviews which has been a really

00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,060
cool way to see how it works from both

00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,259
sides right so we want to share what

00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,570
we've learned in transitioning from

00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:47,090
career or maybe just different kinds of

00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:49,039
jobs in the same field to help you guys

00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,599
make that transition yourself and in

00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:53,120
order to give you guys the best advice

00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:55,789
possible we did a lot of research and we

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,530
also interviewed ten people with various

00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:58,520
roles in technology so we interview

00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,550
people who are who are software

00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:04,419
developers project managers dev managers

00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,470
even a CEO an HR professional

00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:08,030
organizational change management analyst

00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,530
we really tried to get a breadth of

00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,180
different experiences so we can share

00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:14,449
something useful with everyone here yeah

00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:16,550
we also went to the library to do some

00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:19,639
research right that we waited through

00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:22,520
some journal articles as well as a ton

00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:25,419
of internet articles good and bad to

00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:28,490
bring you hopefully what's helpful

00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:30,770
because we don't have a sorting hat to

00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,240
tell us what our future should be we had

00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,860
to go through all of this different

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,400
process and the first thing we're going

00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:40,909
to talk about them what does it take

00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,169
what does it take so here is just a

00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:43,729
brief outline of what we're talking

00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:44,990
about today to help you know where we're

00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:47,419
going so we're gonna talk about

00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,979
prioritizing networking we're gonna talk

00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:50,750
about focusing on the skills you bring

00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:52,669
to your next role and the skills that

00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,889
you need for that role we're gonna talk

00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:56,380
about how to craft your material so they

00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:58,820
really tell the story that you've lived

00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,409
we're gonna show you how to hustle for

00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,539
feedback to make sure you're improving

00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:04,009
all along the way we're gonna encourage

00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:06,259
you to get out there and ply that's an

00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:08,060
important step we'll have some tips are

00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:10,130
rockin the interview and then I want you

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,599
to keep on proving over and over it may

00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,400
not be that you get your dream job the

00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:13,330
first time you apply

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,340
right so we're gonna talk about how to

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,169
iterate and improve now I will say that

00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,030
these are not necessarily order bound so

00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:20,949
if we talk about something today that

00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:22,900
really inspires you to take action

00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:23,949
tomorrow do it you don't have to go in

00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,419
this order this is just how we'll be

00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:28,449
leading you through the content today

00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:32,050
yeah so as she mentioned let's talk

00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:33,960
first about networking to be honest when

00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:37,210
I thought about networking before

00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,650
preparing for this talk I it made me a

00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,760
little bit uncomfortable I didn't like

00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,020
the idea of it I didn't know what to

00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,180
think about it

00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:47,800
does anybody here really like networking

00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:52,120
a few people two or three who avoids

00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,680
networking a lot more willing to admit

00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,750
that and everybody else is somewhere in

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,810
the middle or just too shy to say all

00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:00,250
right so what I found in learning about

00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,870
different ways of networking is that

00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,539
there are so many different ways that I

00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,550
already was networking but in a way that

00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:08,860
I found comfortable and that fit my

00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,870
personality so we would encourage all of

00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,280
you to do the same to find a way that

00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:15,490
you can network that you can connect

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,830
with others within whatever technical

00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,650
area that you're in right and I think a

00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,270
lot of people approach networking as

00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:24,099
kind of a way to get something out of

00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,750
somebody it's very transactional in my

00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:28,030
experience and what I found to actually

00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,590
be really helpful for me you know I find

00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,810
those transactional interactions really

00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:33,280
awkward and uncomfortable as I find that

00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,820
if I approach it as I'm here to make

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,740
friends

00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,120
and it turns out people when I help

00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,349
their friends right and so if you

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,669
volunteered with somebody or worked with

00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:42,370
someone that you enjoyed working with

00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:44,770
you're more likely to recommend them for

00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,930
a job or find an opportunity and pass it

00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,639
along to them so I encourage you to make

00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,960
some friends here at Jango con because

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,389
you really you're 90% of the way there

00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,580
by showing up today and that it's gonna

00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:57,699
help you out yeah ooh one thing we also

00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:00,729
found out I just remembered one of the

00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:03,340
people that we interviewed for for this

00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:04,479
talk we asked her how she liked to do

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,770
networking cuz she's really good at it

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,539
she meets a lot of different people and

00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,070
what she recommended even though it

00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:12,490
sounds extra scary is to go to

00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:13,810
networking events alone which maybe it

00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,190
makes your skin crawl a little bit but

00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,510
she said what she found is that if she

00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,889
went with friends she was way more

00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,960
likely to talk to her friend and not

00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:21,669
make any new friends and so we encourage

00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,140
you to go to those events alone you're

00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:24,240
much more approachable and you're much

00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,919
more motivated to

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,050
talk to somebody that way yeah a great

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,810
idea so there are the traditional

00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:32,130
networking events but you can network at

00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,110
places where you're trying to do other

00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:37,200
things as well for example while

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:39,419
practicing a skill perhaps at a meet-up

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,180
maybe while you're volunteering or even

00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:44,730
at a hackathon and those are all ways to

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,680
gain experience but also get out in the

00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,899
community and network and meet people

00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,910
who live in your area who are working

00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:53,160
with the same sorts of things sort of

00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:54,899
like Dumbledore's Army where students

00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,430
from different houses right they all

00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,830
were practicing their skills together

00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:01,290
and making a different group of friends

00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,000
than they had before and we encourage

00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,200
you guys after today's talk to say hello

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,250
to your neighbor if you don't know them

00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:10,529
and make a new friend

00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:11,610
you'll be step one down awesome all

00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:13,680
right so the next step we'll talk about

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,120
is focusing on the skills and this is a

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,770
two-parter because really you want to

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,990
focus on what skills you bring to this

00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:21,959
next dream role and also what skills are

00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:24,750
really necessary so you may not think

00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:27,000
that you have the perfect resume hagrid

00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,890
is certainly didn't he ended up getting

00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,420
his dream job somewhere at near the end

00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:33,089
of the books of care of magical

00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,980
creatures instructor but as a Hogwarts

00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:37,560
student drop out and the grounds keeper

00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,600
on campus for several decades which we

00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,250
know is not a very prestigious job he

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,140
was really surprised to find that he

00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,370
actually had a lot of the experience

00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,579
that was necessary for being a great

00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:49,260
magical creatures instructor his

00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:51,240
background led him to his passion for

00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,620
magical creatures and in this case gave

00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,110
him that perfect opportunity with the

00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,760
help of Dumbledore the headmaster of

00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,770
Hogwarts yeah we also have a real-life

00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,740
example one of the people that we

00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:03,570
interviewed was recruited out of college

00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,980
that there were recruiters contacting

00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,329
him saying hey we want to hire you now

00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,670
and he's like well I don't I need my

00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:12,209
degree don't I need that for to get a

00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:15,060
good salary but in high school he had

00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:17,100
been making geo cities and Angelfire

00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,230
websites if you weren't on the internet

00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,630
at that time those are like the great

00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,910
granddaddy of Squarespace and WordPress

00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:26,100
things like that but what he found was

00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:29,520
that no he didn't need the degree in

00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:32,279
order to be hired so he decided to quit

00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,350
college went and took a job and ended up

00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:35,640
with a bunch of different jobs and now

00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,380
owns a company

00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,270
where he also does not care so much

00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:43,200
about what degree you have as much as

00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:45,120
the skills that you can bring so when

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,880
you're trying to figure out what unique

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,310
skills or magical powers you have you

00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:54,090
can think of Harry Potter's ability to

00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:55,890
speak to snakes he didn't even know what

00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:57,390
it was he didn't know what was happening

00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:00,180
when he spoke to the snake at the zoo

00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:01,950
one time but this is something that was

00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,960
really really hard if not impossible for

00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:06,330
others around him that for him came very

00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,470
naturally it was very easy so there may

00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,150
be something that's really hard for

00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,490
other people around you that's really

00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:13,830
easy for you that might be writing a

00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:16,530
very readable and accessible email it

00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,820
might be designing really beautiful

00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:20,400
architectures it might be always

00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:22,110
catching the details we encourage you to

00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,030
look for things that other people come

00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,080
to you for help with because chances are

00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:29,190
that means you're really good at that

00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:31,890
yeah I was shocked in my first developer

00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:34,650
role that people complimented me on my

00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:36,450
emails I'm like it's an email what's

00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:38,220
wrong with you but then they started

00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:41,340
asking me for help editing other things

00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,560
and also in my documentation like oh you

00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:46,080
had laid those steps out very clearly

00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,970
like well I would hope so that's a point

00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,890
but but it was something that was easy

00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:52,230
for me that I just didn't realize how

00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:54,720
much if like difficulty others might

00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,340
find in that area right and as a product

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,680
team member a big part of my job is

00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:00,240
figuring out what a user is struggling

00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,430
with and how can our developer team

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,230
really meet that need in a unique way or

00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,090
in a in a straightforward way and so a

00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,990
lot of my job is asking questions and

00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,820
trying to figure out what the right

00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,740
question to ask is and in my former

00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:13,200
career as an environmental educator I

00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,030
had asked a lot of questions of the 7 to

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,650
9 year olds that I worked with and I got

00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:18,390
really good at reading between the lines

00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:21,150
when they weren't telling me that they

00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:22,980
were scared of spiders okay and so you

00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:24,570
never know what job experience that you

00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,040
already have may be really valuable in

00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:29,400
your next career or your current one

00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:31,470
yeah so when you go looking for your

00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:34,380
magical powers the first thing to trust

00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:36,600
is your brain you know yourself and your

00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,490
experience is most of all your friends

00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,340
can be a good source maybe your favorite

00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:44,040
colleagues the experiences that you've

00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:46,200
had in life your favorite things to do

00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,500
because maybe you're not the best at it

00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,360
yet but if you

00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,740
doing something you're more likely to be

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,800
willing to put in the time to get better

00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,810
and if none of those are working for you

00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,400
you might also think about free skills

00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,950
assessments like they have a lot of

00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,980
these online where you can get an idea

00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:04,540
of what you might be good at right one

00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,370
of the people that we interviewed found

00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,770
her passion for organizational change

00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,450
management because she kept getting

00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:12,040
invited to these meetings where nothing

00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,870
about her job title indicated that she

00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,130
needed to be there but a lot of the

00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,650
developers were looking for help

00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:19,090
translating their lingo to members of

00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,890
the business and she was really good at

00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,660
that and so if you remember that you

00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:25,300
know important work flows to those who

00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,830
are competent getting that feedback from

00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,690
her colleagues and peers is really

00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:30,820
valuable and now she isn't a totally

00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:33,220
different job then she started with that

00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,900
she loves it yeah another example we

00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,850
have from our interviews is someone who

00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,650
was a project manager and realized that

00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,750
her favorite part of her job was writing

00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:42,960
macros and scripts in order to analyze

00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:45,160
different things and so she started

00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,050
taking on more coding like

00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,810
responsibilities and was able to

00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:52,020
transition to a developer role which was

00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:54,610
a really neat opportunity for her right

00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:56,680
now you don't have to listen to every

00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:59,230
piece of advice out there you may get

00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,000
feedback solicited or unsolicited from

00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:03,010
people you work with but you're not big

00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,420
fans of and you know what you don't have

00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,710
to take their advice just ignore them

00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,200
it's okay

00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,250
people if you you know really want to

00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,990
get some feedback on what you're really

00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:13,270
good at we encourage you to talk to nice

00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,589
friendly people who know your skills if

00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,720
you have that one friend that's really

00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:18,190
unnecessarily judgmental like you don't

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,020
ask them and if they give you a dice you

00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,240
don't listen to them in fact if you have

00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,470
any expert including us you know who

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,510
gives you advice that doesn't really

00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,589
work for your situation you don't do it

00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,570
because really you know your situation

00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:30,790
better so don't feel pigeon holed into

00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:32,530
doing this one thing and only this thing

00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:34,630
or else you can't get ahead right like

00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:37,240
the world is a wide bass place

00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:39,220
absolutely amazing and when we were

00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,080
looking at those internet articles there

00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,630
were tons of self-proclaimed experts

00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,860
contradicting each other so one expert

00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,120
might tell you one thing that's not

00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:48,220
going to work for you but you can just

00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:52,270
find another expert that will tell you

00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:53,440
something that might work for you okay

00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,660
so now we've talked about how to

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,940
identify what magical powers or

00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:59,770
transferable skills you have but what

00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,960
powers are actually really in demand for

00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:02,540
your

00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:06,530
dream role or industry it's time to look

00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:09,170
at some research yeah so luckily there

00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:12,680
is an organization that actually went

00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:14,720
and studied job ads across tons of

00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,970
different fields to figure out which

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,850
skills are common across different

00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:22,670
different areas and different different

00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:26,600
well just general fields and what they

00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:29,000
found was that there were 25 skills that

00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,790
stood out across the board and we have

00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,390
brought today the top 10 that they found

00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:37,040
in what they considered IT roles so that

00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,330
might go from customer service all the

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,480
way up to manager but it's still

00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:44,270
generally related these are in order of

00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,840
their findings the first most important

00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:50,080
is communication than writing

00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:54,310
organizational skills problem-solving

00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:57,110
planning project management research

00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:59,810
Microsoft Word and Office customer

00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:01,310
service and Microsoft Excel and when you

00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:03,200
see them up there you might be like yeah

00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,610
I guess I used those but how would I

00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,370
transfer that from somewhere else well I

00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:09,350
wrote a dissertation it's over 200 pages

00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:11,870
of writing so that checks that went off

00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:14,990
but also that was at the end of a

00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:18,050
three-year project that was a research

00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:20,870
project that covered two different

00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:23,330
countries organizing with 40 different

00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:25,250
participants two translators five

00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:27,620
professors and if anybody's worked with

00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,300
faculty you will know how impossible it

00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,980
is to get them to do anything so there's

00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,860
a lot of project management planning and

00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:36,770
problem solving that went into that yeah

00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,960
and my prayer career as environmental

00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:40,610
educator there was a about a year-long

00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,260
period where we were giving different

00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,730
curriculum every two weeks to different

00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,950
groups of kids and we had a team of

00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:48,680
seven and so that required a lot of

00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:50,840
close-knit direct communication a lot of

00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,730
project management and a lot of planning

00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,890
and honestly a lot of very last-minute

00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,690
creative problem-solving you probably

00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,520
have a lot of these skills already and I

00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:01,280
think what's really important in this

00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:03,650
study is that it shows that these skills

00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,560
are ones that are very well represented

00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:08,449
in job postings so it means that a lot

00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,040
of people don't necessarily have these

00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:11,829
skills but employers really want them

00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,329
and so if you do have these skills

00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:14,919
or you know baseline of transferable

00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:16,149
skills it's really important to

00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:18,579
highlight those in your next job search

00:17:16,149 --> 00:17:20,319
because you may have that leg up that

00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,089
someone doesn't and honestly if you've

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,159
been a part of hiring you know that you

00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:26,140
can teach technical skills to someone

00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:27,309
with that kind of brain and aptitude but

00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,720
it's really a lot harder to teach

00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:30,340
someone communication skills that

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,440
struggles with that so keep in mind that

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,840
these are really valuable in IT and

00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,269
these were found these were one in four

00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:41,700
of the skills found in the even the IT

00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:44,289
job ads so 25% that's pretty good yeah

00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,029
we will have a link to the actual study

00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:48,039
if you're interested in learning more in

00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:51,760
our github resource page that's interest

00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:55,000
listed at the end ok so you know what

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,649
skills are needed in IT in general but

00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,269
your dream job may not be necessarily

00:17:56,649 --> 00:17:59,529
made up of just transferable skills

00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:01,720
there may be some skills that are really

00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:03,779
unique to that kind of role that you

00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:06,730
need to make sure that you brush up on

00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:08,740
one way to find those out is a great

00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,000
piece of advice that someone told me at

00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,799
a networking event a couple years ago

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,539
this woman said she was looking to get

00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,429
into a new industry she didn't know a

00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:17,440
lot about what kind of job she wanted

00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:18,909
but she knew where she wanted to go like

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,340
the industry itself and so she looked at

00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:23,799
several job postings across the industry

00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,360
and she cut and paste those into her

00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:27,159
dream role and then she went to

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,710
networking events for that industry and

00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:31,000
said does this job exist I think it's

00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,200
called this as that right and people

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,700
with that industry knowledge are able to

00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,899
say actually no you don't want to go for

00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,460
this job you actually want to go this

00:18:34,899 --> 00:18:38,169
direction and she's able to get that

00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,659
feedback and really hone her job search

00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:43,210
very appropriately yeah and that sounds

00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:45,309
pretty amazing if you don't want to go

00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:47,260
up to real people you can also start out

00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:50,110
by looking at existing resumes on

00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:52,120
LinkedIn and indeed the indeed resume

00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:54,010
search is like typically for employers

00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,409
looking for employees but you don't have

00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:58,389
to have an account to to go and look at

00:18:56,409 --> 00:19:01,059
the existing resumes you can type in a

00:18:58,389 --> 00:19:03,190
couple of skills and say I would like to

00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:04,870
be a project manager and you can see

00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:06,519
people who have that listed as one of

00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:08,049
their past jobs and you can see that the

00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:09,760
skills that they've listed or you can

00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:11,470
see people who are now a project manager

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,149
and see what jobs they've had in the

00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:15,130
past and what sort of skills they'll

00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:16,750
show on their resumes that may have

00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,789
helped them to get that project manager

00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:21,370
position so that's a way that you can

00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:23,950
ease into it and that's indeed right

00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:26,130
yeah yeah use it it's out there

00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:28,270
after putting together all of these

00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:30,160
different things you may realize that

00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:32,890
you need some more experience before you

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,750
can get that dream job if that happens

00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:37,990
to be the case for you we do have some

00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:40,390
ideas these are more for developer type

00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:42,190
jobs but there are some others that can

00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:44,680
use them as well but the first would be

00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:46,990
to contribute to open source projects

00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,790
for example the Sprint's at the end of

00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:51,820
this week right Thursday and Friday

00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:53,830
you can work together with people who

00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,390
are really excited to have others work

00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:57,670
on them work on their open source

00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:59,710
projects last year I helped with one I

00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:02,680
had never used github before I had done

00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:04,420
a tutorial but they helped me to be able

00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,860
to figure out how to fork the repo how

00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:08,940
to make changes how to commit the

00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:11,830
changes how to fix when I screwed it up

00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,780
and they were super welcoming and

00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:16,540
helpful and I was I was actually able to

00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:18,130
commit something useful to an

00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,890
open-source project by the end of

00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:23,290
Thursday I was really into siding and we

00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:24,280
also heard from the organizers that if

00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,230
you want to participate in those

00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,700
Sprint's sign up by the end of Tuesday

00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:29,680
or by Wednesday morning or else you

00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:33,850
might not get food but do it that's

00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:35,560
probably a joke but still do yes so you

00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:37,600
can also create personal projects

00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,670
someone that we interviewed suggested

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,980
that even if you're if you want to be a

00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:46,450
sysadmin maybe you get a Raspberry Pi

00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:49,240
and configure it to monitor the output

00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:51,490
of ice in your freezer something that

00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,980
shows that you actually have some idea

00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:56,620
of what this job is going to take and

00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:58,060
have taken the initiative to go out

00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,050
there and try it out for yourself

00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,430
because when you're trying it for

00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,140
yourself you're gonna learn a lot more

00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:03,130
than when you're just going through a

00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,650
tutorial

00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:07,270
another option is short term gigs you

00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:09,640
can find those on different websites and

00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:11,830
such hackathons can be a great way to

00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,170
get little bits of experience I got to

00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:17,230
help redo a website for a non-profit

00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:19,780
which was amazing and I also learned

00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:22,600
about WordPress that weekend yeah

00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:24,250
sharing your work you know maybe you'll

00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,150
be more motivated to do more work if

00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,610
you're sharing it and of course

00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,960
volunteering you might ask the people

00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,760
you're volunteering what's ahead of time

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,620
if you can include that work in your

00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,480
portfolio but that can be a good way to

00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,640
get experience as well great and I hear

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,000
that the jingo kind or

00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:41,310
as well get a lot of networking and

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,660
experience organizing django con yes it

00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:47,970
or that next year yeah yeah okay so you

00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:50,070
know what skills you've got you know how

00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:52,140
they apply to this new job now it's time

00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:54,600
to craft your materials and really let

00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,800
that story of where you've been and how

00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,170
you're gonna get to where you're going

00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,300
shines through and it's important to

00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:02,130
craft your materials in such a way that

00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,630
it's really obvious to the hiring

00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,940
committees exactly why you're applying

00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:10,890
to this job and and why they should hire

00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:14,790
you so you don't have to be sleazy or

00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:18,330
lie on your materials like our skeezy

00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:19,440
colonists rita skeeter here but one

00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:22,110
thing that we found when we were doing

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,900
our research is that recruiters only

00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:26,640
spend on average six seconds on their

00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,410
initial pass of your resume

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,450
that's recruiters not necessarily

00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:32,250
everyone who looks the resumes right but

00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:35,400
oh my gosh that's shocking right like if

00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,510
you had against a lot of words or you

00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,790
don't have the most relevant experience

00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,990
up at the top or they have to really

00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:42,090
think about why you're applying for this

00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:43,710
job then you might lose that opportunity

00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:45,630
to work or you know to work with that

00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:47,370
fabric Reuter so we're gonna leverage

00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,690
some of rita skeeter strengths when

00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:50,450
we're building our materials next time

00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:52,830
right we're gonna include some

00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:54,450
attention-grabbing details we're gonna

00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:56,280
make it really clear how our past

00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:58,080
experiences apply to the job we're

00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,060
shooting for it now and we're also gonna

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,470
work really hard to be concise because

00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:03,390
when they're glancing over your resume

00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:05,280
or your cover letter you don't want to

00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:07,020
make them read extra words right they

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,560
only have a few seconds make every

00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,080
second count

00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,790
absolutely so none of the people that we

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,680
interviewed had a computer science

00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:19,230
degree and so they each had to tell how

00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:21,390
their unique story prepared them for the

00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:23,940
job that they currently have Caroline

00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:26,010
you are now a senior product owner and

00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,400
it's correct you were never a junior

00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:32,640
product owner it's not don't tell them

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,920
they won't see this so how did you

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,200
communicate to the company that you're

00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,240
now at that you had the skills and

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,980
abilities that they needed without ever

00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,950
having that role before I'm so glad you

00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:46,230
asked it's like we planned this well so

00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:48,460
I came to that interview at TransUnion

00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:50,680
armed with the certification and agile

00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,360
from product ownership I found out about

00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,100
that role for the first time when

00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,140
getting a certification as an agile

00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,070
scrum master and I found out about the

00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,180
product owner role and I was like

00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,860
actually that sounds like we weren't fun

00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:02,310
and so I immediately went in for that

00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:04,930
certification after that first one and

00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:06,460
and so that showed that I was really

00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:08,710
serious about the role right I wasn't

00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:10,150
just applying too many jobs over and

00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:12,010
over I was saying no I really want to be

00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:13,750
a product owner and a scrum framework

00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:16,180
and this is the role that I you know I

00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:18,130
want to take on and in that interview I

00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:20,290
was able to show that in jobs that I'd

00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:23,320
had previously I already had to learn

00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:25,030
and I had shown you know productivity

00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,670
and the skills that are required for

00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:29,770
product ownership and so as someone who

00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:32,890
was training people to become software

00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:35,020
developers I had to communicate non-tech

00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:36,460
communicate very technical information

00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,900
to people without a technical background

00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:39,220
because in the software developer

00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,660
training program that Rebecca and I came

00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:42,520
through you didn't have to have any

00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:46,630
developer experience before you you

00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:48,310
joined that program and after that is an

00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:51,040
organizational change management analyst

00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:52,090
a big part of my job was communicating

00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,610
between the technical and non-technical

00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:56,800
folks at UT at the University of Texas

00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:57,970
at Austin and so I had to do a lot of

00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,680
that translation that really is the

00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:02,290
hallmark of being a product owner that I

00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:04,960
do today and as a manager in my last

00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:07,360
role I had to show or you know I had the

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,890
opportunity rather to inspire people to

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,420
move in the same direction toward a

00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:12,340
common goal which again is so much a

00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,990
part of what a product owner does so I

00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:16,480
was able to weave that story among those

00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:17,980
very disparate roles in such a way that

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,300
it made it really clear that I could do

00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,130
the job even though I never had been a

00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:23,050
product owner before but you knew what

00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:24,370
it meant you were ready right and I will

00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:26,320
say too that I had applied to a

00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:28,240
half-dozen places around Austin Texas

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,230
where I live before I'm getting an

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,290
interview with this place and I never

00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:34,450
got a call back and and I knew someone

00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:36,100
at this organization and I think that he

00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,510
was able to advocate for you know let's

00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,920
just interviewer she hasn't had the role

00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:40,300
before but I know she has the skills

00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,550
right and so I think that speaks to the

00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:44,710
power of making friends at things like

00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:45,960
networking events and and leveraging

00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:49,420
those in the future in your job search

00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:51,280
definitely so once you have an idea of

00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:53,440
what you want to say you've got to get

00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,970
them down on that resume the resume is

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,830
the main way that you will share your

00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:59,280
story with that hiring committee right

00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:01,740
they might never get past a resume if

00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:04,050
it's unclear or doesn't have the details

00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,670
that they're looking for right the main

00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:08,520
advice that we found from a variety of

00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:11,940
sources is to keep it short use clear

00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:15,540
words use industry standard terms enlist

00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:17,610
a good editor pair your content down for

00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:21,750
relevance and consider the visual real

00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:24,000
estate and these are important across a

00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:26,220
lot of different sources that we found

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,540
even sources that conflicted on

00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,090
different things right

00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:31,350
there were some that said I would never

00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:33,210
read a resume with an objective

00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:35,340
statement and someone else would say I

00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:37,350
would never read a resume without an

00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,940
objective statement right so there are

00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:40,620
some roller things about summaries and

00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:43,140
so there are different aspects of

00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:45,600
resumes that you can't win with

00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,860
everybody on but these we generally

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,050
found basically everywhere that we

00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:50,370
looked right and again you know someone

00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:52,230
only has six seconds to review your

00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:54,210
resume again not everyone does but if

00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,500
recruiter is looking at your resume you

00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:58,170
want to make sure that it's really

00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,420
concise really easy for them to see what

00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:02,370
exactly is relevant and I like this idea

00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:04,590
of enlisting a good editor I always find

00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:06,180
someone who's never had a job that I'm

00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:08,280
moving toward or that I've had to help

00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:10,110
me find that jargon because like I can

00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,490
say ocm all day long but if nobody knows

00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:15,030
that that's organizational change

00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:17,190
management or with them why hire me up

00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:18,420
you know so you want to make it and you

00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:20,040
don't want them make the hiring

00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:26,220
committee think too hard you want to

00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:30,300
make it really easy yeah so let's use a

00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:31,980
real example that's me I was an

00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,800
instructor at the university level for

00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,900
six years and on my first resume that I

00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,480
used to to get into a training program

00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,970
for tech I talked about those daily

00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:45,270
everyday things that I did in my job and

00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:48,150
those were real things that I did but I

00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:53,190
also missed out on a huge opportunity to

00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:55,020
show a transferable skill which was that

00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:57,030
I presented complex technical

00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:59,370
information to a range of audiences

00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:01,770
tailored to the background and goals of

00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:04,650
the audience and that's what mattered

00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:08,310
that's what helped me go from teaching

00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:10,530
to presenting or leading a code review

00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:12,800
right and I bet so many of those

00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:14,870
experiences prepared you for

00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,430
that great documentation designing good

00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:19,460
workflows and writing maintainable code

00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:21,280
right try to give directions to 18 year

00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:24,710
olds who don't feel like being a man

00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:27,260
yeah once you've got your great resume

00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:30,200
you're probably gonna want to share it

00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:32,330
right for better or worse LinkedIn is a

00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,160
huge place for sharing your resumes it's

00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:35,600
a huge place for networking in tech if

00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,790
you don't want to be on it then you can

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,700
still avoid it yes but even recruiters

00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:42,920
are often advised to look for people on

00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,930
LinkedIn so if you want to be found by a

00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,490
recruiter you should probably put some

00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:48,170
stuff on there

00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,880
you might want to make sure your github

00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:52,280
stuff is up-to-date if you do things

00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,050
with open source and indeed is the

00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,910
largest job search in the world so you

00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:57,590
could put your resume there as well in

00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:59,510
order to be seen if you're interested in

00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:01,130
that right and if you do have an online

00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:03,110
presence we encourage you to make it as

00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:04,640
consistent as possible because chances

00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:06,050
are if they found you on LinkedIn and

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,460
they see a github page they're gonna go

00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:09,080
to that github page and if it hasn't

00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,910
been updated in four years they might

00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,680
notice in fact didn't you get a

00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:14,810
recruiter ask you when you finish your

00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,400
dissertation yeah a few months ago

00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:17,420
somebody's talking to me I think it's

00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,920
interesting to see what they have to say

00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,150
I wasn't interested in their job I'm

00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,040
like oh yeah and they're like and when

00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:24,740
are you when are you finishing your your

00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:26,840
PhD I'm like excuse me like well it says

00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,790
to present I'm like oh no or did you

00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:31,630
find that I finished that three years

00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:34,750
ago so oops

00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:36,770
so learn from our mistakes yes please

00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:39,080
all right so next we're gonna talk about

00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:42,170
the fun part right everyone's favorite

00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:46,100
part asking for feedback that was a joke

00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:47,810
you can laugh it's like we all get what

00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,980
we might call like term-paper syndrome

00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,870
where we've been staring at something

00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,940
for two hours or three days or a week

00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:55,150
and we think it's great and then someone

00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:58,070
in walks in and goes you missed a comma

00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:59,780
right or something really glaring that

00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:02,120
you would have seen if you taken a break

00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:03,800
and so asking for feedback will

00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,300
literally only ever help you right as

00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:09,320
long as you ask nice friendly people

00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:11,480
Yeah right and unfortunately you don't

00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:15,550
have a professor available to grade you

00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:17,570
unfortunately unfortunately oh sorry

00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:20,960
sometimes it's nice to know who to ask

00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:22,400
but you can ask friends some friends

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,230
maybe better than others about asking

00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,540
this kind of thing

00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:28,510
you may have co-workers who are willing

00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:29,980
to look over your resume who maybe have

00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:32,320
done some interviewing and could

00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:34,480
practice some questions with you if you

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,340
want to enlist a career coach some

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,470
people find those super helpful because

00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:40,870
it's somebody who really is objective

00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:43,030
and doesn't know you at all and so all

00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:45,370
of those can be options for ways to find

00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:47,140
feedback right and if you are contacted

00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:49,480
by a recruiter go ahead and ask them

00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,770
what drew you to my resume is there

00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,240
anything that you have questions about

00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:53,500
or might be confusing right that's a

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,570
great time to ask for feedback because

00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,070
again they don't know you they they may

00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:58,510
want to flatter you to get you into this

00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:00,100
new job but you can always ask for that

00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:02,290
feedback then you might be surprised and

00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,940
what helpful information you get if you

00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:05,799
go to a hackathon which I know I'm sure

00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:07,270
many of you have been to you go ahead

00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:08,919
and ask the group at the end for a

00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:10,660
retrospective maybe you can identify

00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:11,950
what went really well what could have

00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:15,190
gone better next time you do a hackathon

00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:16,840
maybe even ask for everyone to identify

00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:18,549
a top strength than someone else and get

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,110
that that feedback from your peers about

00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:21,580
what might be your actual magical power

00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:23,410
right and that doesn't have to be

00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:26,020
focused just on you you can start it off

00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:28,299
by being like Caroline thanks so much

00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:30,700
for keeping things moving along on

00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:35,710
schedule and having us have a Content

00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:37,090
freeze on that but for example my first

00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:39,220
hackathon that I went to was only a

00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:41,410
couple months after I got into my first

00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,940
developer role and I knew that I was not

00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:45,520
going to be able to code well enough to

00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:47,890
really help them with whatever they were

00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:52,030
doing that weekend so I was looking for

00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:54,610
ways to just be helpful and so I instead

00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:56,260
of trying to ask the developers how to

00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:58,570
do what they were doing and probably

00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:00,429
would have slowed them down I just asked

00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:01,990
them what they were doing and what the

00:32:00,429 --> 00:32:04,510
websites were for that and I started

00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:06,400
compiling the documentation because I

00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:08,260
was able to understand what they were

00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,000
working on but the person with the idea

00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:12,910
that we were executing for the hackathon

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,530
was in marketing she had no idea what

00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:16,390
any of it meant she had no idea what

00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:18,460
information would be needed if people

00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:21,370
were going to continue on it after that

00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:23,679
weekend and the developers were there

00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:25,630
because they wanted to write new code

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,330
they weren't there to document it and so

00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:29,919
I was able to fill in that gap and at

00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:31,840
the end of the weekend when I said you

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,780
know thanks for helping me find a way to

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,010
be involved the person who was sort of

00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,440
leading it was like what are you talking

00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:38,360
about you

00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,610
found on yourself so I didn't even

00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,020
realize it ran I remember when we talked

00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:44,030
about this in the past or Becca told me

00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:46,040
that she got so many kudos and very

00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:47,330
specific things right they made it clear

00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:50,090
like oh I'm actually really good at

00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:53,650
documentation yeah yeah it's not

00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:55,490
exciting still though still not fun yeah

00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:58,100
okay so you've got some beautiful

00:32:55,490 --> 00:33:00,110
materials they're cohesive they tell the

00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:02,450
story that you've lived now it's time to

00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:04,850
get out there and apply when you're

00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:07,880
applying it might set feel like you're

00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:08,960
just sending tons of letters to who

00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,910
knows where you don't know if they're

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:15,020
gonna be opened or thrown away or burned

00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:16,580
or whatever but at some point someone is

00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:19,490
going to be looking at those resumes

00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:21,500
right now studies that we happen to

00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:24,260
cross told us that even perfectly

00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:26,330
qualified candidates only get contacted

00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:28,130
in response to their application 8 to 15

00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:29,420
percent of the time that's not even a

00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:31,820
job offer that's just a first contact

00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:33,380
range and so I don't know about you but

00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,480
I've applied to jobs before and been

00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:38,300
really dissing heartened at how few

00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,340
callbacks I get so I guess the point of

00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:42,110
me saying that is it's not just you even

00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,400
if you're perfectly qualified you may

00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:45,830
not get a lot of callbacks and that's

00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,480
where networking really comes in - to

00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:49,730
help you out right know someone at that

00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,800
organization you may be more likely to

00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:53,630
be at least invited to an interview for

00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,700
better or worse yeah and because they're

00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:57,230
sending out so many as well the HR

00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,230
professional that we spoke with said

00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:02,240
that as long as your job search is

00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:04,040
fairly focused on one type of position

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,200
you do not need to tailor your resume

00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:08,150
for every single position if you want to

00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,010
be a Java developer then write a good

00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:11,870
resume for a Java developer and go with

00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:13,520
it if you want to be in Django write

00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:15,110
that Django resume and go with it

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,690
of course if you're going to send a

00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:20,720
cover letter be sure to tailor your

00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:22,820
cover letter at my organization we did

00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,910
recently get someone applying for

00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:27,460
somewhere completely different and that

00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:31,100
was set aside

00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:32,300
okay so you've applied and you get

00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,580
invited to the interview it's time at

00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,860
Arak the interview heck yeah how do we

00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,870
do that well if you've ever been on a

00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:40,190
hiring committee then you know that

00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:43,700
there are some real myths out there that

00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:44,960
trip people up unnecessarily so and we

00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,850
wanted to address some of those myths so

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,520
do hiring committees want someone who

00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:49,669
says

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:53,100
the right words and all the right orders

00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:55,590
no you're allowed to say um if you need

00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:57,600
them to repeat a question that's okay we

00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:58,920
all know that you're nervous probably so

00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,640
don't worry about getting everything

00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:04,470
perfectly we're all humans do we want to

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,790
hire someone who thinks they know more

00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:09,630
about the job than the hiring committee

00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:10,230
no you don't know more but you can't

00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,730
show that you've done your homework

00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:14,730
right there's a difference please do

00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:16,290
please do do they want to hire someone

00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:18,240
who thinks that they're perfect no

00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:20,310
because we're humans and everyone has a

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,960
room to grow and so you know being

00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:23,520
confident but also humble I think goes a

00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,020
long way for hiring committees and we

00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,030
really have seen these in interviews oh

00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,440
my gosh and also I'll say on that last

00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,790
slide that no one wants to hire someone

00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:35,430
that's gonna fire someone else in their

00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:37,590
first year Professor Umbridge the hiring

00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:39,150
committees do look for a lot of things

00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:40,470
that are similar across all kinds of

00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,940
roles so they want someone who's gonna

00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:44,070
be a team player because we know that

00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,540
software development and the the roles

00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:47,280
that support it really does require a

00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,630
lot of teamwork they want someone who

00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,490
enjoys problem-solving because at the

00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:52,260
end of the day every role in IT or in

00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:54,180
software development is there to solve a

00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,260
problem creatively they want someone who

00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,390
can accept feedback because remember

00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:59,490
you're not perfect although we love you

00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:01,080
anyway you need to be able to accept

00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,780
feedback so you can grow in your career

00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:05,370
they also want to imagine being able to

00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,800
work with you for years to come right

00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:09,810
and if you're not sure about these

00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,460
things if you're not convinced by us

00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:14,040
telling you about how hiring committees

00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,500
feel see if you can get on a hiring

00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,090
committee where we each work we're lucky

00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,550
that we've been able to help review

00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:22,410
resumes or help in interviews and I

00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:24,390
realize that not all organizations are

00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:27,660
open to that but you may be able to ask

00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:29,280
to observe an interview that you know

00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:31,350
you're just interested in how the

00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,480
process of picking a team member happens

00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:35,940
right you care about your team so that

00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,380
that's a reasonable request right and it

00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,390
really does shift your perspective if

00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:41,010
you've only been on the applicant side

00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:42,270
of the table you know a lot of those

00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:43,860
miss you don't know which ones are real

00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:45,210
and which ones are fake but once you've

00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:47,130
been in a couple interviews on the other

00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:49,380
side or at least observed them you can

00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:51,240
see that it really isn't something to be

00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:55,350
so freaked out about right or oftentimes

00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:56,850
it isn't definitely so even once you've

00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:59,160
gone to an interview if you're crazy

00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:00,030
lucky like all of Harry Potter's near

00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,240
brushes with that

00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:05,010
you will get an interview and then get a

00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,930
job from that first interview but for

00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:09,960
most of us we have to do it multiple

00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:11,490
times and you're probably your first job

00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,580
probably isn't gonna be your only job

00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:16,740
especially in tech right so most of us

00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:19,320
we need to keep improving all along the

00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:22,200
way as we go through this at some point

00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:25,500
you will get a job offer and when you do

00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:28,260
you should be sure to negotiate last

00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:31,440
year one of the django con keynotes was

00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:33,090
Tracy Osborn she gave a fabulous talk

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,070
that included the importance of

00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:37,320
negotiating and we would encourage all

00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:40,140
of you to go to youtube and look it up

00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:43,080
because it was great and several people

00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:44,640
that I know have used her tips which is

00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:48,110
true of all the talks of Django Khan you

00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,110
can find hours on YouTube later as well

00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:53,190
all right so the point again of today's

00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:55,260
talk is to really own the magical powers

00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:56,670
that you bring to the table we talked

00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:59,130
about networking and how to prioritize

00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:00,480
that early and often talked about what

00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:02,460
skills you bring to the table and what

00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,210
skills you should be building in your

00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,220
job search

00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:07,290
talked about how to craft your materials

00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:09,780
hustle for feedback actually apply to

00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:11,520
those jobs and how to rock the interview

00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:13,920
and again we encourage you to keep on

00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,260
improving along the way and if you don't

00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,700
mind let your network of friends know

00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:24,110
what works for you and what didn't yeah

00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:24,110
so thank you all very much

00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,100
my question to you guys is you guys have

00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:33,600
a good ass like like why you're applying

00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:36,330
for this new skill set when you have the

00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,020
old skill set that you were from and

00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:38,430
like how do you answer that question

00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:40,560
like oh we know that you come from

00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:44,190
background of this like why are you

00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:47,280
applying to absolutely my current job

00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:49,680
they asked me why you have a PhD in

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,170
French why on earth should we hire you

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,270
for identity manager lean or Mille Oh

00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:58,050
doesn't everybody I know like six people

00:38:54,270 --> 00:39:00,900
who did that anyway but the what I've

00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:03,600
said is that for me particularly it was

00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:05,490
sort of easy but because I can say the

00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,960
lifestyle that I'm looking for and the

00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:09,330
job opportunities that I'm looking for

00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,830
weren't with that old if you're looking

00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:12,180
for just a different skill set then it

00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:15,000
might be a little bit harder but you can

00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:17,070
say you know that this is what I am most

00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,720
interested in I've found you know I had

00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:19,860
the opportunity to work with this or

00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,240
through a hackathon or through a

00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:24,150
personal project I've been learning more

00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:26,670
about that and I found that that is

00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:29,580
really more compelling to me and my work

00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:32,430
style than whatever old tool set you are

00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:35,070
using before and at least in my

00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:37,050
experience that has been taken fairly

00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:39,630
well it seems right and I would add that

00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:41,820
as a hiring manager a lot of times that

00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:43,890
question is to learn more about you just

00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,660
as a person and as a contributor to an

00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:48,630
organization but I think a lot of times

00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:50,850
that's a question to identify any red

00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:52,380
flags so if you say that you're leaving

00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:53,520
your last job because you hated everyone

00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:55,650
there and they were all out to get you

00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,960
then that's a that's a red flag for me

00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:59,280
that is this person professionally

00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,720
mature enough to be successful in my

00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,520
organization right and so I would

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,170
encourage you to be honest and authentic

00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,640
with whatever the reason is maybe you're

00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:07,890
looking for something that better suits

00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,210
your work style or maybe you just really

00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:10,410
love the idea of being a product owner

00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:12,720
like I did I just

00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:15,180
I found that role exists and I wanted to

00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,130
have it so whatever is true for you just

00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:19,560
make sure you frame it as professional

00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:21,600
blight as you can can we give Rebecca

00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:24,110
and Caroline a big thank you very much

00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,110
it's super

00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:28,480
[Applause]

00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,480
