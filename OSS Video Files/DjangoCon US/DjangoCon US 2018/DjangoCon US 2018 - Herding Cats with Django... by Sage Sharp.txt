Description: 
	DjangoCon US 2018 - Herding Cats with Django: Technical and social tools to incentivize participation by Sage Sharp

This talk will provide a practical look at how Outreachy used a combination of technical and social tools to motivate participants to complete our internship application process. Web developers who work on websites that encourage people to complete tasks will benefit from understanding the social incentive tools presented in this talk. Parts of the talk will be suitable for Django beginners who have completed one Django tutorial and are familiar with the basic concepts of models, objects, views, and templates. Everyone will appreciate the cat photos.

[Music]

00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:23,850
hello thank you for coming in I'm sage

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:27,689
sharp I use they/them pronouns and this

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:29,699
talk is herding cats with Gengo so I

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,489
actually have a small confession to make

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:35,219
I have only been using Django since

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:38,129
December of last year and that's when I

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:41,700
decided to build a tree qi a new website

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:44,010
and so what is outreach e outreach e is

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:48,210
a three month internship program and

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,160
it's designed to support and increase

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,590
the diversity in free and open source

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,690
software it's a completely remote

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,480
internship program where international

00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,969
and we pay our interns which is very

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,510
important the outreach e program itself

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:05,580
we have five organizers who are involved

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,369
in running the program we just recently

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,890
hired two part-time staff members to

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:13,950
help us with internship application and

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:17,100
each round because we run twice a year

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:19,950
we run May to August and December to

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,530
March for our internship periods so each

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,450
each round we have about 20 different

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,759
free and open source communities that

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,310
are involved in outreach E and we have

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:33,540
60 different mentors that are involved

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:35,460
and so at the the last round which was

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,979
the May to August round which was the

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,810
first time we really measured how many

00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,659
people were interested in applying for

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,880
outreach e we actually got a thousand

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,460
200 applicants that applied to the

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,979
program so that's a lot of applicants

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:53,759
and these applicants have to go through

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:55,770
a pretty complex application process

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,140
they need to fill out an initial

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,390
application which includes things like

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,090
checking their time eligibility there's

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,610
a couple essay questions and then once

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,530
they've been approved they have to go

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,530
through the list of projects that

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,170
mentors submit so mentors have said you

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,940
know these are the projects this

00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,280
is the three-month project I want to

00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,680
work with someone on and they need to

00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,810
pick a project interact with the mentor

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,550
and then actually make a contribution to

00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,560
that open source project so our

00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:27,050
application process actually involves

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,630
people making a contribution to a free

00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:31,670
and open source project and then finally

00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:34,010
submitting a final application so that's

00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:36,489
a thousand plus people that we have to

00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:39,769
get to go through this somewhat complex

00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:42,380
application process so how do we get

00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:44,540
those our applicant applicants moving in

00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:47,390
the right direction there's a lot of cat

00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:51,920
herding that goes on in this in this

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:54,400
process and so our our solution to this

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,670
was to actually use a combination of

00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:01,519
Jango and social incentives to try to

00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:05,330
get people to participate in our

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:08,030
application process so as part of this

00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:10,310
new website that I was making one of the

00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:13,310
first things I did was to identify some

00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:15,290
user personas but since this talk is

00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:20,420
called herding cats with Jango I will

00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:23,690
refer to them as her sona's so this is

00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:27,019
our first persona this is an outreach e

00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:29,959
applicant and her name is trisha gupta

00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:31,579
she's a college student in India she

00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,459
really wants to get an internship and

00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:36,590
get a job in tech and she's interested

00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:39,230
in outreach e she's a little nervous

00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:42,140
and that's because she experiences

00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:45,380
imposter syndrome an imposter syndrome

00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:48,980
is a combination of unrelenting

00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:52,100
standards for yourself and with compared

00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:55,400
with the fear of asking questions

00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:58,069
especially in a public way for fear of

00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,549
being seen as less knowledgeable and we

00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:04,069
find that people who are on from groups

00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:06,560
underrepresented in tech they often face

00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:08,480
imposter syndrome because they face

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,810
discrimination they have to work twice

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,000
as hard to get there their achievements

00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,620
recognized and so that means that they

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,269
internalize that and they think that

00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,970
they're not good enough even when they

00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:22,280
are the other thing that they face is

00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,760
that because they're from a group that's

00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,410
underrepresented in tech

00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,290
they often feel like they're

00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:30,300
representing everyone who shares their

00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:32,880
gender identity who shares their race

00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:36,360
and that leads the stereotype threat of

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,150
if I fail am i failing my entire group

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,880
and so there's a lot of pressure that

00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:43,620
applicants feel when they come into our

00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,920
program as try to get started

00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:49,620
so our second persona is a mentor this

00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:52,200
is Harry Harry is really excited about

00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,690
being involved in not Ricci and he has a

00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:58,050
sense of purpose because he wants to

00:04:54,690 --> 00:05:00,270
increase diversity in in free and open

00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,730
source software and he really wants to

00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:05,910
connect with someone who is enthusiastic

00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:08,310
about his project you know really soak

00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,260
in the excitement and energy from

00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:13,380
someone who is new to open source and

00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:16,200
new to his community and the the last

00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,780
person we'll talk about is me so I'm an

00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,400
organizer for outreach e my goal is to

00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,800
make sure that the program is viable

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,080
long-term and sometimes that means I

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,840
have to make tough decisions to prevent

00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,200
mentor burnout because if a mentor works

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,580
with an applicant who's not going to put

00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,250
in a full-time effort into their

00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:38,100
internship then they may burn out and

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:40,740
decide not to come back so I'm really

00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:44,370
trying to make sure that the program is

00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:46,170
viable long term and I also have to keep

00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,450
everyone on track so we've got a

00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:50,430
six-week application process where

00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:54,390
people have to make their contributions

00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:56,430
to these open source projects and it's a

00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:58,740
very tight schedule very tight deadline

00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:01,320
and it's actually happening right now so

00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:05,670
I have some tasks while I'm at at Jenko

00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:07,830
con so for me a lot of the times what I

00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:10,410
feel is I feel overwhelmed and that's

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:12,090
mostly because of the scale of people

00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,310
who are involved in this program so

00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:16,470
there's there's me that's the main

00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,350
person who is helping run outreach E and

00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:22,380
there's 60 mentors even networking with

00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:24,630
60 mentors is a challenge but also

00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,790
answering questions from a thousand plus

00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:29,700
applicants and getting them on the right

00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:33,510
track is an additional challenge I can't

00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:35,700
do it all myself so my my process has

00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,409
been really trying to build technical

00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,169
tools

00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:41,629
build our websites documentation so that

00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:44,899
people can find the help they need

00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:48,769
connect with mentors and and actually

00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:53,479
get going so if you apply a little bit

00:06:48,769 --> 00:06:55,909
of marketing theory we've got this giant

00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:59,089
amount of applicants who are interested

00:06:55,909 --> 00:07:01,789
in applying for outreach II and and then

00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:05,239
it kind of narrows down and to finally

00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:07,489
we accept 40 interns so we have a

00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:10,009
thousand plus people who are eligible to

00:07:07,489 --> 00:07:12,379
apply and we only end up accepting 40 of

00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:14,539
them we don't have good statistics about

00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:17,929
some of the parts of our application

00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:20,329
process like did people find not find

00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:22,219
the project they wanted were they not

00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:24,079
able to find a mentor we don't have good

00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:27,139
statistics about that but we know that

00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,969
that's where most people drop off and so

00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:31,189
for me what I really wanted to figure

00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:34,099
out was for that first process of

00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:37,189
picking a project how can we make things

00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:39,949
better and the first step for that is to

00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:41,539
really understand what the applicants

00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:44,300
needs are when they're trying to pick a

00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:46,429
project and so a lot of them had worries

00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,110
about projects and they would email the

00:07:46,429 --> 00:07:50,689
outreach your organizers or the mentors

00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:53,869
mailing lists personally and say things

00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:56,240
like do you have any Python projects and

00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:59,869
so as a technical person my first

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:02,779
instinct was to problem-solve I thought

00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:05,300
oh these people can't find our projects

00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:08,179
they can't find the project that you

00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:10,429
know meets the meets what they're

00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:12,319
interested in so my first instinct was

00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:14,809
hey let's build like a search tool and

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:18,319
and have you know maybe a tagging system

00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:20,509
and help them out but when I started

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,639
asking those people and digging more

00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:25,579
into their questions about why they were

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,619
asking that particular question they had

00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:30,199
actually found the project listings and

00:08:27,619 --> 00:08:34,039
their next question was but do I need to

00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:37,029
be an expert in this particular skill to

00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:39,139
apply so again it goes back to that

00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:41,750
imposter syndrome that they were

00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:44,300
experiencing of saying thinking to

00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:46,570
themselves and like good enough to apply

00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,670
to this project

00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,890
and the other thing that we did was we

00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:52,870
looked at you know what what sorts of

00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:55,630
experiences what other pain points when

00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:57,490
they're trying to pick a project so one

00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:59,730
of the pain points was that before we

00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:02,290
had the new outreach you janggo website

00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:04,570
the projects were actually spread across

00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:06,880
all the different community web sites

00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:09,190
and wikis so people would have to go

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,950
through 20 different wikis to try to

00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,450
find the project listings they were all

00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:16,600
in different formats

00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:18,640
sometimes the mentors would not even

00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,440
list what skills were needed for this

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,390
particular project they just have a

00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,850
title that would have a lot of jargon in

00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:27,010
it even if they listed the skills

00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:30,040
oftentimes it was like the mentors wish

00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,540
list of the perfect candidate and there

00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,930
was really no indication of whether a

00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:36,310
skill was required or optional so that

00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:38,680
imposter syndrome again was getting

00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:41,649
triggered by how the projects were laid

00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,260
out um so the next step for me was to

00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:46,480
try to figure out how do I do this

00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,850
I tried to do it manually for one round

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,730
where I asked mentors to update their

00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:55,209
project listings and it would take weeks

00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:57,760
it would take far far too long for me to

00:09:55,209 --> 00:10:00,279
talk with them 60 Mentors so I had to

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,100
really figure out tools to get the

00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:05,860
mentors to put their projects in the

00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:10,240
right kind of listing so the next step

00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:13,029
as mr. Rogers likes to say is to look

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,600
for the helpers and so the mentors

00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:18,399
really know what skills are required

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,310
versus optional for their project they

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,290
know you know what skills they're

00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:26,339
willing to teach people who are applying

00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:28,750
and they also know how much experience

00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:32,680
the applicant really has in that

00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:34,810
particular skill and so these are people

00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,240
who they know their project deeply and

00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:40,480
we just need to get them to provide more

00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,829
information but especially technical

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,050
folks especially folks in the free and

00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:45,940
open-source software community it's hard

00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:48,279
for to get them to fill out paperwork

00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:51,220
and so sometimes it takes a little

00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:53,800
incentive to be able to get someone to

00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,020
to put their project in the right form

00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,960
and so what we really did was we went

00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,029
back to that user persona of the men

00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,399
and we knew that the mentor really

00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:05,430
wanted to work with an enthusiastic

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,200
intern we wanted them to list their

00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,940
project skills in a very particular

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,890
fashion

00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,300
and so what we did was we said okay

00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:14,550
we're gonna build this new website

00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,370
you're going to have to list your

00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,810
project through our website and list the

00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:22,610
skills out in this particular fashion

00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:25,290
before you can actually select an intern

00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:27,839
from the applicants who have applied so

00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:31,200
basically a little bit of carrot to say

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:34,620
no you really have to get your your

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,790
project into the right format and then

00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,500
finally you know after we've gone

00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,930
through this whole step of trying to

00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,550
understand our participants you know

00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:44,160
going through who can help so we can

00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:47,040
scale the program and how to incentivize

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,410
those people to help finally we got the

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:54,089
step where we got to build some tools so

00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:57,750
this is actually a listing of a project

00:11:54,089 --> 00:12:00,089
without Ricci and it's a Mozilla

00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:02,640
community project we've got the project

00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:05,010
title we've got the deadline to apply

00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,410
because some of the projects actually

00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:09,390
have an extended deadline and then we've

00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:12,420
got that skill listing where we really

00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:14,790
you know expand on what it means to have

00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:17,160
this skill and I think that you know

00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:20,100
people especially if you're looking to

00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,529
hire into your team's putting skills

00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,450
into this format is going to make it so

00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:26,760
that people who are from groups

00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:30,120
underrepresented in tech will apply to

00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:34,560
your jobs more and so what we have here

00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:38,250
is we have the skill and how what impact

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:41,220
it has on the intern selection so is it

00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,810
required that the applicant has that

00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,700
particular skill is that a hard

00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:47,240
requirement are they not going to get

00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:50,490
selected if they don't have that skill

00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,900
it would mentors prefer that applicants

00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:53,970
have that skill so there's always a

00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:57,690
preference towards you know the intern

00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:59,190
but but you would still accept someone

00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,170
who didn't have that skill and then

00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:02,850
finally isn't it nice to have like is it

00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:04,649
unlikely that someone would have this

00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:07,500
skill but if they had it it would be

00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:09,779
amazing and then the last part of it is

00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,630
the experience level how experience do

00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:13,149
you have to be

00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:16,899
in each of those skills so this is what

00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:18,730
the view of the project and the project

00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:22,360
skills looks like so let's dig a little

00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:24,550
into the actual Django parts of it so

00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:28,269
we've got the inner model we've got a

00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:30,730
project skill class and in the help text

00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:33,480
we really call out that we just want one

00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:36,790
skill just one not a list just one skill

00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,769
and we try to make sure you know ensure

00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:41,519
that by saying the skill description

00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:46,769
shouldn't be longer than like a sentence

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:49,389
and the next part is we have options for

00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:54,100
what is the impact on the skill on

00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:57,100
intern selection is it required is it

00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:59,889
nice to have or is it like a preference

00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,110
for the mentor and then once we take

00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:06,370
those those choices we can put them into

00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:10,480
a char field and we actually in the help

00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:13,449
text call out to the mentors hey be very

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:17,230
careful when you select this because if

00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:20,319
you say that a skill is required then

00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:23,139
the intern may not apply unless they

00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:27,220
meet a hundred percent of your skill so

00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:30,009
be very very careful in this and the

00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:34,089
other part of this model is the choices

00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:37,269
of how experienced you have to be in the

00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:38,889
skill so are the mentors willing to

00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:41,769
teach you the skill you don't have to

00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:44,110
know anything at all should you have

00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:47,019
read about the basic concepts of this

00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:49,600
skill like like know it a little bit but

00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:52,269
not have like used it and the next step

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,850
is like you've used it in a class or

00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:57,339
maybe a small personal project and then

00:14:54,850 --> 00:15:00,009
finally you should you know are you

00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:02,410
familiar with this skill but you're

00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:05,649
willing to help expand your knowledge

00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:07,240
with the help of a mentor and then

00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:09,040
finally is this going to be a challenge

00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,350
because some of the RBG projects are

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,480
really challenging and so you know

00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:15,430
calling out that you're going to have to

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,220
expand your skills maybe even without

00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:20,079
your mentors help and so this is a

00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,120
little bit of the template what it looks

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,790
like to actually enter the project skill

00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,580
we've got the small

00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:30,560
you know text field for the the project

00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:33,660
skill name we have the drop down for

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,120
whether what experience level you need

00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:39,570
for the skill and what's required and so

00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:43,620
finally digging into a little bit of the

00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:45,180
view we've got a parent class that we're

00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:49,950
sub classing here which I'll get back to

00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:52,350
but this is also in inline form set so

00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:55,260
basically basically what that means is

00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:57,270
we allow mentors to put in multiple

00:15:55,260 --> 00:16:00,570
skills at the at the same time and that

00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:02,580
sort of cuts down on the them giving

00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,240
like a giant list of skills instead of

00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,730
just one

00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,470
so the inline form set you know that

00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:09,480
from the mentor it ends up looking a bit

00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:11,610
like this it's a little long but it

00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:14,730
allows the mentor to you know add those

00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:17,550
three fields and then delete or modify

00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:21,240
it later and then later we hook it up

00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:24,810
through URLs dot PI and what we pass in

00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,490
is we pass in the community ID so which

00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:28,740
community is this project associated

00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:33,300
with the free and open-source community

00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:35,700
and what is the the project ID and in

00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,620
that that parent class what we actually

00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,240
do is we do some permissions checking

00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,040
because there are lots of people that

00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,200
are logged into the outreaching website

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,080
but not everyone should be allowed to

00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:48,900
edit the projects and so what we do is

00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,790
we make sure that this project is

00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:53,070
participating in the most current round

00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:56,960
so we grab the most current round by

00:16:53,070 --> 00:17:00,300
looking for the object that has the

00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:02,070
latest date when the intern is going to

00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,620
start their internship so that's the

00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:07,350
most current round and then we look up

00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:09,690
you know based on that project ID and

00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:12,000
the community ID and is it participating

00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:14,490
in this round to make sure that the

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,660
mentor can edit that project and then

00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,930
the last part is that permissions

00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:21,360
checking of making sure that this is a

00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:23,370
mentor who has submitted this project or

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,380
that it's a co mentor who has been

00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:27,420
approved to edit the project because

00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:31,050
sometimes there's more than one mentor

00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:33,750
on a project so that's a little bit

00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:36,690
about the code the Django code very very

00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:37,380
pretty simple code but it ended up

00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:40,440
meeting

00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:42,330
you know this need of trying to help our

00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:47,130
applicants with their impostor syndrome

00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:48,870
and help them pick a project faster so

00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:51,390
there are some pitfalls when you start

00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:54,210
to make technical tools and I talked a

00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:55,890
little bit about that of you know the

00:17:54,210 --> 00:18:00,090
first question that I encountered was

00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:02,580
you know do how do you have projects

00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:04,950
that are Python related and my first

00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,320
inclination was to build that like

00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:09,180
search tool that tagging tool but that

00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:12,140
wouldn't have fix the problem the root

00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:14,490
problem was that our applicants were

00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,410
intimidated by looking at our project

00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:19,170
list and we really needed to get it into

00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:21,510
a different a different format in order

00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:24,690
to support the imposter syndrome that

00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:27,830
they were experiencing so when you start

00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:30,480
to face that of you know coming across

00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:32,280
someone's confused in your project

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,990
someone's not using your website right I

00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,990
really encourage you to ask questions

00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:39,600
and to dig deeper so that you can figure

00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:42,750
out how to actually solve people's root

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:45,420
needs and so that's a lot of what this

00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:48,300
talk is about just using empathy to

00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:50,640
understand what are your participants

00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:52,740
needs what are their pain points and

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,660
then especially if you've got a project

00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,240
where there's a lot of people involved

00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:00,140
you need to identify who can help who

00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:03,360
can help you scale and how do you

00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:05,550
incentivize them to help and then

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,970
finally build tools to motivate them

00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:11,940
encourage them to help other people so

00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:15,420
speaking of help you can actually help

00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:19,860
out reaching out so we have to get repos

00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:22,430
one is a repository that has creative

00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:24,540
materials and promotional things

00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:27,180
especially if you speak another language

00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:29,460
we would love for you to translate our

00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:33,450
promotional materials and then we also

00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:37,080
have a Gengo repository and if you're

00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:39,060
looking for some easy fixes I'm actually

00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,700
going to be at the sprints on Thursday I

00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:44,610
would love to sprint with folks there's

00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:47,100
a tag you know Help Wanted that you can

00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:48,810
go look at in our repo and especially if

00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,250
you're new to Django I would encourage

00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:52,380
you to check out the

00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:55,560
newcomers welcome tag because that's got

00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:57,120
some pretty simple fixes that should be

00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:00,060
easy to solve if you've gone through

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:03,360
like a a really small tutorial if you

00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:05,640
know CSS or you know JavaScript we would

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,130
love to have you help because I'm I'm

00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:12,240
not an expert in that I'm good at Python

00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:14,190
not those two and so one of the things

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,380
that we want to do is we want to

00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:18,750
actually for the next round have mentors

00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,990
be able to declare what languages they

00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:24,270
speak because we get interns from around

00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:26,070
the world that it's their English is not

00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:28,290
their native language and so if they

00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,730
could find a mentor that spoke their

00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:33,900
native language they'd be able to

00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:38,640
progress so much faster but we initially

00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:40,650
had had a django package that we pulled

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,260
in that had all of the world's languages

00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:45,210
but it was two megabytes so every time

00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,370
you load a page it was two megabytes

00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:49,470
which is not great for people with with

00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:51,420
bad internet connection so we'd like to

00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,640
do some sort of Auto completion on the

00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:55,410
mentor languages but as I said I don't

00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:59,250
know JavaScript or anything like that so

00:20:55,410 --> 00:21:01,560
help would be wanted so thank you for

00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:03,480
coming to my talk I hope that you could

00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:06,570
take some of the lessons around applying

00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,790
empathy and finding ways to motivate

00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:11,330
other people to help and building tools

00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:18,490
to motivate them thank you

00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:20,550
[Applause]

00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,550
