	DjangoCon US 2018 - Fundamentals of Kubernetes for Django developers by Graham Dumpleton

A hot topic in recent years is running applications in containers. Tools such as docker and rkt have made deployment of applications using Linux containers easier, but they do not alone provide everything that is needed to easily manage many applications, or run containers at scale across a cluster of machines.

In this talk you will learn about the fundamental concepts and terminology of Kubernetes and why it is emerging as the de-facto standard for container orchestration and scheduling.

The talk will step through how to deploy to Kubernetes a Python web application, implemented using Django, as a way of seeing what happens under the covers when you do so.
