Description: 
	DjangoCon US 2018 - When your wetware has too many threads - Tips from an ADHDer on how to improve your focus by Aaron Bassett

Somewhere between 5% and 12% of adults have ADHD. Even if you do not have the disorder yourself you probably work, live or know someone who does. But the world is not designed for people with ADHD, so to be successful I’ve had to develop techniques to keep my concentration and procrastination in check.

In this talk, we’ll briefly look at what ADHD is and how it impairs not only concentration but also executive function. Then we’ll explore how changes in the workplace can benefit not just those with ADHD, but anyone whose work requires creativity or extended periods of focus. Next, we’ll look at some persistent myths about productivity, and what you can do personally to increase your concentration and output without burning out. Then I’ll present some techniques you can rollout within your team to remove distractions while improving the quality of communication.

00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,670
health issue they're very supportive of

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,989
by becoming out to the community and

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,600
talking about having a mental health

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:05,129

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,070
to talk to you about mental health and

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,930
not about what we do or what products we

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,400
sell so I'd really appreciate if you do

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,630
have a couple extra minutes to come find

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,729
us in the booth and find out more about

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:19,350
us okay so hear mine so this is me

00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:23,970
hi guys may be by like five years old in

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:26,210
this photo yes I was incredibly cute no

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:32,610
I have no idea what happened either I

00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:34,710
had a pretty normal childhood but I grew

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,979
up in the eighties and then eighties we

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:41,430
had the best music with the best fashion

00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:42,689
we had the best and shoulder pads but

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,460
unfortunately we didn't have the best

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:46,710
mental healthcare and we did not the

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,600
best ways of identifying developmental

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,799
issues and kids and schools so

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,720
unfortunately I did I didn't go

00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,960
untreated or undiagnosed for ADHD for 34

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,170
years so the majority of my adult life

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:04,110
majority of my career I've developed or

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:07,110
built my career I've run through so many

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:10,410
different jobs while not knowing I had

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,690
ADHD so I've had to kind of yes my

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,740
Medicaid it's awesome I love it but

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,140
before they I know I had to try

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,980
develop additional coping mechanisms so

00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,810
for those people who don't know what

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,100
ADHD is your heart affects you I've got

00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:26,640
like a really short video I just want to

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:28,380
blow first the prefrontal cortex PFC is

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,090
the cerebral cortex which cover this the

00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,800
frontal part of the frontal lobe the

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,630
brain region that's been implicated in

00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,400
planning complex cognitive behaviour or

00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:38,010
personality expression decision-making

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,360
and moderating social behavior the basic

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,310
activity of the brain region is

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,020
considered to be an orchestration of

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,130
thoughts and actions in accordance with

00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,900
internal goals

00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,580
the most typical psychological term for

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,680
functions carried out by the prefrontal

00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,420
cortex area is executive function

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,860
executive function relates to the

00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,600
abilities to differentiate among

00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,370
conflicting thoughts determined good and

00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,690
bad better and best same in different

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,230
future consequences of current

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:02,730
activities working toward a defined goal

00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:05,010
prediction of outcomes expectations

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,810
based on actions and social control that

00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,190
is the ability to suppress urges that if

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,380
not suppressed could lead to socially

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,480
unacceptable outcomes the frontal cortex

00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,460
supports concrete rule learning while

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,630
more anterior regions along the rostral

00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,700
caudal axis of the frontal cortex

00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:23,160
support rule learning at a higher level

00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:25,140
of abstraction okay so that's kind of a

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,320
bit of an overview then of what the

00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,030
prefrontal cortex is and then ADHD your

00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,610
prefrontal cortex doesn't develop at the

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,690
same area is somebody who's neurotypical

00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:36,330
so the images up there that's that's

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,950
showing a essentially a comparison

00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,780
between the mass of the prefrontal

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:43,770
cortex in somebody who is your typical

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,600
and somebody who has ADHD so the glowing

00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,920
areas there as where we see a difference

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,320
in mass so essentially the prefrontal

00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,610
cortical cortex isn't this developed as

00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,310
somebody who would have a neurotypical

00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:55,140
brain and that sign is pretty awful and

00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,250
it does kind of really impact your day

00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,040
to day life it does have some benefits

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,210
however I love this quote the good part

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,440
about having a mental disorder is having

00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,940
a valid reason for all the stupid things

00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,710
we do because if a damaged prefrontal

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:10,170
cortex I would be lying and if I didn't

00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:11,100
say it every night again I go sorry ADHD

00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:13,530
has nice kids

00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,080
um it also does mean as well that your

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,390
prefrontal cortex is also what is

00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,160
impaired whenever you're drunk so having

00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,950
ADHD is basically like being slightly

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,949
drunk all the time and not just because

00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,940
I'm Irish

00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:29,039
it also as you saw in the video it

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:32,699
affects of a bunch of stuff including

00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:34,440
your social control so if I can manage

00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:37,470
not to break the code of conduct and

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,759
none of you have any excuse whatever

00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,430
things it does in fact as well as

00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,560
dopamine so that means this your

00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,120
dopamine is essentially your your

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,770
brain's reward system and since way of

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,960
saying you know good job you know

00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,430
anytime you go to the gym or you take

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,020
off a JIRA ticket or you do something

00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,030
where your brain goes hey this is gonna

00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,620
help your survivability you get a nice

00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,270
little kick at that with me you know

00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:01,440
don't mean is what helps you to start to

00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:03,090
build to build good habits you know see

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,740
your you get used to having this this

00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,449
kick of dopamine you get you get your

00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,979
little fix and you want to do the same

00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:10,650
thing again to get that yeah number

00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:12,479
flakes and so on and so forth and people

00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:14,190
of ADHD unfortunately we don't produce

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,560
dopamine the same way as normal people

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,130
do so we don't have that same reward

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,289
system

00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:24,720
I also have a question um actual

00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:26,340
technical term for major depressive

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,050
disorder or depression has everybody

00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,449
calls it and that's basically caused by

00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:32,340
lack of dopamine as well so anything

00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:33,539
that really that you're trying to do

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,400
where you're supposed to be getting this

00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:37,169
like you know a nice kind of kicks in

00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,159
your brain and goes hey good job it's a

00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:41,669
little bit harder when you do have a

00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:44,550
prefrontal cortex so you really so hard

00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:46,080
to be successful because and and then I

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:49,289
haven't come across one that says you

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,720
know to be successful be flaky have bad

00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:53,280
time management you know forget what

00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,389
you're doing work on the wrong thing you

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,009
know all the stuff that the prefrontal

00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:57,960
cortex is supposed to control and

00:05:56,009 --> 00:06:00,750
supposed to help you do I don't have

00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,509
that so you know being successful based

00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,590
upon that comes in these you know

00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:06,060
self-help books it's never really going

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,669
to be an option for me you know and and

00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,690
for most people the finding success can

00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:12,000
be different you know some people it's

00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,560
like success for them is is their

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,909
salaries or renumeration its how much

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,860
they earn you know they're all about

00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:19,409
those dollar dollar belljo I know it's

00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,449
an old meme I'm also old I like it over

00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:22,949
it's fine

00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:24,990
for some people it's it's as maybe Peyer

00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,759
success in the workplace you know they

00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,349
they want to move up the corporate

00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,000
ladder and that's why they view their

00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:31,889
own success hopefully for some people

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,840
they view success as being able to help

00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:38,040
others you know for me where I find my

00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,740
success in business is

00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,840
just avoiding being bored you know

00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,820
that's for me that's that's my biggest

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,560
indicator if if I'm currently feeling

00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,930
that I'm bored in a job and I know that

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,130
I'm not being successful neither for

00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,350
myself or for the company I'm working

00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:54,060
for him I've even kind of like a little

00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:57,960
story about just how often I do switch

00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:59,730
jobs um your everybody here kind of it's

00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,070
intact probably or at least tech

00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:03,450
adjacent you know that normally you

00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,560
start a new job first thing you do is

00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,760
they give you the t-shirt they give you

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,040
the hoodie they give you the baseball

00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:11,250
cap you know all branded turn you into

00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,990
that giant walking billboard you know my

00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,450
friends used to joke that I really must

00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,740
dislike clothes shopping because as soon

00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:21,240
as a t-shirt would get tatty I would

00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:22,650
just go get another job big straight to

00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,930
the next one and they gave me two

00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:29,130
hoodies when I started they've doubled

00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:31,050
my my life at that job but yeah for me

00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:34,110
it's like I just want to avoid getting

00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,940
bored and what I mean for getting bored

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,250
is I want to hit these flow States

00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,380
you know if I'm if I'm not focused on

00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,760
what I'm doing then I'm gonna be my

00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,170
attentions gonna be all over the place

00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,050
I'm not gonna feel fulfilled I'm gonna

00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:47,370
I'm gonna be bored essentially so it's a

00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,130
really interesting book by a guy hope

00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:52,110
Cal Newport I read that I've skimmed

00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:54,120
let's be honest I've ADHD it's really

00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,410
hard to finish an entire but and but

00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,480
he's in his pocket aux about a thing

00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:00,480
called deep work and for him deep work

00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:04,170
is these three elements you know so deep

00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:06,930
work equals time times focus you know so

00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:10,440
if we look at this equation we can't

00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:12,390
really change the time part of it you

00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,620
know some people we sometimes try to do

00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,970
it you know we'll we'll hit crunch

00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,620
period and will increase our orders from

00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,060
a forty are we to sixty our week you

00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,640
know we're trying to make that the T

00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:23,250
side of that equation larger but it's

00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,420
unsustainable really the T is fixed you

00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,460
know so if we want to increase the

00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,170
amount of deep work of high-quality work

00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,600
that we're producing then the only thing

00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:32,580
that really within our control is is F

00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,610
is focused you know we need to increase

00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,020
the amount of focus that we have that's

00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,580
what actually one of the things I really

00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,530
heat up my description for ADHD you know

00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,780
its attention deficit disorder if

00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:44,190
anything it's I don't have a deficit of

00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,900
attention I've got way too freakin much

00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,460
attention I just don't have the ability

00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,530
to focus the attention on where it's

00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,730
required you know sometimes I'll not be

00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,170
the focus at at all and I'll get nothing

00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,540
done

00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll focus it on like the world's best

00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,260
research read and comment you know and

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,209
it's it's trying to figure out where

00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,980
that focus should be and if I'm

00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:02,510
constantly fighting with myself by what

00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,360
I should be focusing on or how I should

00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:07,370
be changing my focus and eventually I'm

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,070
gonna run eyes spoons the people who've

00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:12,519
not familiar with the spoons metaphor

00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:16,370
and I see came out from people who have

00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:18,230
chronic pain yeah so it was a metaphor

00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:21,110
to explain how they got free today so

00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:23,209
you at the start of the day you have a

00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:25,370
certain number of spins say you have 12

00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:26,690
spoons okay and as you do as you

00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:29,449
progressed your day and you complete

00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,889
tasks that cost you a spin you know so

00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:32,750
you get up in the morning there's a spin

00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:35,089
you go you have a shower that's a spin

00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,620
you go to work that's a spin you know

00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:38,870
all these small things you do for I

00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,070
today they SH you have to pay for each

00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,079
of them in spoons which essentially is

00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,699
willpower you know it's it's for each

00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:46,100
thing you do that you're forcing

00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:47,750
yourself to complete it's gonna stop a

00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,820
little bit of that well part not each

00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,800
person has a fixed amount of spoons that

00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,630
they can spend each day sometimes you

00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,459
can borrow some spoons from tomorrow but

00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:58,130
eventually you have to pay them back and

00:09:55,459 --> 00:10:00,380
sell your books and as well as spoons

00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,089
you know you creativity is not a faucet

00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,610
we can't just turn it on anytime that we

00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:06,079
want you know sometimes you're not going

00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,339
to be productive sometimes it's just not

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,209
going to happen you know you can sit

00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:10,459
there and you can stare at the screen

00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:11,750
for as long as you want and nothing's

00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:13,160
gonna happen because it's it's not a

00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,500
faucet it's not something that you can

00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,760
just turn on anytime you want to you

00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,230
know there's a lot of factors that go

00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,180
into being productive and being focused

00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,890
and sometimes you're just gonna have to

00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,630
go hey it's not gonna happen for me

00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,630
today I'm gonna go do something else I'm

00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:29,180
gonna go like walk the dog I'm gonna go

00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:31,310
watch a trashy TV show or play some Xbox

00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,660
or do something anything to stop be

00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,730
sitting there burning spins while you

00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,870
try to turn the faucet on but

00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:39,230
unfortunately what we actually end up

00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:41,120
doing is what you call shallow work so

00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:43,519
in the absence of deep work what we tend

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,910
to fall back on is shallow work so

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,740
shallow work is where you're you're just

00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,180
doing anything to appear to be

00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,660
productive to the other people in the

00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,240
office

00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:54,920
we're so conditioned tonight to feel

00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,829
that we have to be seen to be productive

00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:01,579
all the time that we actually create

00:10:57,829 --> 00:11:03,180
work you know it's we send those emails

00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:04,980
we write that memo we schedule

00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,480
 meetin you know we do anything

00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,610
that makes it appear - there were people

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,020
in our in our offices that were being

00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,190
productive that day but actually we're

00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,810
not doing anything we're just burning

00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:15,480
spoons we're spinning our wheels we're

00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:18,630
not getting anything done and it's it's

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,180
like the the expectation of a is through

00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:23,810
our entire industry so it's we it was

00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,800
just before Christmas I think 2017

00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:28,320
Nathan Hubbard for anybody who's not

00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:32,250
heard that name before was a Stanford

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,320
educated he was a VP it's whether he was

00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,420
CEO of Ticketmaster you know this is

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,100
somebody who's like at the pinnacle of

00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,750
business and this is what he was saying

00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,000
it's like you know whatever you're

00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:44,250
hustling for take note most people

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,360
companies are shut down until 2018 so

00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,640
he's saying like this is Christmas

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,220
period all companies are closed nine

00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,630
till 2018 that means you get two extra

00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,420
weeks to outwork a competition that's

00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,950
3.8 percent more time for perspective

00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:58,680
you see in bolt one as gold medals

00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:00,560
running 1.2 percent faster these two

00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:04,940
weeks are a gift get to work it's

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:07,260
 Christmas dude give it a break

00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:09,320
like seriously we're so ingrained that

00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,550
we have to be productive all the time

00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,400
like can't even take a break at

00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:15,780
Christmas no this is this is not high

00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,430
we're supposed to be this is not hard

00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,420
we're going to be productive either so

00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,920
you get that extra two weeks at

00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,150
Christmas for none of your vendors or

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,470
anybody else is available so you're

00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:24,060
probably not being very productive as it

00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,530
is and then suddenly you're burnt light

00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,050
in January no take the two weeks off

00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:29,820
cool relax thankfully not everybody sees

00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,850
it this way there's never quote from a

00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,120
Jayson freed the co-founder of a scam I

00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,250
love it

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,020
it's like workaholics aren't heroes they

00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,600
don't save the day they just use it up

00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:44,190
and for me that kind of that really sums

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,360
up this whole idea of shallow work just

00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,460
because somebody's there in the office

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,600
all day every day it doesn't mean that

00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,280
they're actually being more productive

00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,730
it just means that they're using the day

00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:56,250
up for my own personal experience I once

00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:59,240
worked for an ed tech company and I had

00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,980
a two-hour commute each way every day

00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,210
and I was like getting really really

00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,830
burned out on the work it was really

00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:07,340
really difficult work lots of technical

00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:09,390
debt everything was running way behind

00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,280
but I still needed to be seen to be

00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:13,650
there every day you know I felt if I

00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,390
didn't come in be sat in that seat I was

00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:17,040
letting the team dine and this is this

00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:20,639
is not an exaggeration I once came in

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,199
and spent a tire staring that that's I

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,740
seen my little terminal isn't unicorn

00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:27,750
cute but I saw it free eight hours I

00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,000
didn't go for lunch I didn't get up to

00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,560
get a drink I did nothing i sat and I

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,290
stared at that screen without blinking I

00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,480
concur sir for a tyres willing myself to

00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:37,620
be productive but I was so burned I

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,899
thought I just couldn't concentrate

00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,720
there was no way at all that I was gonna

00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:44,779
get anything done in fact I wasn't like

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,769
being successful you know I wasn't

00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:48,660
helping the company's mission or

00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:51,449
anything that in fact I was a detriment

00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,190
to my team by sitting there I was part

00:13:51,449 --> 00:13:54,690
of that sprint which meant that I was

00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,040
supposed to be taking on some of the

00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,480
tickets which meant that actually are

00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,759
burned on charge would it be better if I

00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,720
wasn't there you know all I was doing

00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:05,430
was just keeping a seat warm yes but we

00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,440
we tend to focus on the shallow work

00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,699
because deep work is hard you know it's

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,279
difficult to get into these flow States

00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:12,740
you know so if something's difficult and

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,940
there's something easier we can be doing

00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,490
sometimes we just take the easy route

00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,720
and then become self-perpetuating you

00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,949
know you get into this habit of that's

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,269
what I do when I come to work I come in

00:14:19,949 --> 00:14:23,010
and I send the email or I scheduled a

00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:24,120
meeting or I write the memo or I do any

00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,620
of these other things that I actually

00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,920
really aren't productive and are not

00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:31,199
benefiting me or the company okay so how

00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,300
can we improve our focus and how can we

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,319
get into these states of flow there's a

00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:39,500
bunch of different techniques that

00:14:34,319 --> 00:14:39,500
people use so this is a Pomodoro timer

00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:45,630
essentially as a kitchen timer that you

00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:48,240
set for 15 minutes 20 minutes whatever

00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:50,610
time period you want to use and whatever

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,620
that the timer goes off you take a five

00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:54,060
minute break either you said it for five

00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,230
minutes goes off you take your break

00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,110
when it goes off again you said it back

00:14:55,230 --> 00:15:01,139
for 20 and so on and so forth doesn't

00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:02,880
work for me I'm building in like a

00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:05,310
distraction every 15 minutes

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,839
you know I've barely opened up my editor

00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,850
and remembered which file I'm working on

00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,050
by the start of 15 minutes you know and

00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,850
then this thing he was Bing and

00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,319
something I'm like oh crap right I've

00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,149
gotta take a break for five minutes and

00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:16,769
I come back off my break and I go what

00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:18,779
was i doing oh yeah this one hacker news

00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:20,910
wasn't I know I wasn't Witter

00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:22,560
I was yeah it just doesn't work you know

00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,880
I spend the entire time just trying to

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,010
remember what I was doing we're not

00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,290
getting anything done then you have a

00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:30,130
get things done it's never really

00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:32,740
popular one

00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:34,149
get things done is workflow that you go

00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,470
for any time a task comes in where

00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:37,329
you're basically going you know can I

00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:39,610
work in a store does this need to

00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:40,839
additional information and you you

00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,519
followed in the workflow and you put it

00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:44,139
into these these little buckets to get

00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:45,250
worked on later and that's essentially

00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:46,569
the problem of it for me is you're just

00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,970
putting things into little buckets that

00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:50,050
I will then totally forget how about the

00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,550
only thing I actually really liked in

00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,959
this is the can you do it in under two

00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,870
minutes if you can you should just do it

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:58,360
there and then which I last week at this

00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:59,680
talk I said I follow that rule

00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,000
none of my colleagues are in the

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:05,529
audience I'm gonna say I try to follow

00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,579
that rule and but yeah it's that's the

00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:08,649
only part of relay to take away from

00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:09,790
this it kind of helps for me is that if

00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:12,279
it's under two minutes just trying to do

00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:16,350
there and then then we have a bullet

00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:18,699
journals bullet journal are excellent I

00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,230
have no idea if they actually work is

00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:22,500
for like to-do lists and stuff but they

00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:26,399
look beautiful

00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:29,920
these things are like an art form I

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:32,380
don't know this person's job is just to

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,310
make really pretty notebooks I don't

00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,540
think I would ever have time to get

00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,790
anything else done from this I'd be like

00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,839
oh you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna

00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,130
like I'm gonna get my color scheme

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,480
together I'm gonna do something light

00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,490
I'm gonna do some stationary shopping

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,350
I'm gonna get some new crew like it's

00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:45,399
gonna be awesome and I would never get

00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,139
any work done it's whole but they are

00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:49,149
they are beautiful like they really are

00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:51,759
if you're somebody who can actually use

00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:53,290
one of these I'm I'm so jealous

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,050
I would love to able to do that but

00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:57,670
unfortunately I can oh one thing I

00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,589
difficult is that they're not called

00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:03,639
bullet journals or any of their boo

00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:06,579
Joe's you're like friggin JLo or Kim

00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:11,380
yang I don't think I'm hipster enough

00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:12,689
for those either from another task

00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,189
management one that says pretty popular

00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:17,470
idea behind it is is you pick your worst

00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:19,449
task and you do that first thing in a

00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,589
day so it's like eating a frog you know

00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:22,209
if you eat a frog first thing in the

00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:25,089
morning there's nothing worse is gonna

00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:26,439
happen to you that day it's actually

00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:28,419
probably one of the better ones because

00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:30,580
I am quite productive in the morning so

00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:32,260
I do trying to tackle some of my more

00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,150
difficult tasks when I'm most productive

00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,490
and that's a lot of you'll find a lot

00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:39,130
for this talk is I'll be talking of that

00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:40,330
worked for me and really what I'm saying

00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,309
is these are things that I've discovered

00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,490
over time you know I'm not trying to

00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:46,760
change the way in

00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:48,080
I like my mind works I'm instead I'm

00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,910
trying to change the way that I work to

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,650
fit the way that my mind works that's

00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:54,170
probably what I would advise most people

00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,460
it's a part of the organization for

00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:57,740
people of age ADHD

00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:59,270
organization becomes unsustainable task

00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,520
because organizational systems work and

00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,690
what already important in time so all

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,890
the systems we looked at there I can

00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,180
take little bits and pieces from them

00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:07,280
and I adjust them to the way in which my

00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:09,020
mind works rather than trying to adjust

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,400
my mind into these different systems

00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,410
it's really the only system that

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,940
actually works for me as these you know

00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:18,440
they're they're visual very easy to

00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,970
create so I can just write with hash

00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,440
sign straight away you know I can

00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,080
immediately see why why I should be

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,250
working on and what I should be doing

00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,960
and they're still stuck on my monitor at

00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:29,720
home because I travel but 75 percent of

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,980
the time and so everyone's got it Stein

00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:35,270
sighs okay so all right the other thing

00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,560
then we can do to really kind of help

00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:39,230
ourselves can you slow States is our

00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,700
working environment for anybody doesn't

00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,500
recognize it the the background of the

00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,720
slide is actually this is this is

00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:48,290
Facebook so this is their their actual

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,610
like engineering floor obviously finding

00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,810
it difficult to concentrate signing here

00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:55,370
knowing this is on the screen behind me

00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:57,020
and it's not busy yeah that's just looks

00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:58,400
like a hellscape for me like there's

00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,290
open plan offices and then there's this

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,240
I would I would get absolutely nothing

00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:03,560
done there like there's just so much

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,870
distraction there's so much noise

00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,490
there's so much probably moving the

00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:09,410
things I just wouldn't work for me at

00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:11,750
all and it'd be honest open plan offices

00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:12,920
don't work for many people and we've

00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,780
known this for a while so this is a

00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,430
quote from BT future all as saying that

00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,170
the trouble of open plan offices is

00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:20,900
there a one size fits all model which

00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:25,450
actually fits nobody but for anybody who

00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:27,380
doesn't know BT is British Telecom a

00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:31,100
publicly funded company which is my

00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,020
private thank you my graphic but be some

00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:35,240
could research every now and again

00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:36,560
summer research is Steelcase I was going

00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,500
to read some of these I remember figures

00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:42,440
so a company called Steelcase pulled two

00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,240
thousand plus office workers they find

00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,310
that ninety-five percent of them said

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,710
that having privacy in the workplace was

00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,970
important

00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:52,090
forty-one percent felt they had privacy

00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:54,950
you know some vast majority of people

00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:57,400
say that privacy is important and less

00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:59,990
than half IC feel that they have it

00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:04,159
31% of the people pulled so they had to

00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:05,630
leave work to get anything done you know

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,890
like that does that not seem insane that

00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,630
you would set up this office people to

00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:10,760
come to day work and then they'd have to

00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:12,860
leave it I see get anything done most

00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,809
people said they lost an average of 86

00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,070
minutes per day to interruptions you

00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:18,650
know it's a breaks in their

00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:20,390
concentration so if we take that 86

00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:23,659
minutes per day and we multiply it over

00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:26,630
like a regular work year that's 10 weeks

00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:28,429
over the course of a year you know two

00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:30,230
and a half months of unproductive time

00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:33,380
just in those little micro interruptions

00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:36,230
every day kind of did life find that if

00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:38,990
people in open-plan offices take 70%

00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,640
more sick days yeah we've evolved we've

00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:42,080
all seen it there's that one he

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,120
comes into the office with a cold or a

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,980
flu and gives it to everybody like it

00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,870
happens because again it's actually yeah

00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,419
that was disingenuous I shouldn't I

00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:51,470
shouldn't of really means that person

00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:52,940
because the reason they come into the

00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,870
office is because of the whole shallow

00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,730
working we have to be seen to be

00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:57,110
productive you know again it's so

00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,690
ingrained in us that if we're not there

00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:00,740
bumming seat then you know we're not

00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:03,049
getting anything done we're not being

00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,490
productive I'm in fact you even need to

00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:05,840
have an open plan office if you're

00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,340
working in office it's got one other

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,100
person in it your chance of taking a

00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:12,110
sick thing increases by 50% you know we

00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,760
are filthy dirty dirty people and we

00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:15,380
spread our diseases really quickly

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,340
Queens the University of Technology

00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,340
Institute of Health and biomedical

00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,529
medical innovation did a test where they

00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:23,740
find that people in open-plan offices

00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:26,570
had 90 percent higher levels of stress

00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:28,549
they felt they had higher levels of

00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:31,100
conflict and they had higher blood

00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:32,480
pressure why this is not even affecting

00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,700
just her mental health this is actually

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,110
affecting our physical health it was

00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,370
working in open-plan offices if I would

00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:40,549
need to be in an open plan office

00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:42,169
Cornell University did a study where

00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,669
they just played the noise of an open

00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:45,590
plan office the people for the Eyres

00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,850
did nicely make them work in the office

00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:48,140
themselves he just played the background

00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:50,899
noise a timid hear from a regular open

00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:53,029
plan office and and her levels of

00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:57,409
adrenaline spiked as your

00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:58,669
fight-or-flight response I know any that

00:21:57,409 --> 00:22:00,169
they notice that they never see were

00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:02,899
feeling a lot more stressed with just a

00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:05,360
noise going on but 50% of the the people

00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:08,030
studied didn't make any economic

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,470
adjustments to their workplace you know

00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,460
so they were so distracted just by the

00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,990
noise the

00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,460
didn't even realize that they were

00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:16,130
uncomfortable and the way that they were

00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,660
sitting you know so this has a huge

00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,980
impact and it's not something this is

00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,540
lay new studies like we've known about

00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:22,850
Oakland offices and we've used open-plan

00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:24,950
offices for a while this was one from

00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,930
1896 such as the the counting room in

00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:30,170
Cambridge

00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:31,520
1900 the long room and Wellington 1902

00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:35,030
this is architecture interior design

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:37,760
firm 1939 this is probably actually the

00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:40,310
only open plan office where I would

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,940
enjoy working this is Frank Lloyd

00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:46,250
Wright's Cathedral of work you know

00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:49,010
since this is probably the the pinnacle

00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:50,510
of open-plan offices you know this he

00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:52,280
was designed to look like a forest

00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:54,620
canopy you know with lots of natural

00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,390
light coming through it each of the

00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:58,430
tables are it's a desk we see there

00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:01,250
where we're individually designed to

00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:03,350
maximize the space but while still

00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:06,800
allowing kind of free movement between

00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:08,060
departments like if you're deciding for

00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,440
your business you're actually gonna go

00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,910
co-located you're gonna have an open

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,770
plan office this is what you need to be

00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:15,080
aiming for if you count money to do this

00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:16,280
and just just don't because we get lots

00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,690
of these companies and normally when you

00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,950
make a copy of something like it's just

00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:23,000
not guys they're not anywhere near as

00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:24,380
good 1968 Henry Miller came along with

00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,340
the action office well he likes to say

00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,510
you come along with the action office

00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:29,200
who actually stole it from a German firm

00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:32,540
where they call the organic offices

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,400
action offices are this concept that you

00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:36,350
can take kind of modular furniture and

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,060
you change the office based upon what

00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,200
you need at that time you know so you

00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,400
can create different pods that people

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,320
work in or you can create little

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,020
breakout areas or you can chop and

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,100
change it it's pretty I would say that

00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,420
most people have worked in office it

00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,430
looks like this you know they all wanted

00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:52,550
like the CM IKEA catalog they're pretty

00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:54,710
much like big a cutter they're better

00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:56,300
than what we had before you know they're

00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:59,420
not quite cubicle farms but they still

00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:00,470
have a little bit of privacy but you

00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,790
know there's there still there's issues

00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:03,140
they were privacy there's issues there

00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:05,450
with noises oh she's there with

00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:07,190
distractions etc I even company it's

00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:09,620
like we're like where I work for for

00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:11,210
next MOU and we recently did a redesign

00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:13,280
of her office it's beautiful you know

00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:15,350
we've got these lovely like areas where

00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,030
people can sit and watch films or have

00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:18,380
meetups we've got like little cubby

00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:21,260
holes people to get away if they do need

00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:23,510
to spend quiet time you know even areas

00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:25,250
that should be noisy like whenever

00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:26,540
are doing our stand-ups and scrum you

00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:28,520
know they've got like noise-canceling

00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,440
curtains and stuff and then they plumb

00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:33,680
call the engineer desk start in neat

00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,850
little rows you know it's even companies

00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,130
you're trying to do it really really

00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:39,320
well they're gonna make some mistakes

00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:41,990
you know that's why this is I see my

00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:45,110
favorite desk you know it's because I

00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:47,570
have full control here you know if it's

00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:50,240
too hot so I can window if it's too cold

00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:51,440
I can turn on the heating you know okay

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,720
so I don't get like foosball tournament

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,820
I don't have like a fridge full of like

00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,890
sprite and stuff but I did a full

00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,420
control of what's there you know like I

00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:03,110
have a second laptop but all it's doing

00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:06,050
is just showing ro a TV series you know

00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:08,060
my ad the ADHD part of my brain is

00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:09,500
sometimes like a small child you know

00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,570
what she's saying either they ask me

00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,610
constant questions looking for input I'm

00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:15,140
trying to get some work done so like any

00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:16,400
good parents I just heard on Netflix and

00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:19,640
just plunk it down the front of it and

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:23,030
ignore it these trashy TV shows are just

00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,320
the right level of like stimulus with

00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:26,420
like actually being distracting they're

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,210
great I've gone freeze the entire Marvel

00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,620
University list it's fantastic but yeah

00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,730
but the whole point is I've got control

00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,650
you know if I want it done - bite it -

00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,640
don't be freaking slippers I can you

00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:36,440
know this is all stuff I can't do an

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,590
open plan office well I could but

00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,660
probably once and but here I can I can

00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:43,850
show that environment and it makes such

00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,800
a difference you know it's okay Samba

00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:47,000
slippers decide things like being with

00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,270
the control the temperature we never

00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,650
control the lights being able to you

00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:53,180
know to take a break and not feel guilty

00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,800
about it never you need to if you want

00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:57,320
to go play some Xbox or watching TV or

00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,180
whatever all these minor adjustments are

00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,160
things that will distract you and will

00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,930
prevent you from heading flow you know

00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:05,720
may seem like a very very small thing to

00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:07,520
be able to ensure that your temperature

00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,750
is set just the way that you want but if

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,830
anybody's ever tried to work an

00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:12,650
environment where it's too hot or too

00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:15,170
cold it's incredibly distracting you

00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:17,390
need to remove all this an external

00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:18,650
stimulus that is potential to the

00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:22,730
strategy from what you're actually want

00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:24,620
to do the second thing is routine so

00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:26,630
once you get our area set up the way we

00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,710
want it we're removing our barriers to

00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:29,360
getting into flow

00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:30,830
the nice thing then is routine is

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,170
training your brain that you know this

00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:35,210
is this is work time this is when I this

00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:36,790
is what I should be getting into FLOTUS

00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:39,940
is when I should be concentrating

00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:43,420
for me this is kind of my optimum you

00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:44,770
know so I get up early I said it's when

00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:47,230
I can concentrate the best so I get like

00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:48,700
some work done tonight 8:00 and 10:00 is

00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,050
when kind of the rest of the world is

00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:53,440
not going like to work and stuff and it

00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:55,150
starts to get noisier after 10:00 the

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,520
three that I'm back at work again you

00:26:55,150 --> 00:27:00,100
know I'm concentrating as well as I can

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,550
and then by three o'clock that's I'm

00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:04,330
pretty much done

00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:07,060
I'm out of spoons

00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:08,800
I don't have any concentration left so I

00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:10,780
don't force it you know that's that's

00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,210
the timer winner okay I I know I

00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:14,890
recognize this is the best time for me

00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:16,300
to works this is the time that I should

00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:18,190
be working let's not try and force it

00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:20,620
into different time slots and I've got

00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:22,090
like usual jam and stuff like that I'm

00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:24,640
part of trying to build this routine up

00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:26,560
is because as I said you got the whole

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,080
dopamine thing and the you rock and was

00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,880
like that you've got to really be very

00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,530
strict about your routine yourself you

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,430
know if you don't have the ability to if

00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:38,200
you don't have the chemical kick from

00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:39,850
your brain to help you build these these

00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,280
routines then it's something you're

00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:45,370
gonna have to be pretty strict on you're

00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,300
doing it you're manually for me and

00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:48,550
fortunately it's a little bit more

00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:51,760
difficult this is all the travel I could

00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:53,770
remember from this year so far so trying

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,170
to keep this kind of schedule tends to

00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:59,950
be a bit problematic but you do what you

00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:01,180
can okay so all this really kinds of fun

00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:03,250
you be able to control your and fireman

00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,780
control when you work as well so most

00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:07,270
people do well my managers not gonna let

00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:08,830
me do that you know they're they're

00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,960
gonna want me in the office between 9:00

00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:12,160
and 5:00 like sat in front of my desk is

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,640
because that's obviously what a

00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:17,080
manager's job is you know they're

00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,360
they're just a glorified clocking clock

00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,830
obviously you know but it's it's not

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,260
like a manager's job is it's this quote

00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:24,760
and it isn't about walking around and

00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,320
seeing if people are in the offices you

00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:29,650
know it's if I creating conditions

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,390
people do their best work you know any -

00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:33,400
any good managers I worked with that's

00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:35,320
that's really what they've seen their

00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,570
their position to be it's not a bite

00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,820
like making sure I'm actually doing my

00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:40,390
work I'm an adult I should be doing that

00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,310
myself

00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:44,020
is it by ensuring that I have the

00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:47,800
opportunity to do the best work possible

00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:49,980
I can and sometimes that you know it's

00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:53,289
really easy to do that you know

00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,850
equipment you see all these job ads for

00:28:53,289 --> 00:28:56,980
for technical roles and it's like you

00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:58,960
know you'll get the lead this MacBook by

00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:02,620
Inc that's like hiring a fireman egwin

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,779
you'll get some hoses you know it's it's

00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:07,029
a basic requirement for the job let's

00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:08,740
why is this a selling point for

00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:10,029
somewhere you know and it wouldn't be a

00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,980
selling point unless some companies

00:29:10,029 --> 00:29:13,029
where I see nickel and diming on it and

00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:15,159
weren't paying for the best equipment

00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:17,679
yeah we spend so much fun any hiring

00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:19,360
good people and then we put barriers up

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,879
to the success because we don't want to

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:25,419
pay $300 from a monitor like come on

00:29:21,879 --> 00:29:28,740
seriously but it can be managing out you

00:29:25,419 --> 00:29:32,200
know as well sometimes so I worked for a

00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:36,159
a company once was a product based

00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:38,019
company and the CEO there used to like

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,149
phone the developers directly with

00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:41,919
product requests you know he would skip

00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:44,350
the entirety of the product development

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,940
lifecycle and his phone a developer and

00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:49,210
go hey I want to change this page in

00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:50,980
this way you know so it was impossible

00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:54,669
to manage that situation because now

00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:56,799
suddenly all of our burndown charts

00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:57,879
meant nothing because people were

00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,889
getting pulled out to work on stuff that

00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:01,240
weren't working in that sprint you know

00:29:59,889 --> 00:30:02,440
we might as well not have had ticketing

00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,120
we might as well not have had like our

00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,409
entire QA process because suddenly

00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,970
everything was for an out of whack

00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:09,730
because a page is just changed on

00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:11,230
somebody's whim and that situation you

00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:12,820
know you try to manage up you speak to

00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:15,549
CEO you explain the situation to them

00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:17,559
and nine times out of 10 it doesn't

00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:19,539
change because they're to see you sir

00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:20,620
company you know that's their developer

00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:22,750
sitting in those states if they want to

00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:25,769
speak to them they well that's a very

00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,769
difficult situation to deal with

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:31,269
so what it is I put so developers and I

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,399
ask them is like so the telephones on

00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:35,500
your desks was like do you phone our

00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:37,120
departments they're like no we we get up

00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,779
and walk downstairs you know it's a

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:44,049
small company like okay so do your do

00:30:40,779 --> 00:30:45,759
your partner's or your like your sing a

00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:47,559
few lovers phone you at work on them no

00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:49,779
we we everybody has cellular phones like

00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:51,909
why would they call the company landline

00:30:49,779 --> 00:30:53,230
and get passed free it's like okay so

00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:55,179
you don't fight over departments you

00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:57,340
don't use it for like private calls I

00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:58,990
was there anything you do use your desk

00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,460
phones for like well yeah sometimes the

00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:03,020
CEO phones me up but he makes demands

00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:06,240
upon my time

00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:07,440
okay so I got a big-ass box and I walked

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,460
around every developers desk and I

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,740
unplugged the phone and I put it in the

00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:13,200
box and I said that box outside of the

00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:15,360
facilities you know they were a

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,180
distraction they were no benefit at all

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,260
to any of the developers there the only

00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,390
thing that they were causing them was

00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:23,610
additional stress and ridenour

00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:25,830
productivity so I removed that

00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:27,000
distraction and sometimes it's just

00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:28,440
thinking about that and thinking about

00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,820
different ways that you can overcome

00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,460
obstacles it may not be completely

00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:35,940
obvious to begin with that helps you

00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:37,110
with flow as well okay so we've got

00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,900
everybody nice scattered all over the

00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:42,540
world how do we communicate

00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,740
communication is key for for any kind of

00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:47,730
development and any kind of software

00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:50,190
development or engineering so I said a

00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:51,990
test message today and I'm so glad I did

00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:53,730
I had edit message in that send at night

00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:56,070
because we're we're a fully distributed

00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:57,390
team and I'm sure there'll be people in

00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:00,300
different time zones it would not have

00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:01,980
been very pleased with me if I'd woken

00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:05,580
him up just to get a screenshot for this

00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:07,880
slide and but yeah so we use slack

00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:10,740
an awful lot for a communication and

00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:13,770
weirdly we use slack but we use it force

00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:15,480
like asynchronous conversations lot of

00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:16,740
time not synchronous and that is one of

00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,350
the big adjustments you'll need to have

00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,520
if you are going to to let people work

00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,660
forever they want to work on whenever

00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,010
they want to work is that you're not

00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,030
going to get in touch of everybody as

00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:27,090
soon as you want to get in touch with

00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:30,540
them you know and to be honest that's a

00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:32,670
good thing if we get into the habit of

00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,770
just being able to interrupt anybody

00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:36,030
anytime that we want

00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:38,430
you know we that's actually detrimental

00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:40,650
to their flew it is because we need that

00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:41,970
answer right now does that mean we

00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:43,980
should be able to interrupt them and

00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:45,750
whatever they're doing you know so

00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,550
moving to this asynchronous kind of

00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:50,010
conversation or conversation flow

00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:54,650
actually helps a lot um and we have lots

00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:56,730
of rooms you know very I would see

00:32:54,650 --> 00:33:01,290
serious business talks going on about

00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:02,490
like mac and cheese and stuff yeah mac

00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:04,200
and cheese a serious business apparently

00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:06,630
in a man that will fight you if you

00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,160
don't agree we also have some like tools

00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:09,660
installed they're like we have like geek

00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:12,360
bought that allows us to do kind of our

00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:15,480
daily stand-ups in chat and things it's

00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:17,550
very useful a part of FERPA it's really

00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,590
patronizing it's like yes Kiko it's

00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:22,040
crippling self-doubt it's like grid have

00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:22,040
a nice day

00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:26,010
yeah but does it helps you mean

00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:27,300
everybody's updated when people were

00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:28,710
doing we don't need to be like footing

00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:31,230
them up all the time and finding this

00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:32,910
day is some things you know even like we

00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:35,310
use it as our water-cooler as well you

00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:36,570
know it's we because we are a remote

00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:38,250
team and we don't see each other very

00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,900
often mostly just these kind of

00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:41,730
conferences so it's kind of nice to do

00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:44,850
they keep updating people are going up

00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:46,700
to and for projects we use channels you

00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:48,900
know we use a lot of different channels

00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,920
you know and they're really useful

00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,600
because it means then that all the

00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,220
conversation is kept in one place and

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,600
you don't need to be a member of all the

00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:56,460
channels all the time you can just dip

00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,750
in and I actually need them you know so

00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,700
if you suddenly get added to different

00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:01,230
projects you can load up that that

00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,210
channel and you can get caught up on

00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:05,100
what's being discussed you know and I

00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:07,350
have quite a few different ones in there

00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,640
um I have some that I just muted as well

00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:10,680
and I don't said you see I don't read

00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:12,360
all of them all the time but it's it's

00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:15,030
really handy way to communicate between

00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:17,250
the teams okay it's last thing I want to

00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:19,500
talk about that is kind of planning so

00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:21,720
all of this stuff is like best-case

00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,100
scenario you know so you're controlling

00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,350
when you work you're controlling where

00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,880
you work initially how you work and

00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:28,730
that's good we find 90 percent of the

00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:32,070
time but then what about during crunch

00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:34,530
you know we've all heard a crunch that

00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:36,900
like period of time before like some big

00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:38,280
release or or there's some deadline

00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,020
looming or something and suddenly it's

00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,790
like all hands on deck let's let's get

00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:44,520
we need to get this done right now

00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:46,650
and during that periods of crunch and

00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,900
you know can we just heard that like

00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:51,090
creatively faucet on I'm I didn't wanted

00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:52,230
which one thing if people be fooling

00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,790
this whole thing about Red Dead

00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:59,100
Redemption to where they work a hundred

00:34:53,790 --> 00:35:01,470
hour weeks hundred hour weeks lame I get

00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:03,750
anybody think that is in any way at all

00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,620
like reasonable to have to be working a

00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,990
hundred are weeks

00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:09,030
like it's just not sustainable they did

00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:11,280
post like a press release today whenever

00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:13,710
they got some it's saying it was only

00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,780
for three weeks like oh yeah three weeks

00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:18,900
that's so much better and apparently as

00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:22,860
well it was optional yeah it's totally

00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:25,380
optional sure it was huh the problem is

00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:26,550
this like I feel like if this is our

00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,300
forty this is how productive you are

00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:30,730
doing a regular 40-hour work week

00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,990
and if it is tempting to go okay we're

00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:33,820
gonna we're gonna hit crunch times or it

00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:35,380
increases to 60 hours because you are

00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:37,810
gonna be more productive so here's like

00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:39,910
the equivalence you know so it does fall

00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:41,830
off over time as you get more fatigued

00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:43,360
then your productivity does go down but

00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:46,020
for those first like kind of what four

00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:48,460
and a bit weeks you are more productive

00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:50,170
but what we don't normally see whenever

00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,370
we see these kind of grass is the fact

00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:53,590
that yes you are more productive but

00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:55,060
your error rate goes up as well so I did

00:35:53,590 --> 00:36:02,320
a lot of research in a couple different

00:35:55,060 --> 00:36:05,160
industries looking at different

00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,990
industries where they have Studies on

00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:11,260
essentially error rates so the two that

00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:13,420
were obviously the had the most

00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:16,300
information available was the military

00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:20,440
and medical you know two industries

00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:29,470
we're awesome no speaker knows this is

00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:31,480
gonna be fun change this perfect thank

00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:36,160
you sorry I lost my timings everything

00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:38,530
there so two industries were they

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:41,470
there's not a lot of research into error

00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:43,360
rates medical and military because

00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:44,800
obviously in both of those industries

00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,050
you know if you're starting to make

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,930
mistakes and people are going to die the

00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:51,430
wrong people in the case of the military

00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:54,970
and they looks at it like junior doctors

00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:57,250
you know 57% of junior doctors have had

00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:59,950
or have nearly had some form of accident

00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:02,920
on the way home from their shift after

00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:06,520
attina after an 18-hour shift they have

00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:09,580
the their fatigue level is equivalent to

00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:12,430
a drunk driver you know it's it's

00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:14,530
incredibly the impact that just the

00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:16,900
small amount of fatigue can have on our

00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:19,180
mental capabilities so that's our

00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:21,520
regular kind of eret so let's adjust it

00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:24,640
then for for what they they saw people

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,930
get start to get fatigue this is what

00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,630
your error rate would actually then

00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:31,570
become so we can see that you know you

00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:33,490
have this huge spike after you've been

00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:35,290
running kind of crunch time for a few

00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:36,850
weeks and it starts to fall off the

00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:38,050
reason that's I see falling off there is

00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:39,850
because you're actually writing a less

00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,990
code you're less productive so you're

00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,800
writing less code so you've got less

00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:44,380
errors

00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:47,380
the area is still way above what it

00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:48,910
would be before so let's adjust the our

00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:50,440
actual productivity you know so let's

00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:52,780
say each error you know takes us a

00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,580
couple of hours to rectify you know so

00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:57,430
now we're we adjusted lying down a

00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:59,170
little bit let's be honest that we're

00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:00,550
creating areal secreting technical debt

00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:01,810
so let's knock off a few percentage

00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:04,570
points from productivity for that as

00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:06,070
well if you're running if you're working

00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:07,570
in the kind of company where they're

00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:09,130
gonna make you wrong crunch for a few

00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:11,230
weeks then they're probably not gonna

00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:13,300
care if you don't write tests see verso

00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:15,790
tests are gonna go let's be honest the

00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:17,250
first thing either it's not writing

00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:19,840
testing you're not wearing Docs either

00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:22,600
you know so suddenly that like four or

00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:24,570
five weeks of additional productivity

00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:27,100
you had it suddenly died into a week

00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:28,300
awesome so we run a week of crunch let

00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,400
me take a week off and running with your

00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:32,800
crunch we take a week know they

00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,780
discovered I'm in the computer games

00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,790
industry because who would have thought

00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:38,440
they'd run crunch a lot there but the

00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:40,030
computer game industry apparently every

00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,180
employee needed two to three weeks

00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:45,400
recovery time after any period of crunch

00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:47,770
time so if you do a week of crunch then

00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,600
you're gonna be less productive for a

00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:51,520
fortnight to three weeks afterwards so

00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,920
you need to really really be sure that

00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,780
that's that's gonna be a major benefit

00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,190
to getting something released and again

00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,810
you're probably not going to be able to

00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:00,670
produce your best where can you make is

00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:03,640
creativity it's not a faucet even I get

00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:04,960
so much physics etc so the last thing

00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,880
you might do that is is through more

00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,070
people at it this is a pretty common

00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,750
thing that they they think we can do if

00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:12,490
you mean you need to increase

00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:13,990
productivity is just increase number of

00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:16,600
people we can't work one person into the

00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:17,860
floor so let's work ten instead but what

00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,480
actually happens is something like this

00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,220
graph is what they normally say it looks

00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,950
like you know so you have you add a

00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:26,980
bunch of people productivity decreases

00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:28,570
as you have to on board those those new

00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:29,740
people get them up to speed and then

00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:32,020
once they're on boarded and productivity

00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:33,220
goes back up again what it actually

00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,570
tends look like especially if you're

00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:37,630
adding people during crunch is a bit

00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:39,040
more like this you know so you start off

00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:40,390
and in okay so you're running a little

00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,850
bit behind server he's kind of bit

00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:44,470
neutral so you add a bunch of new people

00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:46,150
but everybody was already stressed cause

00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:48,250
it's crunch time so didn't really have

00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:50,530
time to on board these new people anyway

00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,310
so productivity takes a lot longer to

00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:53,650
start to recover

00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:54,970
starts to recover a little bit your

00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,569
project managers decide it's not

00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:57,759
recovering

00:39:55,569 --> 00:39:59,259
enough so I'd only see it worked so well

00:39:57,759 --> 00:40:01,059
last time this add a bunch anymore do

00:39:59,259 --> 00:40:03,759
you people so now you have people who

00:40:01,059 --> 00:40:05,349
were never fully on board from the last

00:40:03,759 --> 00:40:07,809
time you added new people trying to on

00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:09,729
board even more new people so

00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:11,769
productivity just goes way way down

00:40:09,729 --> 00:40:13,359
it was starts recover a little but again

00:40:11,769 --> 00:40:14,499
everybody's incredibly unhappy at this

00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,719
point to you because they're all

00:40:14,499 --> 00:40:18,430
stressed and we've probably writing a

00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:19,869
ridiculous code that's incredibly ugly

00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:21,309
because nobody really knows what's going

00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:22,690
on because we found it so many new

00:40:21,309 --> 00:40:26,109
people like we don't have enough people

00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:27,190
to Train anybody and I kind of week 1011

00:40:26,109 --> 00:40:28,630
there'll be somebody on the team

00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:30,549
probably somebody who's been there from

00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:32,859
the start he'll just get so freaking fed

00:40:30,549 --> 00:40:34,539
up that there'll be this major heroic

00:40:32,859 --> 00:40:38,109
effort to try and get everything

00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:39,369
finished and once I see probably gonna

00:40:38,109 --> 00:40:41,440
happen if you're really unlucky they'll

00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:42,699
also do a partial rewrites and I've been

00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,410
in that situation before like you know

00:40:42,699 --> 00:40:46,749
what you know what this this project is

00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:50,709
running way way behind needs it needs us

00:40:46,749 --> 00:40:52,150
to start over and that person is gonna

00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:53,380
burn I'd straight away and they're

00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:56,019
they're gonna go like all sick or

00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:57,309
something and in the whole like your

00:40:56,019 --> 00:40:58,569
productivity is just gonna completely

00:40:57,309 --> 00:40:59,949
hit rock bottom because not evil so

00:40:58,569 --> 00:41:01,390
going to deal with their partial rewrite

00:40:59,949 --> 00:41:03,489
that they just left at their backside

00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:05,739
whenever they went off like burn I and

00:41:03,489 --> 00:41:07,509
you might start to recover in a couple

00:41:05,739 --> 00:41:10,329
weeks time but really your projects not

00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:11,890
on that slow slow decline to death or

00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:14,499
it's just gonna be quietly killed off

00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:17,140
because you know it's run way over time

00:41:14,499 --> 00:41:20,709
way over budget so really isn't any kind

00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:22,630
of any shortcut apart from planning you

00:41:20,709 --> 00:41:24,999
know so that's kind of like the end of

00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:26,529
my slides I just want to reiterate a

00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:29,140
couple little things you know remember

00:41:26,529 --> 00:41:31,930
try to figure out what success is for

00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:33,699
you it makes things so much easier I see

00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:36,339
if you're working on something that you

00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:39,160
enjoy to get into that flow see it you

00:41:36,339 --> 00:41:40,499
know so figure out what you regard as

00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:45,069
success and try to work towards that

00:41:40,499 --> 00:41:48,190
find a company that will allow you to to

00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:50,859
work towards that success we have team

00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:52,509
members that support you but value

00:41:50,859 --> 00:41:57,819
squirrel t-shirts to give an ADHD

00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:59,680
talking yeah look after your spins and

00:41:57,819 --> 00:42:02,289
even if your brain doesn't tell you like

00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:06,130
often enough that you rock I think you

00:42:02,289 --> 00:42:07,719
do so I'm are emboss it that's my

00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:09,220
twitter handle our company to our

00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:10,060
handles there as well and I

00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:12,310
the only thing I'm gonna have enough

00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:13,630
time for questions unfortunately I also

00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:15,849
do it can be a little bit awkward for

00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:17,320
people to ask questions anyway in a

00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:20,170
public forum about what was essentially

00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:22,570
a mental health talk I am however going

00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,980
to be a bite for the the rest of the

00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:26,470
conference so we're gonna be able to

00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:28,210
fight there please please come ask me

00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:29,800
any questions you won if you want to go

00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:30,940
somewhere more private to ask me any any

00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,670
mental health questions I'm more than

00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:35,320
happy we got a coffee or a beer if it's

00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:39,820
right after this talk preferably a beer

00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:41,200
and I'm not referring to technical talks

00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:44,080
like these things are really difficult

00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:46,150
again but yeah or or help me out with my

00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,440
DMS are open so if you'd rather just not

00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:49,420
to face-to-face you just want to send me

00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,190
a DM more than half the other questions

00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:53,560
that way as well so yeah so I've been

00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:56,080
our boss has been my my slightly

00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,330
destroyed to talk about ADHD thank you

00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:05,399
very much
