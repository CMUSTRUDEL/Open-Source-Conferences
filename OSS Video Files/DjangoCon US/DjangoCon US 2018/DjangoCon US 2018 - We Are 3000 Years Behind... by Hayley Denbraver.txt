Description: 
	DjangoCon US 2018 - We Are 3000 Years Behind: Let's Talk About Engineering Ethics by Hayley Denbraver

Your apartment building where you wake up. The water you drink. The car you drive. The road on which you drive.

In the first hour of your day, you rely on the work of several distinct branches of engineering, whose practitioners are licensed and accountable to the public.

In the second hour of your day, you may sit down at your desk to write code that dozens, hundreds, thousands, millions of people interact with in some wayâ€“but what do they know about you, your intentions, and your training?

A licensed Civil Engineer turned software developer will talk through how her former field approached ethicsâ€“something they have been iterating on for more than 3000 years. She will discuss how lessons learned from other engineering professions could apply to software, and where our industry may need a new approach to ethics.

This talk was presented at: https://2018.djangocon.us/talk/we-are-3000-years-behind-let-s-talk/

[Music]

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:24,029
really happy so many of you came out to

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:27,750
be lectured at 5:00 p.m. it's only a

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:30,560
little preachy just a little anyway my

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,809
name is Haley dan braver and my talk is

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,280
ominously called we are 3,000 years

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:40,110
behind let's talk about engineering

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,710
ethics and here's some of my contact

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,989
info

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,570
my name's Haley Dunn braver you can

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:48,899
tweet at me there if you're nice I'm a

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:52,020
software developer I I work for a Django

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:54,350
shop here in San Diego and I'm an

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,690
aspiring developer advocate

00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:00,930
now engineering ethics it's kind of

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:04,229
funny I feel like I looked in to this

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,630
topic it's been really popular on the

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:08,880
conference circuit recently and this is

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,670
actually the fifth time I've given this

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:16,439
talk so you guys get the best version

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:20,430
I'm hoping and I've kind of thought

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:24,240
about why conference organizers really

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:27,990
want to see these talks and my

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,750
conclusion was that there has been so

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:33,000
much news recently you can't really

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,450
ignore it just like these Newsies

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,420
throwing newspapers in your face and you

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:43,560
know we've had to engage with these

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:49,530
maybe scariest stories about code gone

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:52,110
wrong that this is just a topic that the

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:55,680
people organizing conferences want the

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:57,659
community to engage in so what are some

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:03,270
of these stories right

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:06,630
well they range in severity they touch a

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,569
number of different industries they can

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:13,530
range from anything to election meddling

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:18,060
- there was a story recently

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:21,120
about Wells Fargo they had a some kind

00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,980
of software bug and they foreclosed on a

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,880
bunch of people's homes without the

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:30,120
proper review and that's kind of scary

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,980
and so's the other story but it seems

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,440
like every week and every time I give

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:38,100
this talk there's another anecdote I

00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,120
could add to this list so it seems like

00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,819
all the time

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,750
we're being confronted with ways that

00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:47,420
software can go wrong and I want us to

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,820
just take a little bit of time to think

00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:54,030
about what we do and how we might

00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:57,150
approach it in a better way so I made a

00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:03,330
Venn diagram it's really exciting this

00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:06,090
is how I think about my work and how it

00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:09,030
could go wrong now the red circle are

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:13,950
bad outcomes so this is anything that

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:16,980
causes some kind of loss of failure some

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:22,680
kind of paint suffering I'm bad thing

00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:24,780
right and you know I could be immoral

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,730
and that would fall in the yellow circle

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:32,579
and these are the sort of things that

00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:35,190
Jiminy Cricket the little cricket on

00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:37,049
your shoulder your conscience would kind

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:42,140
of give you a bad feeling about like I

00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:44,910
don't know bribery cutting corners to

00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:47,280
skim money off the top yeah you know I

00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:52,920
don't know something kind of nasty like

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:56,780
that and this blue circle mistakes would

00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:59,250
be something that has zero malice but

00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:02,430
you know we're human and so sometimes

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:04,440
our code isn't perfect and I would argue

00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,739
that all the time our code isn't perfect

00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:10,109
but some of the time when we behave

00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:12,930
badly or when we make mistakes

00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:16,590
there's overlaps with this bad outcome

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:20,160
and I specifically want to talk about

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:25,020
these overlaps because these are the

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,410
areas that I want to minimize and these

00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,310
are the areas

00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:34,630
at my previous profession sought to

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:38,200
minimize so what did I used to do well I

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:42,250
used to be a structural design engineer

00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:44,320
I was a licensed civil engineer and I

00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:49,330
did all sorts of work some of it was

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:52,870
kind of boring i anchored this AC to the

00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:54,820
top of a hospital and that was that was

00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:57,010
the fun one and then the and then the

00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,570
the hotel near Disneyland that was

00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:03,220
boring one or maybe it was the other way

00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:05,290
around but the the Disney liked the

00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,680
hotel near Disneyland really was my

00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:14,980
favorite but like these are a wide

00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:19,710
variety of jobs and I was responsible to

00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:21,910
the public for both of these things and

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:26,230
want to kind of dive into that a little

00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:28,840
bit now my former profession was really

00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:31,330
really old these are old examples of

00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,240
Engineering they're also a little more

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:39,520
interesting than an AC unit on top of a

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:43,450
hotel or a hospital rather and more than

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:48,460
three thousand years ago we as civil

00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:52,600
engineers got our first taste of what

00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:56,410
it's like to be under some regulation by

00:05:52,600 --> 00:06:00,130
the state and this was the form of code

00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:02,290
of hammurabi now this was a king in

00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:04,300
Babylonia more than three thousand years

00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:07,150
ago and we're gonna read some of his

00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:13,560
laws and they are kind of harsh just

00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:16,600
warn you so here's the Codex and here is

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,580
a kind of graphic picture it's to

00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,460
prepare you for the graphic law that

00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:26,160
we're gonna read most of the Code of

00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:30,070
Hammurabi is this grisly if-then

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:33,669
statements kind of things and you might

00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:36,100
better know that form as an eye for an

00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:40,060
eye right so we call this the law of

00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:41,980
retribution so let's dive into the laws

00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,440
if a builder builds a house for someone

00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:46,690
and completes it he shall give him a fee

00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,450
of 2 shekels in money for each saref

00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:53,380
surface so this is like a refund for

00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:57,280
like small defects in your work ok I'm

00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:59,470
ok with this 2:29 if a builder builds a

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,780
house or someone and does not construct

00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,660
it properly and the house which he built

00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:08,650
falls in and killed its owner than that

00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:11,680
builder shall be put to death a little

00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:14,260
less ok with that one if it kills the

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,840
son of the owner the son of the Builder

00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:20,110
shall be put to death

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,790
WTF ok just no no if it kills a slave of

00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:23,830
the owner then he shall pay slave for

00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,840
slave to the owner of the house if it

00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,840
ruins goods he shall make compensation

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,570
for all that has been ruined and as much

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,690
as he did not construct it properly this

00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:36,250
house he built and it fell he shall rear

00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:39,460
wrecked the house from his own means

00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:41,350
we're back to somewhat reasonable ok

00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,450
the Builder builds a house or someone

00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:45,550
even though he has not yet completed it

00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:48,039
if then the walls seem toppling the

00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:53,160
Builder must make the walls solid from

00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:57,430
his own meat so this law meant that an

00:07:53,160 --> 00:08:01,510
engineer was responsible even on to loss

00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:03,880
or death and this is the point in the

00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:07,150
talk where I have a long dramatic pause

00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:10,840
and I wasn't super comfortable with that

00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:13,919
so I put a get in and this gif is Rory

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,630
explained to Paris about dramatic pauses

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:20,410
so we're gonna look at that and then

00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:24,039
we're gonna dramatic pause again so an

00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:31,210
engineer was responsible even on to loss

00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:33,880
or death now that was an old law and I

00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:36,700
want to take us a little bit more into

00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,050
the present but not too far and we're

00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:41,469
gonna talk about something that happened

00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:44,950
in 1919 and I don't know if you've heard

00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:47,260
the same that tragedy plus time equals

00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:49,240
comedy but we're gonna hope that that's

00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,430
true because I tried to pick the

00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,480
funniest story I could it's kind of I

00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,860
mean it's a disaster

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,530
so it's

00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:59,440
but but we're gonna roll with that and

00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:03,810
we're gonna talk about the 1919 Boston

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:08,110
molasses flood alright so in January of

00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:12,280
1919 a tank failed in a neighborhood in

00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:16,290
Boston and the structural defect that

00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:19,120
with the pressure of the of the tank and

00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,870
millions of gallons of molasses flooded

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,320
the area

00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:25,900
it's hop old a train track an elevated

00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,660
train track and just spilled all over

00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:31,600
the neighborhood it was pretty terrible

00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:37,140
and this says that it killed eleven but

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:40,600
eventually it was twenty-one so this was

00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:44,490
really really bad and people were really

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:49,480
really mad and they had a trial and

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:54,310
eventually it was decided that we needed

00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:56,110
some licensure for engineers so we had

00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:59,950
moved from an eye-for-an-eye

00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:03,670
of hammurabi to a system of licensure

00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:06,220
which you could also call gatekeeping so

00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:12,280
no longer i4i but Gretchen saying you

00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:15,000
can't sit with us right now this is the

00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:18,790
current department that regulates

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,250
practice of civil engineering and the

00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:24,250
reason that they license individuals is

00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:25,990
to restrict practice to people who have

00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:30,520
proven themselves through their

00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:34,360
educational credits test taking and work

00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:38,140
experience to be capable of doing these

00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:41,230
sorts of jobs right so licensure is a

00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,700
system of formalized responsibility and

00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:46,210
I want to be clear this isn't the same

00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:49,000
as ethics but taking responsibility for

00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:51,970
your work is a pretty good start so I

00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,640
just want to talk about it and I'm going

00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:58,480
to do that through a montage we're going

00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:02,320
to explore what it took for me to get my

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,730
license so what you have to do is you

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,770
have to start with dramatic music

00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:09,360
because it's a montage and that's what

00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:10,600
so something like don't don't don't

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,780
don't

00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,150
duh and then I graduated from an

00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:18,010
accredited university and it was

00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:20,830
exciting and I didn't throw my hat did

00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:23,530
anybody further hat but yeah this was me

00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:28,690
undergrad then I did some one-handed

00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:31,660
push-ups cuz I was 22 then I went to

00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:34,120
grad school cuz it was 2009 and no one

00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,590
wanted to hire anybody and I also

00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,500
learned that I didn't know how to study

00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:41,290
yet but I figured that out in my past

00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,740
grad school and then I took a well

00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,010
deserved

00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:48,010
dance break and then I worked for

00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:51,430
several years and hopefully was more

00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:53,140
competent than Homer Simpson and then I

00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:56,650
took up running because it was kind of

00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:59,890
stressful at that point I had to go door

00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:01,930
to door or rather cubicle to cubicle to

00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:04,150
all my co-workers and get them to vouch

00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:06,130
for me and I was really lucky because

00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:09,280
none of them looked at me like Lucille

00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:11,230
is looking at us right now then I had

00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,410
another dance break because Carlton is

00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:16,900
amazing and then I had to take a three

00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:19,300
day exam that cost more than a thousand

00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:22,360
dollars and almost broke my will to live

00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:24,720
and fortunately I passed the first time

00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:29,130
because that was really expensive and

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:32,010
seen and a montage thank you for

00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:36,370
tolerating my gifts I appreciate that

00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:38,830
now like I said licensure is a system of

00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:43,680
formalized responsibilities none of this

00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:47,290
montage means that I was moral or good

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:50,980
but it meant that I had kind of cleared

00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:54,610
a background check and it also meant

00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:58,300
that I had been tested on and had been

00:12:54,610 --> 00:13:00,400
exposed to ethical practice ideas

00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:03,610
through my education and through my

00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,670
testing so I promised to talk about code

00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,360
we're gonna do that right now right

00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:11,260
because that's why we're here

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:15,550
code now I used to be a civil engineer

00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:19,279
and now I'm a software engineer so what

00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:22,589
is different about these two careers

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:25,260
now I'm gonna start it off with kind of

00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:27,210
a bummer and tell you the unfortunate

00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,790
truth about the title of software

00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:33,330
engineer the title of software engineer

00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:36,750
is largely imaginary it doesn't mean a

00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:40,890
whole lot when I graduated my boot camp

00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:43,890
I was issued these business cards and

00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:46,620
they said Haley Dunn braver software

00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:48,690
engineer and I kind of looked at them so

00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:52,170
I dyed them and went I don't know about

00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:55,680
that and that's because civil engineer

00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:57,330
is a title that has to be earned and any

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,860
of you would get into trouble if you

00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:00,810
printed business cards with civil

00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,670
engineer on it just like I would get

00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:05,940
into trouble if I printed a card that

00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:08,640
said Haley dan braver MD and tried to t

00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:11,520
treat patients like you can't do that

00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:15,360
it's a protected title at least in

00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:17,399
America software engineer is not so

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,440
that's the unfortunate truth it might

00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,410
mean something to your organization to

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:27,120
your career trajectory but it doesn't

00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:29,370
mean anything in terms of our

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,650
responsibilities to the public or what

00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:37,290
the public can expect from us all right

00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:40,560
another difference in my time as a

00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:45,270
software engineer is the diversity

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:48,360
background of myself and of my team show

00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:53,520
of hands who here has a BS in computer

00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:57,330
science okay so that's not zero but that

00:14:53,520 --> 00:15:00,750
is maybe about 50% it looked like so

00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:04,140
where I work we have some comps i degree

00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:05,970
holders we have some self-taught people

00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:09,270
we have some people like me who went to

00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:10,950
a boot camp and we have some internally

00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:13,550
trained deaths that came up through a

00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:16,020
program that we have where I work and

00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:19,640
this diversity of background would make

00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:22,800
no sense in a civil engineering office

00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,149
right so that was a really big

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,980
difference well what's another

00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:32,350
difference oh these are the the varied

00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:37,090
and awesome Gophers that right

00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:39,550
Oh code I wanted pythons but the Gophers

00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:41,950
are really cute so that's what we went

00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:43,360
so what's another difference well

00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:46,480
there's a difference in how the work is

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,520
evaluated pushing to github and opening

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,400
PRS and reviewing code is absolutely

00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:55,540
necessary please do that but it isn't

00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:57,900
the same thing as taking structural

00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:01,270
plans and structural calculations to a

00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:05,260
governing body and getting them approved

00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:08,110
and then they're on file forever and you

00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,850
know can be brought up years and years

00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:12,630
later like it's just not the same thing

00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:14,860
right what's another difference oh

00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:22,860
that's something only different since I

00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:26,590
had well okay so these two careers

00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:28,300
they're different but they're different

00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:32,860
careers so why would you expect them to

00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:39,130
be the same I'm following you but so

00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:41,860
what right well it's okay to not know

00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:45,460
what you're doing all the time all right

00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,300
sometimes we write code that isn't going

00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,270
to hurt anybody

00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:52,390
I personally think that none of you has

00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:56,530
written code that has drowned anyone in

00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:59,140
molasses I know I haven't so you know if

00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:01,750
you feel like this dog ever like that's

00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:04,750
that's okay you know he's he's a good

00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:06,810
boy he would never hurt anybody all

00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,810
right

00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:14,710
and we do have some rules with respect

00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:17,110
to to how we operate

00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:18,970
there are rules about private

00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:22,870
information there's rules about health

00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:26,590
data so it's not like we're in the Wild

00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:30,580
West or a dystopian novel or anything

00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:35,590
like that right but remember those news

00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:39,970
stories from before we don't really know

00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:42,730
the future but it's possible that we're

00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,580
gonna have to wrestle with these ideas

00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:49,230
and engage with them in a meaning

00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:52,740
full way at some point right and I have

00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:53,960
some limited answers on how we could

00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:59,130
possibly do that

00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:00,500
it's just a start imagine we're in the

00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,870
first Bowser castle

00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:05,820
so our princess is in this castle she's

00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,539
in another castle but like you have to

00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,620
start somewhere

00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:11,809
so we're gonna start in this first

00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:15,750
castle these are my recommendations

00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:18,389
number one promote ethical literacy all

00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:21,389
of you are professionals and we're

00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:25,260
expected to maintain our technical

00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:27,480
literacy and as professionals ethical

00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,980
literacy is important too it's a skill

00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,539
that doctors have it's a skill that

00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:35,279
lawyers have any other profession has

00:18:32,539 --> 00:18:38,120
you know deals with these concepts so I

00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:41,429
want that to be the industry standard a

00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:46,440
good place for you to start would be to

00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:48,269
Google a CMS code of ethics and that's

00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,610
where you can begin your learning on

00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:53,279
this topic yeah

00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:55,500
the second thing I'd like to see is I

00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:58,760
would like to see review taken more

00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:01,710
seriously there was a really good talk

00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:05,100
earlier in the conference about code

00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:11,010
review skills for pythonista x' and nina

00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:13,200
mentioned that the level or like the

00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:15,440
impact of your code is going to be at

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,990
different levels and that would require

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:24,059
different sorts of review and i'm trying

00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:27,539
to make a similar point maybe you do

00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:30,750
some rubber stamping maybe you should

00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:35,399
stop that and maybe you should take a

00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:38,240
look at the potential impact of the

00:19:35,399 --> 00:19:43,380
particular code that you're pushing and

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:45,840
review it with that in mind and I would

00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:49,799
even say that for something that is

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:53,760
extremely important and has the

00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:57,460
potential to harm others I would

00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:01,480
recommend getting some outside help even

00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:04,270
if it if it's that serious bring someone

00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:07,360
else and get some fresh eyes and take

00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:10,540
review more seriously in general senior

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:15,070
should mean something what I mean by

00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:19,440
this is that we may have a diversity of

00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:23,590
backgrounds but we could have am i okay

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:26,980
okay that's perfect so seniors should

00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:29,740
mean something and by that I mean that

00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:31,650
while we have a diversity of backgrounds

00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,890
we could have a commonality of

00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,950
mentorship

00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:40,450
and professional engagement within our

00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:43,810
teams to really grow as professionals

00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:46,900
and learn from people who have

00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:49,660
established good practices prior to now

00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:51,850
and this helps with the previous two

00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:54,510
points I mentioned taking a review more

00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:57,610
seriously and promoting ethical literacy

00:20:54,510 --> 00:21:01,020
seniors can lead the way with that now

00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:03,730
fourth I want to improve communication

00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:08,170
now when I was a civil engineer

00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:11,080
I had veto power and it was amazing if

00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:17,560
someone was doing something dumb I could

00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:20,290
be like nope sorry redo that you know no

00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,820
no I don't really have that power now

00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:24,520
and I don't know if it's really

00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:27,670
necessary but what I do know is I have a

00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,830
lot of people that I work with and in

00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:32,770
order to be ethical and to build

00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:35,170
products that are going to be good for

00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:37,240
the community I need to be able to

00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,950
communicate well with them and be able

00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,500
to raise concerns if and when I have

00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:45,310
them so improving communications my

00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:47,050
fourth suggestion my fifth and final

00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:50,170
suggestion is to pretend that you're

00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:53,860
licensed and really really just just try

00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:56,010
this it's kind of weird but good now I

00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:59,140
actually did this as a civil engineer

00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:02,530
before I got licensed I had to act

00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:04,990
licensed my co-workers had to stamp my

00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:09,500
work because they needed to be stamped

00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:11,330
by a professional engineer and

00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,950
what that meant is I had to approach my

00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:17,660
work as though I would stamp it right

00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:20,300
because it's unfair to ask someone to

00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:23,120
put their name on your work if you would

00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:26,840
not be willing to put your name on your

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:31,220
work right so pretend like you are bound

00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:37,060
to some professional code and act

00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:41,840
accordingly imagine that get blame is

00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:44,320
like carved into stone and that you're

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:49,280
accountable for what you write

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:51,380
so promoting fqo literacy taking your

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,130
view more seriously senior should mean

00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,380
something

00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:56,360
proving communication and pretending

00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:59,810
you're licensed now in the last few

00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:03,230
seconds I'm gonna revisit the molasses

00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:06,890
flood a bunch of people died in molasses

00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:08,900
really terrible terrible terrible 100

00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:12,670
years before that there was something

00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:17,320
called the London beer flood which is

00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:21,800
yeah it was pretty similar a few million

00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:25,070
gallons of beer spilled and it killed

00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:28,570
eight people and maybe a ninth from

00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:32,780
alcohol poisoning it's not really clear

00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:36,290
and they the neighborhood was really mad

00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:40,550
and they held a trial and the result was

00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:43,580
that it was an act of God now I ask you

00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:47,420
why do you think that engineers haven't

00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:50,660
been really held as accountable as maybe

00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:53,660
they should and I would argue that it's

00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:57,380
because to a large portion of the

00:23:53,660 --> 00:24:00,130
community what we do is kind of magic

00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:04,490
and if you don't understand something

00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:08,750
it's easy to just accept it and to not

00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:10,880
be able to demand accountability so we

00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:13,880
don't use this language but it's a

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:17,360
similar thought so the molasses flood

00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,920
was different and I would argue the

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,309
it's because people had to walk around

00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:27,230
in their sticky neighborhood and sit on

00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:29,720
their stickies train seats and they had

00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:32,330
basically landed in the molasses swamp

00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:36,200
in Candyland and they're stuck there and

00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:38,840
it's not fun and when you can't forget

00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,929
something when you can't forget

00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:44,660
something you have to engage with it and

00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:46,850
that's what brought about change so may

00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:50,090
this stick with you when you walk into

00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:53,570
your job on Thursday or Monday or what

00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:55,850
it whenever maybe your shoes are kind of

00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:58,720
sticking to the ground and you reach for

00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:01,540
your keyboard and it's kind of gross and

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:05,049
you couldn't really forget that and

00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:08,030
don't forget this either you build

00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:10,880
products for people and they deserve

00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:16,100
your attention and your care your

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:18,410
consideration and it's okay to have a

00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:22,460
little molasses if that helps you

00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:25,070
remember it so thank you all this is my

00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:27,920
