	DjangoCon US 2018 - Here Come The Robots - Django and Machine Learning by Tom Dyson

Machine Learning is probably the most important development in our industry (and possibly our civilisation!). Previously restricted to math geniuses with access to supercomputers and massive data centres, machine learning tools are increasingly available as web services which are easily consumed from more traditional web applications. Python has become the lingua franca of machine learning, so Django developers are well placed to take advantage of the next wave of application development.

In this talk Iâ€™ll outline the various machine learning platforms and provide a set of practical examples that demonstrate how Django developers can start taking advantage of artificial intelligence in their own applications. These will include:

Image recognition - using Microsoft Azure Vision to automatically caption and label the images your users upload
Entity analysis - using the Google Cloud Natural Language API to tag news articles with people, locations and events
Predictions - using Amazon Machine Learning to build a â€˜you may also likeâ€™ feature
Sentiment analysis - using IBM Watson to understand the tone of comments submitted to your site

[Music]

00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:24,119
so yeah I'm Tom I'm I work at torch box

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:27,990
in the UK we we make the wagtails CMS we

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:29,970
created whacked OEMs that and thank you

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,940
I was gonna say I hope some of you are

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,950
familiar with it and clearly you are and

00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,940
usually that's what I talk about but

00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,020
this time somebody else did a much

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,879
better job I hope some of you went to

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,000
Sir Holmes is amazing talk yesterday and

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,879
today I'm going to talk about machine

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,379
learning which which I think is I think

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,010
it's the most important topic in our

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:54,270
industry I want to start with a request

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:57,920
and an apology the request is the

00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:01,079
request is that some of you probably

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,210
find an image that you can share with me

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,860
on slack when the time comes and this is

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,479
going to be part of a live demo all I

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:11,400
also the image is publicly accessible

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:13,260
and that it's safe for work and and the

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,159
apology is that if the apologies for my

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,740
click Beatty title and this this is this

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,110
is not a talk about kind of Terminator

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,549
star robots coming in and taking over

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:29,189
and Jango fighting them or something

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:31,950
this is it's a bit more prosaic but and

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,390
I think but I brought included it

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,799
because I feel like there is a confusion

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,020
between these concepts and this is

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,610
something that came out when I was

00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,049
describing this talk to some of my

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,270
colleagues and I think it's an

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:43,979
understandable confusion because

00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:45,299
artificial intelligence in particular is

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:49,229
a term that tends to get really

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,939
overloaded in the media but for the most

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:52,530
part this is not talk about artificial

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,939
intelligence artificial intelligence is

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,350
that I mean the simple thing if you

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,420
everyone remember this is autant

00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,000
artificial intelligence is like a super

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,380
set of technologies and concepts which

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,399
includes machine learning machine

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,439
learning is a very important component

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,469
of it but it also includes things like

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,759
natural language processing so highlight

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:10,229
for me for the conference so far was the

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,620
talk yesterday about gender bias and

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,590
Harry Potter anyone come to

00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,300
and you know that and so that used some

00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:20,080
really interesting natural language

00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:21,519
processing techniques to identify a kind

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,220
of range of connections between words

00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:26,140
and sentiments and machine translations

00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,940
another example or robotics and there

00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,349
are many of these technologies the one

00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,769
that we're going to focus on is is

00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:34,810
machine learning in this talk but if

00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:36,480
you're interested in the wider questions

00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,940
around artificial intelligence I

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,730
recommend this book life 3.0 by max

00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,739
tegmark he's a physics professor from

00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:48,970
MIT but he writes in a very accessible

00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:52,060
and compelling way and his thesis is

00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:54,040
that life as we know it is going to be

00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,200
it's going to come to be described in

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,920
three phases

00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,930
so version 1.0 is this is like the

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,970
original the simplest form of life this

00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:08,379
is this could be as like a single-cell

00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:10,030
amoeba or a chicken and and what's

00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:13,060
common about about these things is that

00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,530
they evolved slowly they evolved through

00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,810
evolution so they're hard where their

00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,889
bodies evolved but also the software

00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,180
they're they know the way that they

00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:21,459
navigate the world the way that they

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,230
they make decisions just happens you

00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:26,350
know very slowly generation by

00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:30,849
generation and then the next big change

00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:33,160
was was us humans and like chickens we

00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:35,769
have relatively little control over our

00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,750
bodies so we can go to the gym or we can

00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:41,290
eat a lot and we can make temporary

00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,900
changes but but we can't become a

00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:48,040
hundred times stronger or faster and

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:50,769
again we can we're restricted by by the

00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,540
speed of evolution however what's

00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:55,690
special about humans is that we've been

00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:58,959
able to design our own software so we

00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:02,200
can decide what language to speak or we

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,489
can decide what kind of deep sphere of

00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,139
knowledge that we're going to we're

00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:07,150
going to become expert in we can decide

00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:08,530
where in the world we want to live you

00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,639
know some people that Elise are able to

00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,799
decide that because of their

00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:14,530
circumstances and this is a very

00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,870
dramatic change interestingly there's a

00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:19,030
sort of two point one just slightly

00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,310
muddy the waters which is that in the

00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:23,050
last 50 or so years we have been able to

00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,669
make minor changes to our own hardware

00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,879
we've been

00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:29,009
we can replace our knees or I could get

00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,210
getting new teeth and you know but it's

00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:33,659
kind of chipping away at the edges it's

00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:35,159
not it's not dramatic changes and then

00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:42,719
the big one the subject of the book is

00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:45,180
life 3.0 so 3.0 like us can can design

00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:46,529
its own software but the in crucial

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,960
difference here is that it can also

00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:51,449
design its own hardware so Version three

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,340
of life will also be able to make a

00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:59,870
processor that's a hundred times faster

00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,870
we're going to try resetting this

00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:23,000
cool thank you and and and when this

00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,980
happens then we might start seeing some

00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,980
very very kind of accelerated pace of

00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:33,800
development unfortunately life 3.0 is

00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:36,650
not us life 3.0 is the machines and to

00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,850
get to life 3.0 a lot of very hard stuff

00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,870
is going to happen I mean it says this

00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:42,500
is going to be it's an extraordinarily

00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:44,830
hard problem to solve and it often is

00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,530
this described in terms of AGI which is

00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,880
general artificial intelligence so

00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:52,010
computers are really good computers are

00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,620
better at us now at playing chess or

00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:57,650
driving cars or calculating prime

00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,050
numbers but what they lack is our

00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:02,180
extraordinary versatility so you know in

00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,790
this room we can probably speak 10

00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,140
languages we can probably play 20

00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:10,310
musical instruments we probably have

00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:12,560
like deep knowledge in the fundamentals

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,900
of the Django ORM or you know how to

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,700
make the best fish taco and you know

00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:20,330
there's this kind of range of skills we

00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,650
have is extraordinary and actually on my

00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,020
basic understanding of this so far it

00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,790
feels like there's gonna have to be it's

00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,200
not even really clearly known yet how

00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,510
we're going to move from this or narrow

00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,860
intelligence that that that's that's

00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:35,780
already working really well to this

00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:37,040
general incursions nevertheless ok it's

00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,800
not true to say there's a consensus

00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,780
about where this will happen but in the

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,419
in the last survey of experts in this

00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,880
field the median answer at the point at

00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:49,460
which we achieve a GI general

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,450
intelligence is 2050 so there's a lot of

00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,770
people saying it's going to take a lot

00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:55,820
longer some people say the context soon

00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:57,500
and the media answers is is 2050 and at

00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:01,520
that point particularly when you get to

00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:04,160
human human level AGI sometimes AGI just

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,260
means human level enjoy then something

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,090
really interesting happens because from

00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:11,180
that point you only need to get to kind

00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:13,580
of 1% more than human and then then

00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,160
things may just kind of become recursive

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:19,700
and rapidly increase because a machine

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,950
that's 1% smarter than us is going to be

00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,320
better than us at building machine

00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,860
learning computers and then you know and

00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,169
so on

00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,819
so on so that's that's the sort of the

00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:32,930
trigger point that's at least that's the

00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:35,270
idea I think it's it feels like kind of

00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,789
an amazing time to be alive right life

00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:40,699
1.0 as far as we know started around

00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:41,719
four billion years ago and then humans

00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:45,800
have been around we've been around for

00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:47,449
about 100 millennia and then this next

00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,979
phase is going to happen in 30 years

00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:51,110
possibly you know that's that's the

00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:52,909
median answer you know in most of our

00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:58,659
lifetimes we're going to see this this

00:07:52,909 --> 00:08:02,810
massive change so I don't know it's a

00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:05,110
it's it's it's both frightening and and

00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,759
exciting it's feels to me like

00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:09,259
particularly striking that the same time

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,139
scales that were talking about this life

00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:15,080
3.0 are the time scales in which most

00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:16,580
scientists agree that we may enter the

00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,469
kind of cataclysmic results of climate

00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,719
change and I don't know that's just like

00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:23,599
a sort of cosmic joke that they're kind

00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:26,060
of the you know the solution may arrive

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,219
just at the same time or just after or

00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,190
maybe it's just like a kind of replaying

00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:33,740
of the same kind of apocalypse versus

00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:36,740
Messiah story that's been prevalent in

00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:37,940
world religions for millennia - anyway

00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,310
that's the end of the kind of the

00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,409
metaphor metaphysical bit of my talk and

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:45,430
the rest is is a bit more about

00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:47,720
relevance to us as Django developers and

00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,130
focusing particularly on machine

00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,890
learning this kind of specific area of

00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:54,890
artificial intelligence I really like

00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:58,310
this definition of machine learning by

00:08:54,890 --> 00:09:00,140
Francois Shirley and the classical

00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,660
programming so the programming that we

00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,519
do you know day in day out use these

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,290
rules and data to produce answers or as

00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:08,899
machine learning uses data and answers

00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:12,860
to produce rules I think a good example

00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:16,630
of this is with spam so how many of you

00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:19,010
how many of you used email before Gmail

00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:25,730
so kind of quite a number more than I

00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:27,620
was expecting but so I did and and for

00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:29,089
those of us who used to have to run

00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,459
their own email servers so you know if

00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:33,140
you were work for a you know in your

00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:35,350
organization you you would have an email

00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,760
server and it

00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,410
you have to deal with spam so everyone

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,570
has to deal with this problem of spam

00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,400
and those tools like spam assassin and

00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:45,320
you basically start writing these rules

00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,780
here everyone in my contacts list that's

00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,520
not spam something that you know

00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:52,130
includes like get-rich-quick that's

00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,320
that's that spam but then you know of

00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,640
course the people writing spam messages

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,780
are kind of aware of these rules and

00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,040
they start adapting and then you have

00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,630
new contacts and they get marked as spam

00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,790
and you have you becoming this comes in

00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:04,640
this arms race of you know your rules

00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,960
versus the reality and that's the kind

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,570
of classical programming technique and

00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,460
it's you know which which is very

00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,690
effective in many cases but it's hard to

00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,120
deal with that that could those kind of

00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:16,340
attacks the machine learning technique

00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,900
is basically so what Google's trick was

00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,070
and when you know he started using Gmail

00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:22,150
it felt like that problems just gone

00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:25,670
away they took a billion messages and

00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:27,200
they took you know a load of willing

00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:30,680
volunteers in the shape of users like

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,570
like us to mark spam or not spam so they

00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,950
took the data and they took the answers

00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,660
and then they created the rules and then

00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:37,760
they just apply that machine learning

00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,800
model to say whether this message is

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,900
spam or not spam so that's a kind of

00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,720
simple definition of these two two

00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:47,120
approaches France was surely who came up

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,000
with a really nice pithy quote he's the

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,400
author of Keros which is the Python API

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,730
for a machine learning he works at

00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,260
Google

00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:56,030
he also wrote this book deep learning

00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,410
with Python which is a fantastic

00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,920
introduction to the established

00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,630
technology

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,700
he's also amazing on Twitter and every

00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:04,520
day he says something which I feel needs

00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,690
probably the cleverest person alive okay

00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,810
so I'm going to talk about four

00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:11,090
different four different techniques for

00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:13,040
machine learning and the first one is

00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,780
what is this a picture of this is

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,580
something that I think at the first

00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:19,490
django con ten years ago this would have

00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:21,530
felt like an outlandish request to make

00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:23,930
of someone you know taking this array of

00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:26,390
pixels with different colors and

00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:28,160
brightnesses tell me what the subjects

00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,930
in this pitch this this I mean if

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,690
imagine trying to write write rules to

00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:36,590
work that out but now we're I'm able to

00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:39,770
do this with twelve pretty crufty lines

00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:42,380
of Python I'm not gonna kind of describe

00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:43,640
all of this but most of this is handling

00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:46,400
the authentication sending the right

00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:49,549
headers and then pinging a service in

00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:52,699
this case I've used Microsoft's

00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:54,739
vision service Amazon have one called

00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:56,359
recognition Google have one Microsoft

00:11:54,739 --> 00:11:58,069
have one do you know most of the big

00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:59,389
kind of cloud providers have these image

00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:01,160
recognition service but what's

00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:03,379
interesting about the Microsoft one is

00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:06,009
that as well as tags so the others the

00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:11,149
others will provide tags so they'll say

00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:13,160
human-dog myself will also do a provided

00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:15,439
description so I'm just I'm sending the

00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,769
request I'm getting it back I'm doing

00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:20,389
some ugly mugging because I want to just

00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:22,039
get the captions that are over a

00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:25,129
particular confidence limit and pick the

00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:32,720
top one of those okay this is where I'm

00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:34,669
gonna move to the demo right and this is

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,379
where I would like anyone to send me

00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:38,600
anyone who's prepared this is set to

00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:40,489
send me an image on slack and we're

00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,539
gonna we're going to try this out so it

00:12:40,489 --> 00:12:43,539
just has to be publically accessible

00:12:48,789 --> 00:12:57,519
here's one now here's one from Amy okay

00:12:53,179 --> 00:13:06,549
so this is pretty cool all right

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:08,509
copy link describe there's the picture a

00:13:06,549 --> 00:13:10,880
bird sitting on it

00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:12,330
alright I've done

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,110
[Music]

00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:18,120
I don't think it's a bird it looks like

00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,460
a sort of you know look good looks like

00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,430
a bait it's not it's a sloth that's a

00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:25,050
pretty cute sloth but it is sitting on

00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:26,580
somebody kind of more in the cup of

00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:28,430
coffee then next to it alright let's

00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:36,140
have another one

00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:36,140
Scott there's a massive URL copy link

00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:42,560
okay what's this picture gonna be sir

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:48,360
waterfall

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:52,890
dad it doesn't look hard Scott that's

00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:55,130
not a dog sure no that's no that's

00:13:52,890 --> 00:14:02,120
nothing

00:13:55,130 --> 00:14:02,120
this is mean alright Tim was Tim and Tim

00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:18,410
okay it's a nice bit cheer welcome to

00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:20,240
Miami Beach also dot okay this is not

00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:22,519
this is not a good live demo apart from

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:37,399
apart from the sloth can I try one more

00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:39,529
is anyone got one more okay probably

00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:43,010
that's not an image that's the link to

00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:47,930
it I'd have to get the image out of that

00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:50,410
all right it's probably not I made me

00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,410
copy there

00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:07,420
well okay so you know I think

00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:08,530
Microsoft's going to be work to do on

00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,190
this one

00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:14,680
[Applause]

00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:16,870
thank you for your challenging demos I

00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,069
did have some pre-prepared ones that

00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:23,009
looked really good but I thought I'd

00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:25,240
seen a risk it a bit I'm gonna move on

00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:27,970
no I'm not actually I'm gonna show you a

00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,889
pre-prepared demo so um so here's here's

00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:32,019
something a bit more in context can i

00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:37,060
zoom in on this yeah

00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:40,360
all right this is this whack CMS so this

00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:42,579
is someone who I'm Swedish guy who works

00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,130
at his cool agency could Freud I think

00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:46,509
Freud he built this as a plug into

00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:49,329
wagtail and in fact uses the same

00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:51,190
service the the Microsoft one so this is

00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:54,610
just standard wagtail I'm taking some

00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:56,529
images from my desktop select them all

00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:58,750
and drag them in and this is normally

00:15:56,529 --> 00:16:00,519
the point at which I would tag them but

00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,319
now we click we can see that the

00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:03,579
descriptions have been put before us so

00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:05,980
the bottle of beer sit next to a glass

00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:07,209
of wine red plate on the table and so

00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,980
the tags are there as well you can see

00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:12,760
underneath a herd of table there's my

00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:15,130
dog like a round dog and I think this is

00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,449
a part from the descriptions actually

00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:19,240
working this time I think this is a

00:16:16,449 --> 00:16:21,370
really nice example of how this how this

00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,899
could play out because clearly you're

00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,930
not gonna be able to rely on this this

00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:27,579
year and you know the reason that that I

00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:30,850
guess it didn't recognize the sloth is

00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:32,110
because Microsoft's library of images

00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,300
probably doesn't include many baby

00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,410
sloths yet but that will improve so so

00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,630
that you know the data will get better

00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:39,459
but at the same time we can use these

00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:42,130
techniques I think just kind of augment

00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:43,660
an editorial experience so you know for

00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,949
a situation where at content manager has

00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,120
gotten dealing with a lot of images and

00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:48,269
this is something that could speed up

00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,269
that process

00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,630
what are they use cases so accessibility

00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:53,680
I mean providing alt tags that's like

00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:56,139
you know that's the reason that we're

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,910
doing this and and web sites you know

00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:58,810
have a good technique for that HTML has

00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,100
an answer for that as long as you

00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,199
provide the alt tag but there are other

00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,059
situations in which case in which you

00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:05,799
this may not be so straightforward so

00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:07,059
for example you may be sharing images on

00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:08,709
the slack channel and you may have

00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:10,390
colleagues at work you are able to see

00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:12,610
those you could write a bot that would

00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,870
to take those images and prepare

00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,980
descriptions of them hopefully more

00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:17,920
accurate the ones we've seen before

00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:20,170
most of these most of these tools have

00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,790
systems but for telling you who can give

00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:23,620
you kind of whether or not this is

00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:25,750
pornographic or not safe for work

00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,800
material I thought a nice idea might be

00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,480
for language learning you could build a

00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,220
really simple app that would help people

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,090
like take a picture and then describe it

00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,650
and you know this could be something

00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:35,170
that you could do as a sort of simple

00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,730
language learning technique moving on

00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:39,670
because I'm gonna got 10 minutes left on

00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:44,620
to sentiment analysis so this is this is

00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:46,660
a more common more common kind of idea

00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,280
and this is trying to understand what

00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:51,130
the author is feeling when they write

00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:53,260
this in in this case again it's just

00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:55,210
like three lines of Python so I just

00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,910
have to do the authentication bit I send

00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:59,290
my I send my request and then I and I

00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,510
get the document own in this case I'm

00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,710
using IBM's Watson service I've been

00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,940
really hot on this because they were

00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,910
they're kind of dead they want to do a

00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:11,680
lot around them bought something

00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:14,230
ok demo destroy the demo moving on to

00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:17,380
sentiment so a classic use case for for

00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:20,260
sentiment analysis is with reviews I'm

00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,700
quite like Mexican food I want to see

00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:25,150
what the best Mexican restaurants are on

00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:26,740
San Diego the top one on TripAdvisor is

00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:30,400
this one called the taco stands anyone

00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:34,680
know it is it good yeah so I can see

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:38,110
some reviews if I start by picking

00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:40,540
picking excellent review the best

00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:44,550
burrito of my life ok so that sounds

00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:49,780
pretty positive let's plug that in

00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:51,940
what's he gonna say tone joy not an 0.7%

00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:53,890
of or so it's like 80% joy is the

00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:57,060
sentiment expressed in this I mean that

00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,060
sounds about right for a good burrito

00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:04,330
okay yeah but I think generally bad

00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:07,810
reviews are a bit funnier so let's we

00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:08,830
remove the excellent one mostly more

00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:12,520
excellent probably is a really good

00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:13,930
place terrible the first ones good now

00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,360
but this one is funnier I really like

00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:17,770
this one scan my critical most about

00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,320
this one is the mix of outrage and

00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:21,880
honesty scan my credit card tried to add

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,950
a forty dollar tip to my twenty four

00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:28,780
hundred twenty five dollar bill nice try

00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:31,350
you thieves food was amazing we'll never

00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,350
go back

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:44,980
prepared to be straight about it so yeah

00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:48,970
so there is joy but it's tentative kind

00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:50,470
of accurate so what are the use cases

00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:52,090
customer support is the obvious one and

00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:53,350
this is the one that most often comes up

00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,390
so you know you're getting feedback from

00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:57,400
customers you want to know how they're

00:19:55,390 --> 00:20:00,850
feeling but I think there are more

00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,080
interesting ideas like news analysis so

00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,790
you know if you were interested in

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,350
something if you wants to like know

00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:07,360
whether bitcoins bitcoins going up on

00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,670
down you might scrape a hundred news

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,020
articles every day and and measure the

00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,760
sentiment and you know that might give

00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,420
you some indications or better but so

00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,740
you know BOTS

00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,510
writing a good bot is all about being

00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,920
realistic but if you can measure the

00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:19,210
tone of the person writing to you before

00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,550
you respond and you're more likely to be

00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,960
able to give a realistic answer ok

00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,550
racing through to number three your

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,620
entity extraction sounds a bit more

00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:28,330
prosaic but this is about fundamentally

00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,170
what proper nouns is this text about and

00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,790
you might think you could do this

00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:32,950
yourself quite quickly using rules it's

00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:34,360
like something letters that start with

00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,680
capital words that start with capital

00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,610
letters are probably proper nouns but

00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,100
then you have to think what about the

00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,600
ones that start with sentences and it

00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,100
turns out that this is this is a

00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,650
slightly harder problem than you'd

00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:47,140
expect again

00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:48,520
like twenty lines of Python this one I'm

00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:55,090
using the Google natural language

00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:58,090
service and let's try this one out so if

00:20:55,090 --> 00:21:02,040
I get a new that's I'm gonna take this

00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:02,040
text from from the conference website

00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,360
add this into text and extract and here

00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,310
are the entities that just found out so

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,600
it realizes that this this piece is

00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,820
mainly around Jiang

00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,490
on us and that it's to do with community

00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:18,340
and it's also deal with Django the thing

00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:21,220
person is a bit less useful so this is

00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:23,289
you know pretty powerful and very

00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:25,750
accessible piece of content I've got a

00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:27,340
really nice another demo demo using this

00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,590
in wagtail but I'm going to skip this

00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:31,059
for now some examples as though as well

00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,529
as content management and in content

00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:34,809
management I guess the main use case is

00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:36,700
like finding thematic links between

00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:38,019
pieces of content so helping people

00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,940
especially when you have it like if you

00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:41,080
have a blog with a hundred articles then

00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,460
you probably know what the relationships

00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,799
are but if you're running a new site

00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:46,659
with two million pieces of content then

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,309
you're less likely to know that this new

00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:50,169
article is related to these other

00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:51,639
articles in different ways so using

00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:54,610
tools like this helps you create those

00:21:51,639 --> 00:21:56,440
themes plagiarism is a big big issue now

00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:59,230
in higher education in particular you

00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,090
could you could look at patterns okay

00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:02,169
finally this is the kind of perhaps the

00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,600
most interesting one and it's the one

00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:07,629
that um that we have most control over

00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:09,909
and broadly this is this type of machine

00:22:07,629 --> 00:22:11,320
learning project is about working out

00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:13,960
what's going to happen next given what

00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,009
we already know about the past and for

00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,230
this step there's this it's not just

00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:19,269
like you can't just send your bit of

00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:20,830
content and ten lines of Python you have

00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:23,169
to do a bit more work so you prepare

00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,490
your your content you have to train then

00:22:23,169 --> 00:22:26,379
you evaluate how well the model is

00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:27,759
working and then you use it for this

00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:28,960
example I'm using this is quite a

00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:32,070
well-known dataset it's a hundred

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,779
animals of zoological database and

00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:37,179
here's a selection of them we've got the

00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:38,559
names and then then the attributes which

00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:40,809
in machine learning I described as

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:43,360
features so does it have hair does it

00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:45,159
have feathers does it have eggs and this

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,409
is kind of binary so you we feed all

00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:48,519
this in most of the challenge in doing

00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,720
this this is I'm and for this one I'm

00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:51,309
using the Amazon machine learning

00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,230
service most of the challenge for this

00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:55,929
is like getting through the Amazon Docs

00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:57,970
and while I was while I was writing this

00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:01,120
I found this brilliant tweet from Vicky

00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:03,309
boy cos who and I feel like in in in

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,169
what standing up here now I'm I have

00:23:03,309 --> 00:23:08,379
delivered both three and one from her

00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:10,120
hottest programming skills of 2018 but

00:23:08,379 --> 00:23:13,809
getting info from the AWS documentation

00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:16,419
was a big challenge so I I upload my CSV

00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:18,460
has to go through s3 and then you have

00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:19,269
to explain what these fields mean and on

00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,399
the most time

00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:22,299
Amazon got it right so it works out that

00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:24,340
most of these are binary

00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:25,659
made a mistake on class type that's

00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,159
final one this is the answer we want to

00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:28,630
get so out of all these features we want

00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:30,429
to say what kind of animal is it and

00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:32,470
this is should be categorical because

00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:37,330
it's not it's not like a three is higher

00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:40,900
than two okay let's try the dummy and

00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:46,840
this is the last one so let's give me a

00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:48,429
give me an animal what was that oh okay

00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,440
okay you could answer them hard what

00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:54,130
does an aardvark have hair no feathers

00:23:50,440 --> 00:24:01,169
no eggs it has hair okay

00:23:54,130 --> 00:24:07,440
eggs milk airborne no kwatak predator

00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:15,370
tooth backbone breathes venomous fins

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:22,870
tail domestic is it cat's eyes he's in a

00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:24,909
mammal well are they gay alright so that

00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:27,340
was that was so having created this

00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:29,679
model and trained it on that data and

00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:31,270
tested its evaluation I can then the

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,649
Amazon then provide an endpoint and I

00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,539
can fire off more questions like that

00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:39,250
and it will give me it'll give me the

00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:40,600
result there's many a drop in many

00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,860
applications of this right this is this

00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,179
is kind of the main field of machine

00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,409
learning so all the unexpected

00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:45,850
segmentation is the kind of classic

00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:49,059
commercial one working out what kind of

00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:50,260
users you have in are so most of our

00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:51,370
clients are in the nonprofit space I

00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,110
think it's a you know more interesting

00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:55,029
problem for us is thinking about ways we

00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:56,649
can do donations better so you know are

00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:59,710
they a Mac user where are they based in

00:24:56,649 --> 00:25:01,000
where are they based what what so much

00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:02,260
that they go to you beforehand we can

00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,580
use tools like that to work out whether

00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,799
we're going to ask for a hundred dollars

00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:07,090
or fifty dollars I think a nice one is

00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:08,350
like this last one you can you don't

00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,390
have to use this on kind of big public

00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:11,770
data you can create your own rules based

00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:13,929
on your own happiness so you can think

00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:15,970
what did I eat how much sleep did I get

00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,740
what did I work on today how happy I was

00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,779
at the end of it you just feed in that a

00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,220
hundred times and then you can start

00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:24,340
learning the lessons of how to be

00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:25,929
happier I just want to point out though

00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,340
and I'm aware I'm out of time so I'm

00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:28,140
going to try and finish through this

00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:31,480
quickly

00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:33,309
this is a point at which for this Tyler

00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,899
machine learning there's more

00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:38,110
responsibility on you to get this right

00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:39,850
okay for example here this is a very

00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:41,650
people model but you can see that most

00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:44,679
of the most of the creatures to begin

00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:47,290
with be our category for mammals if you

00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:49,720
just gave that data to Amazon it might

00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:50,980
think that if it starts with B it's more

00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,140
likely to be a mammal we know that's

00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:54,790
correlation not causation but you have

00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,860
to you're responsible for telling of

00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:58,990
that and there's some much more sinister

00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:00,850
and dangerous areas in which machine

00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,890
learning can can can get this wrong this

00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:04,720
is a story that came out last week

00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:06,820
Amazon had this AI recruiting tool this

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,590
is extraordinary story this is this is a

00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,660
quote from someone who's involved Amazon

00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:12,429
the time they wanted it they wanted an

00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,809
engine where you give 100 resumes it was

00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:16,570
spit out the top five and we'll hire

00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:18,669
them but they discovered that it was

00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:19,870
basically it was not rating them and in

00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:21,490
gender neutral way and it's because it

00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:23,590
was trained to vet applicants by

00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:26,190
observing patterns submitted and company

00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:28,000
from over 100 for over a 10-year period

00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:30,190
basically you know and then and then you

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,620
get this headlines that AI is evil ai ai

00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:36,010
is not evil humans have been evil and

00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:37,870
prejudiced and if you train computers on

00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:39,340
that historical data in which we were

00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,480
exhibiting those mistakes then computers

00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,880
are going to contain you continue making

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,470
them so we have to be really careful and

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,090
and there are some responsibilities on

00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:48,940
us to get this right this is another

00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:52,200
this is a famous post by Robin spear

00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:54,850
where she did the kind of the minimum

00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:58,240
built a minimum tools necessary to use

00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:59,980
like standardly available corpus of text

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,419
from up from news stories and then

00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,220
measured the sentiment across it and

00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:06,299
then you know just these examples here

00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:09,549
show that the correlations between

00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:11,679
nationalities and positivity has been a

00:27:09,549 --> 00:27:13,720
really strong bias and it's you know

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,520
it's it's it's very easy for us to to

00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:19,299
make mistakes by relying on past data

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:21,190
and perpetuating prejudices okay finally

00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:23,140
finally if you want to learn machine

00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:25,000
learning I really recommend that book

00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:27,280
deep deep learning with Python and

00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,570
kegels is fantastic community if you

00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,919
want to do something straight away the

00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:31,179
machine learning you don't need to do

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,040
that you can just read the docs of those

00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:36,040
cloud services it took me three hours to

00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,360
put those sites together and I hope you

00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,230
will build something amazing with it

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:47,130
thank you

00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:47,130
