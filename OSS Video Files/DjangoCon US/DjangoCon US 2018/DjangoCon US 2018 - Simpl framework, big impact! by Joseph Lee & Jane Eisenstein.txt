Description: 
	DjangoCon US 2018 - Simpl framework, big impact! by Joseph Lee & Jane Eisenstein

Drawing upon decades of simulation and higher education experience, the Alfred West Jr. Learning Lab at the Wharton School set out to create itâ€™s own in-house developed simulation platform to accelerate our simulation delivery capabilities. However, what began as a white boarding session two years ago, morphed into the first of its kind open source simulation platform. Simpl will not only fuel the next generation of simulations written at the Wharton School, but it is our hope it will serve the foundation for countless other simulations at other schools around the world. Our open source platform puts tools in the hands of any developer who has the curiosity to create a simulation, tools that were previously unobtainable due to cost. The Learning Lab partnered with RevSys, and relying upon Python/Django and a slew of other open source tools, we were able to deliver our first simulation written in Simpl in November of 2017.

Simplâ€˜s server side is built on Python/Django and open source WAMP technologies. On the front end, Simpl uses JavaScript frameworks including React, Redux, and Autobahn. Combined, these constitute a framework for developing single and multiplayer simulations.

In this talk you will learn about simulations in the higher education space, how we developed and implemented Simpl, a demo of our first Simpl simulation, and why we think this Python/Django fueled simulation platform will have a seismic impact on the burgeoning edtech field.

Tentative outline of talk:

About the Learning Lab and simulations
The barrier to develop simulations
Why we chose to develop Simpl and make it open source
Simpl design process
Experience writing first Simpl simulation
Technical deep dive
Demo of first Simpl sim
Where we are, next steps

[Music]

00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:20,820
great thank you so yep my name is Joe

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,289
Lee I'm the director of the Alfred West

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,840
junior learning lab at the Wharton

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,039
School the University of Pennsylvania

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,510
this is my colleague Jane Eisenstein

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,060
who's the lead developer of simple and

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,140
we're really excited to share simple

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,460
with you today which we recently

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,739
open-source so we're really excited

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,320
about that I do want to preface this

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:40,500
talk a little bit beforehand you don't

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,879
need to be a higher ed developer you

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,110
don't need to be a simulation developer

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,870
or a game developer to get something out

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,760
of this talk I want to give a big shout

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,780
out to Kendall and Henry's talk I don't

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,789
know if they're here

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,100
there they are from yesterday about

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,140
Jango channels if that was interesting

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,910
to you I think a lot of that content

00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,800
will resonate with with you as well

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,559
during this presentation we're doing a

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,760
lot of similar things and but we're

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,960
building games with it so I think it's

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,600
really interesting and I hope you find

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,270
it interesting as well so before we get

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,520
into the actual platform about the

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,960
Learning Lab you don't work at a higher

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,880
ed university unless you have an

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,490
overwrought mission statement so this is

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,090
ours the Learning Lab has been around

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:24,000
since 2001 we have 33 active simulations

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,200
that we write in support about

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,009
two-thirds of which are ones that we've

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,479
written they really span the tons of

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,290
different languages we have simulations

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,060
written in Perl

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:38,400
he assimilations written in Python Java

00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:40,380
ColdFusion and simulations are written

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,460
on off the shelf like commercially

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,530
available simulation platforms as well

00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,000
and these simulations really run the

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,950
gamut in terms of subject matter we have

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,380
simulations in the accounting space the

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,000
finance base marketing entrepreneurship

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,140
we try to touch at least every

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,390
department at the school with the

00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:01,079
simulation and the simulations

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:03,840
themselves can range from 10 minute

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:07,530
simulations that you use your mobile

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,899
device for to simulations that are an

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,599
entire class we have a simulation that

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,210
we run in late August for all incoming

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,740
MBA

00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:19,030
students which is 864 people and we run

00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,250
them through a simulation in the course

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:23,680
of four days which is really an intense

00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,420
experience it's really awesome and it

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,130
really speaks to kind of the reach of

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:30,370
the Learning Lab at the school so we

00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:34,660
have over 20 our simulations are played

00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:36,670
over 20,000 times a year and they're

00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,440
also played over 10,000 times a year

00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,360
around the country in the world we have

00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,730
three simulations that are for sale on

00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,440
Harvard's Harvest Harvard Business

00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,120
Publishing which does a simulation

00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,480
platform so simulations are available to

00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,130
any university that wants to use it and

00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,990
it really speaks to kind of the reach of

00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,300
the lab and the impact of the lab has

00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,860
with a fairly small team so James really

00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,780
the only full-time developer that I have

00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,910
we work with vendors which I'll talk

00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:04,260
about later but we don't have a lot of

00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:06,490
development resources so simple really

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,430
one of the reasons we wanted to develop

00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:11,650
it was that it would help us build these

00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,780
games faster we work with a lot of

00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,010
enthusiastic faculty that you know come

00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,510
to us and like oh can you build this

00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:19,240
game you know I want to use it in a

00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,890
month and no simple-- doesn't help you

00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,380
do it quite that fast but does help you

00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,130
do it faster so that's where we're one

00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,700
of the things that we're really excited

00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:31,630
about sharing so what do we mean by a

00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:34,540
simulation well for us a simulation is a

00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:37,180
web-based multi-user application based

00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,370
on a mathematical model so you can think

00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,680
of it like this we collaborate with

00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,940
faculty and we come up with they'd be to

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,210
have a piece of research or a piece of

00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:48,610
pedagogy in their class and they'll

00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:50,890
build a mathematical model around it so

00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,990
that model can take the form of a 60

00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:56,920
page PDF with all these different

00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:58,270
formula that you know we translated into

00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,680
Python or they could be an Excel

00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,910
spreadsheet that they've been using for

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,460
years that they want to build a game out

00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,630
of so Jane will take that information

00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,280
build a mathematical model and then

00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,570
we'll build a game in Python and we'll

00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,660
build a game around that so that's what

00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:13,780
we talked about there when it comes to

00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:16,330
simulations and business education is

00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,890
really a great fit for simulations when

00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:21,070
you think about it we have students that

00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:22,780
will be managing millions of dollars

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,760
worth of assets in the real world and

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,889
this is really much better for them to

00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,449
fail in a simulation that is too

00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:30,759
the world and they're kind of bringing

00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:32,139
that pedagogy home is one of the things

00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:34,090
that simulations are really good at and

00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,740
that's why one of the reasons why we use

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,180
it a lot at the school and I think could

00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:41,860
be used in a lot of other places that

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:43,060
have don't previously use simulations so

00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,520
what are the benefits of a framework

00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,719
well kind of the basic stuff we don't

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,419
need start from scratch every time we

00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,620
build a game when we built a lot of our

00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:52,870
games have been built from scratch

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:56,979
before before we had a play a platform

00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:58,930
to build on and those games could take

00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:02,050
anywhere from six months to a year to

00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:04,840
make because games are still really

00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:06,069
complicated things to make and just

00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,419
keeping data and syncing all the

00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:10,150
plumbing required to make an interactive

00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:12,310
experience it's not easy and even with

00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,539
technology having you know grown

00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,889
dramatically in the last few years

00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:17,469
that's still not an easy thing to do

00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:19,539
just come the talk yesterday and

00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:20,500
channels it still takes a lot of

00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:23,080
plumbing to make all that happen

00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,419
seamlessly and our platform gives you

00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,879
that plumbing for you so you can

00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:30,009
concentrate on making the game so making

00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:31,270
a you know keeping data in sync between

00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:33,009
users and things like that are already

00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:37,210
done for you so you just concentrate on

00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:38,949
building the game so there are some

00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,599
existing platforms in the space that

00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:43,960
were you that you can build games upon

00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:45,909
there's a few open-source ones that

00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,009
aren't really super robust but they're

00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:50,469
out there and then there's also

00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:53,020
commercial offerings which a lot of our

00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:54,520
simulations are built again there isn't

00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,080
a lot of players in this space but there

00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,870
definitely are platforms out there that

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,599
help you build games but we're talking

00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:04,419
about licensing fees northwards of you

00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:06,460
know five figures per year they require

00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:08,560
you know a specific set of skills that

00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:10,180
just really aren't easily transferable

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,099
you need to be if you're good at

00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,899
programming it'll help you learn these

00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:14,649
platforms but those aren't skills that

00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:17,919
you're gonna be able to take to your

00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:19,800
next job and it makes it really

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,969
challenging for us to recruit and retain

00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,620
developers when they have to work on

00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:25,500
these platforms where they're really

00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,189
uncertain about what they can do next

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,830
and then it creates a lot of

00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:32,229
stratification in higher ed you know you

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,330
have universities like Penn that can

00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:36,039
afford the resources to build these

00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:39,070
simulations but a lot of other schools

00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:41,139
don't have those resources available

00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:44,139
and we've done this a version of this

00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:45,789
talk about four or five times now and

00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:48,880
we've done it in other universities in

00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:50,199
the Northeast and you know people come

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,229
up to us afterwards you're like oh wow

00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,340
I've been using this pen and paper

00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:56,740
exercise in my class for two decades

00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,419
it'd be really cool if I we can build

00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,039
like an interactive game around this and

00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:03,250
there just isn't a lot of resources out

00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:05,289
there for them to do that and I told

00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:08,949
them it's not it's that simple doesn't

00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:12,070
make it easy to do that you know pun

00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:13,419
intended but it definitely helps get you

00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:16,389
much further down the road than you

00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:18,130
could previously and Python is really

00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:20,710
prevalent in higher ed from the research

00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:22,419
angle and reaches perspective so those

00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,680
Python people with Python skill are out

00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:25,389
there and there's no reason why they

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,849
can't take our platform clone or ebrill

00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:29,470
we both do a couple tutorials and build

00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:33,250
a game and in fairly short period of

00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:35,380
time so that's really exciting so why

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,720
did we want to build it well kind of

00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:40,660
building on the points I just made we

00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:44,050
want to control over the platform we've

00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:45,909
run into a lot of issues just working

00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:48,669
within the confines of our existing

00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:50,470
tools before we built simple there are

00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:52,630
things we just couldn't do and as our

00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:55,720
needs evolved the platform's we actually

00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:57,699
we ran out of functionality in those

00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,229
platforms to make them viable for us to

00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:00,430
build games in the future so we wanted

00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,260
to build simple draw upon all the

00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,729
experience that we had and build a

00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,099
platform that was flexible enough to

00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:08,020
accommodate not only games that we built

00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:10,000
today but also hopefully games that we

00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,380
build in the future as well

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,030
and we wanted to build a community

00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,710
around this like I said there isn't a

00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:18,490
lot of players in this space but I think

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:20,470
there's a lot of untapped demand there's

00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:23,050
a lot of awesome opportunities out there

00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:25,479
for people to work on simulations build

00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,979
simulations and you just don't have the

00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:28,330
tools for it and I hope simple gives in

00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:30,340
those tools and will help build that

00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,840
community around the tool which would be

00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,760
really awesome and we did want to be

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,020
locked into different the vendor we have

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,959
a lot of technical debt the learning lab

00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:40,029
of those 33 simulations maintaining them

00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:42,789
and they're all different programming

00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:45,130
languages and professors use them and

00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,300
you know forever like decades and

00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,170
decades and they expect it to work

00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,200
forever

00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:51,310
so like building you know on this really

00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,560
I think we really Rock

00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:55,650
solid platform will help us you know in

00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,760
the future as well

00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,560
so what did we start so we started in

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,500
the spring of 2016

00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,140
shout out to the refs is folks they were

00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:08,290
our vendor partner building simple

00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:09,910
Flavio Frank Steven Jeff they were all

00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:13,390
integral in this building this platform

00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:14,860
from scratch shout-out to Sara Tom's who

00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,839
was my predecessor at the Learning Lab

00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,610
it was her idea that to build a platform

00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:19,810
to begin with and her idea to

00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:21,850
open-source it so I wouldn't be standing

00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:24,580
here giving this talk without her so

00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,080
thanks Sara so how did we start well we

00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,230
did a lot of white boarding so we took

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,750
our games and we which have a lot of

00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,250
different use cases and we kind of just

00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,750
mapped out what a model would look like

00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,760
that could accommodate all of these

00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:40,210
games and still be flexible enough for

00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:42,460
us to build upon but not so opinionated

00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:44,440
that it would you know harm our

00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,850
flexibility going forward so it was a

00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,580
lot of work on a lot of white boarding

00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:50,500
the rest has folks really brought in you

00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,970
know their perspective and that really

00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,620
helped us build this model up from

00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:56,980
scratch so their diversity points really

00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:59,500
helped us as well so we launched our

00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:02,260
first simulation which is the one that

00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,240
Jane will be sharing with you today

00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,770
rules of engagement which is a

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,800
simulation that we do in a marketing

00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:13,290
class for about 300 people we run into

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:17,020
the fall we ran it in fall of 2017

00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:19,630
it may or may not have exploded during

00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:21,640
the due date for said simulation I

00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,980
always I've worked in higher ed for over

00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:27,220
10 years now and I'm still astonished by

00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:29,380
just how close to the deadline students

00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,730
will wait to do an assignment and I just

00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,500
thought we underestimated just the

00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,089
amount of load and it just kind of blew

00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,589
up in her face we were to you know limp

00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:38,589
over the finish line and delivered for

00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:40,540
the professor and despite all of that I

00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:43,330
still thought it was a success because

00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:45,160
you know we did it we got there we

00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,260
generated tons of very interesting data

00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,760
about the platform itself and how we

00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,250
wanted to use it how we wanted it to

00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:53,980
evolve so that was really cool and then

00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:57,310
we basically had to sit down and look at

00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:58,630
the areas where it fell flat and we had

00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:00,610
to rip out a lot of the plumbing and do

00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:02,530
a lot of refactoring so it was really

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,820
our goal to open-source it in the first

00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:06,680
half of this year or late last year

00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,810
and we just opened sourcing now because

00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,250
of all the changes that we made but ruby

00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:12,440
thing really makes it a now a very

00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,150
robust platform you know one of the

00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,920
things that we had to do was move the

00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:19,220
entire platform use asynchronous

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,900
requests we also built a profiling

00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,510
framework that actually helped us

00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:26,360
simulate the WebSocket 300 folks going

00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:28,190
through the you know the WebSockets at a

00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,380
you know at simulating a deadline

00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:31,910
scenario so we were actually be able to

00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,560
profile against our production server

00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:35,060
that had the old code and then the

00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,860
development server that had the new code

00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,330
actually see that the gains we were we

00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,490
were getting and we were on the right

00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:45,740
path and comes to refactoring all of

00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:48,050
that code so we went open-source which

00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,420
is awesome so they we we opened up the

00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:53,360
repos a few weeks ago or may or may not

00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,920
be checking the github traffic stats on

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,080
the games API to see who's cloned it

00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,120
it's been at least two people so that's

00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,670
really exciting and maybe there'll be

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,070
more than two people after this talk we

00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:05,800
opened it up on github under GPL v2 and

00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:10,280
really I couldn't be prouder of the team

00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,570
rep says Jane and the entire Learning

00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,100
Lab team I really helped make this

00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,660
possible it's over two years worth of

00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,690
work and it was really awesome to see it

00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:20,630
now live and and out in the wild one of

00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:23,090
the great milestones we had last week is

00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:24,590
we had a developer who had a react

00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,990
background which we'll get into it was

00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:29,960
super valuable when looking at simple

00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:32,330
but they were able to clone the platform

00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,340
own all the repos go through the

00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:36,050
tutorials in the span of about a week

00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:38,180
we're able to make a rudimentary version

00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:40,220
of a simulation that took us over a year

00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,960
to make from scratch so that was really

00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,790
a great milestone for us like hey this

00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,470
thing actually works which you're in

00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,610
your little bubble of development and

00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,630
you're like oh yeah I think this thing

00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,400
works for them but actually someone else

00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:52,370
says it works too it's like oh cool it

00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:54,470
does work awesome so we're really happy

00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:56,210
about that so now I'm gonna pass it over

00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,700
to James gonna go kind of more into the

00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:01,240
weeds of simple and gonna show you rules

00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,240
of engagement

00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:06,220
[Music]

00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:10,620
thanks Joe

00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:12,300
yeah I'm Jane Eisenstein I'm a senior

00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:16,079
application developer at the Wharton

00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:18,240
Learning Lab I have been working more

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,930
for the Learning Lab for four and a half

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,750
years and I joined the team because the

00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:28,230
it sounded like fun to create games that

00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:30,149
help people learn and I also am really

00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,190
proud that we're able to take something

00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:36,380
that we developed for our internal use

00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:39,029
and offer it to the wider community

00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,920
so I'm gonna spend a couple of slides

00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:45,180
just kind of going over the concepts of

00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:47,279
what we mean by a game and because we've

00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,959
got some cool architecture but simple is

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,420
really focused on helping us create

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,540
these games so we built it to be

00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:58,459
flexible and support the needs of these

00:13:54,540 --> 00:14:00,779
games so as Joe had already covered

00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:03,569
games are built around a mathematical

00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:07,740
model user decisions go into the model

00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:09,920
it cranks and step through and then it

00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:12,480
produces results and this can happen

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,569
iteratively you know new decisions

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:19,170
results over several periods these

00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:21,870
periods with their associated input

00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:29,310
decisions and output results are grouped

00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:32,279
together into scenarios users and by

00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:34,380
that I mean Django users participate in

00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:38,250
a game by being assigned to a run of the

00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:40,529
game as either a leader or a player so

00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:44,459
Iran is an instance of a game for a

00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:47,040
particular group of users and the way we

00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:49,079
use it is that a professor has a class

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,810
or it has a section of a class and they

00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:54,389
want them to all be playing the game at

00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:56,639
the same time like two o'clock on Friday

00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:58,529
the 13th then they're going to put them

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,810
in the same run and so that they will

00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:04,170
they will have that same timing that the

00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:06,089
run gives them players in a run may be

00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:08,939
grouped into worlds they don't need to

00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:12,420
be but often if they are grouped into

00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:14,040
worlds that's just a team of players who

00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:17,160
typically either are collaborating

00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:22,379
together or competing against each other

00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:25,709
but the decisions they put in of all the

00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:28,170
players goes into the model and the

00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:30,480
results come out and they're they're

00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:31,949
shared by everyone in the world so

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,949
depending on you your UI

00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:37,079
you could see every other player in the

00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:39,000
world you could see all the decisions

00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:41,069
they had may all the players had made

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,050
you could see all the results that came

00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:46,500
out and it really is a UI decision about

00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:48,750
how you want to design your game the

00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,399
thing about both runs and worlds is

00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,920
they're independent of each other

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,170
one run of a game is totally independent

00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,449
of another run of a game it might have a

00:15:55,170 --> 00:16:00,889
different set of parameters you will

00:15:57,449 --> 00:16:03,899
definitely have a different set of users

00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:05,699
least players and worlds also are

00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:08,699
independent of each other what goes on

00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:12,839
within a world is hidden from what goes

00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:14,180
on in other worlds within a run all

00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:21,029
right

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:23,130
players are often assigned roles when

00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:27,180
they come into a game and that defines

00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:30,660
what they're able to see and it also can

00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:33,180
be used to may define the decisions they

00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:36,420
may make and we'll see that with rules

00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:39,779
of engagement when we do the demo run

00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:42,660
interactions occur in phases what it's a

00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:47,870
typical pattern for us is there'll be a

00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:47,870
setup phase oh wait a second I need to I

00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,370
didn't talk about leaders and players I

00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:56,009
talked about leaders briefly like

00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:58,860
teachers of primary leaders so our admin

00:16:56,009 --> 00:17:00,779
people a leader can log into a game and

00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,540
they can see multiple runs and they can

00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:05,400
see all the data about a run when a

00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:08,039
player logs into a game they just see

00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,439
information about their private

00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:12,270
scenarios or they send or they're the

00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:18,500
worlds that they the oneworld that they

00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:22,049
belong to and that is quite a focus so

00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:24,299
again going back to phases setup phase

00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:26,480
leaders would login they would be

00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:29,900
entering parameters they might be adding

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,420
players to the game

00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:34,640
when a leader moves the run to play

00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:36,200
phase that's when players can get in and

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,440
they can start entering those decisions

00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:42,020
and seeing the results and then when the

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,600
play phase is over a leader again will

00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:47,690
move the game to a debrief phase and

00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:49,520
that's what I think really to me the

00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:53,330
secret sauce of a lot of what we do with

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,130
the simulations at Wharton players run

00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,930
these models they get experienced using

00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:59,270
them but then the professor has a

00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:00,950
debrief session and he looks at results

00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:03,110
from all the different players and all

00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:05,270
the different worlds within a run and he

00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:07,730
really can use that as a pedagogical

00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:12,380
tool oh I got the word pedagogical in

00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:15,890
there so that leads us to the simple

00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:18,680
model in the Django since and I believe

00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:22,130
all the concepts that I had mentioned in

00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:26,480
the previous slides appear as a model

00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:29,390
class except the run user one down over

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,820
sort of midway down on the right the the

00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:34,040
run user is really a model that

00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:37,310
represents a many-to-many relationship

00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:43,840
between the Django users and runs within

00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:46,460
the simple database so a user may be

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,430
assigned to multiple runs either within

00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:51,710
a game or across games and a run may

00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:57,260
have multiple users but for any

00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:59,660
particular run one user 1 user is

00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:01,790
associated with one run in a one to one

00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:06,200
relationship and they either are a

00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:09,020
leader or a player and the other thing

00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,310
here is that I don't know if you can see

00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:14,140
it but there's a lot of ones in

00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:17,030
relationships going down so when the

00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:20,180
model is actually instantiated at

00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:22,370
runtime you have a tree structure even

00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:24,380
though it looks from here like you know

00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,700
og a scenario could be associated with

00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,770
the world or a scenario could be

00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:31,570
associated with a run user that's not

00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:34,430
really what the platform supports if a

00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:36,410
user either a leader or a player wants

00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:38,210
to run the model in kind of a private

00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:42,350
environment then they have their own

00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:42,919
private scenarios but if but the

00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,739
scenarios

00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:48,489
associated with a world are shared

00:19:45,739 --> 00:19:53,690
across all the members of the world so

00:19:48,489 --> 00:19:56,330
this guarantees that every model

00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:58,970
instance has a single parent which

00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:01,340
allows you to kind of traverse down from

00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:05,419
any place up to the top of the game and

00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:09,529
it allows you to pull out sub trees out

00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:11,809
of the model instances which is really

00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:15,559
an advantage and I'll just go to the

00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:20,690
next slide that talks about this when we

00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:22,820
are running games we are pulling all the

00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:24,889
data the game data that's relevant to a

00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:28,789
particular user into the browser and

00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:31,909
storing it in a redox state and we

00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:33,710
really want to hone in and bring in only

00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:36,139
information that's relevant to the user

00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:37,580
and not have them getting like updates

00:20:36,139 --> 00:20:41,509
from things that have nothing to do with

00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:44,230
them so it's really cool that we can do

00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:47,779
this but like how how does this work and

00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:49,249
since this is a django conference when

00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:52,070
i'm going to focus a little bit more on

00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:57,139
the front end service then we might do

00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:59,299
otherwise a simple game is composed of a

00:20:57,139 --> 00:21:01,909
front end service and a model service

00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:03,739
that are unique to that game and it uses

00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:07,879
the database service that is shared

00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:10,249
across all the games and in the front

00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:14,379
end service there is actually a very

00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:16,340
small django application and its

00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:19,759
responsibilities are authenticating

00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:23,289
users and it is once the user is

00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:29,119
authenticated then the view for that

00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:31,580
django app well it's not shown here but

00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:34,220
the the front-end will actually query

00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:36,230
the simple database to find out what

00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:38,059
runs the user is associated with and

00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:41,149
whether they're associated is a leader

00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:43,580
or a player and based on that if figures

00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:45,259
out what subtree of all the the data

00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:47,960
instances for that game it should pull

00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:54,109
back and put into the into the react

00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:55,940
store so once it's done that query it

00:21:54,109 --> 00:21:56,750
hands it off to a single page

00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:01,659
application

00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:06,320
and the rest of the UI logic is handled

00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:08,330
in react and redux and from then on any

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,130
time when the react wants to know

00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:14,919
something about the database or make

00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:17,570
changes in the database it asks that it

00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:19,600
communicates with the model service over

00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:24,909
WAMP which is web application medic

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,909
messaging protocol using WebSockets and

00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:32,630
so all that communication goes through

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,150
the model service to the database

00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:38,240
service any updates that happen in the

00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:40,370
database will trigger web hooks which

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,890
fire and go back to the model service

00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:44,809
and which then they broadcast back to

00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:49,250
the the subscribers for the particular

00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:53,630
portions of the of the data model let me

00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:58,330
see what else I want to cover yeah so

00:22:53,630 --> 00:23:01,039
the model service is again written by

00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:04,070
the developer it's specific to the game

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:07,520
it implements the simulation model in

00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:10,340
Python and it also creates custom

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,520
classes with methods that are can be

00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:15,770
accessed via WAMP and it does that by

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,110
sub classing off these scope objects

00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:21,620
that are find in the simple model the

00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:23,960
model service package so when the model

00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:26,090
service starts up it queries the

00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,429
database from about all the active runs

00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:32,740
it pulls that in that information it

00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:32,740
creates these scope objects that

00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:42,080
basically it creates a copy of the

00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:44,419
active runs of of the game in memory and

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,580
that means when the browser just wants

00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:50,150
to refresh a page it that nobody has to

00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:51,409
hit the database it just says hey tell

00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:53,570
me about that you know tell me about

00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:55,850
this portion of the data objects again

00:23:53,570 --> 00:24:00,190
and then it can display it which keeps

00:23:55,850 --> 00:24:00,190
the load off the shared database service

00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:09,490
and so I think I've covered that to me

00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:10,900
the the primary things that you as a

00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:13,360
developer you need to know about the

00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:15,220
simple model service is it provides

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:20,470
these scope classes that can be subclass

00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:22,270
to create the business features that you

00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:25,120
need for your particular game things

00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:28,630
like to submit a decision you do that by

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,700
creating a subclass of a scope object

00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:33,279
and say when I submitted a decision you

00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:39,029
need to you know create a decision in

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:43,510
the database and also the web callbacks

00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:47,980
and now I will go on and take a quick

00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:49,510
look at the technology stack we went out

00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:52,299
the door with the zero-point-seven

00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:54,700
release using Python three six django

00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:57,159
111 i'm not sure of the Django rest

00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:59,890
framework version the web hooks are

00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:02,289
implemented using thorn the WAMP is

00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:05,860
implementing using crossbar i/o on the

00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:09,779
Java side a Java site on the Python side

00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:12,700
and audubon on the JavaScript side and

00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:15,789
again we're using react and redux to

00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:19,149
implement our single page application it

00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:22,049
is now time for the live demo please

00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:22,049
send good thoughts

00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:42,519
this first part of the demo is running

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:45,789
on my local machine it is just to give

00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:48,100
you an idea of what goes on when you've

00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:49,899
logged in and how what information is

00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,830
needed to pull the information into the

00:25:49,899 --> 00:25:59,620
Redux state that's specific to this user

00:25:52,830 --> 00:26:00,039
so this stuff that got so but okay slow

00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:03,070
down

00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:04,419
rules of engagement is a tip book it's a

00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:08,740
multiplayer game

00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:10,690
it has worlds each world comprises three

00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:13,720
players with through three different

00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:15,340
roles and then it has a leader and the

00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,690
leader as you can see here can be

00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,429
looking at multiple runs

00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:20,649
it's called classes but there's a

00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:23,649
default run and a django con run and

00:26:20,649 --> 00:26:26,940
they're in different phases the debrief

00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:29,230
the default run is still in setup and

00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:32,070
here is where someone can go in and

00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:34,210
change the start date and open date

00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:36,309
there's a whole bunch of parameters that

00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:37,659
I don't think we're ever going to change

00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:42,940
but it's nice to know that they could be

00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:47,249
changed and that allows me to mention an

00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:52,029
important point we have this flexible

00:26:47,249 --> 00:26:53,740
kind of generic model but each game is

00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:56,710
going to have data that's specific to

00:26:53,740 --> 00:27:00,220
that game and the way it's stored on the

00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:04,889
model is that the model classes all have

00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:10,210
a data property which is stored as JSON

00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:11,919
so when I create a decision the role of

00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,480
the decision the name of the decision

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,629
that's all part of those are all model

00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,220
properties but when I want to say like

00:27:15,629 --> 00:27:19,749
what the heck they decision you know

00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:23,830
with the values of the decision that's

00:27:19,749 --> 00:27:25,840
all stored as JSON so just when you know

00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:27,610
we were looking at those game settings

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:32,289
that's all JSON data that gets stored on

00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:36,039
the run so when you log in some of the

00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:37,869
queries are that for a leader it looks

00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:42,279
for what runs the leaders associated

00:27:37,869 --> 00:27:45,740
with and it creates topics there at the

00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:51,230
run level so that's model run run

00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:53,149
one model dot : model dot run - but for

00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:55,640
a player again because of the players

00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:57,799
associated with the world we want to

00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,679
know stuff about that particular run

00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:03,409
user such as what are their private

00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:06,039
scenarios and we also want to know about

00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:10,610
what worlds they belong to which is one

00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:14,960
so the topics for a player are going to

00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:16,880
be if I can get that queued up their

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,559
topics are going to be okay I want to

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,059
know anything that happens about the run

00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:22,100
user that represents this particular

00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:24,140
logged in user and I want to know

00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:26,210
anything that happens about what goes on

00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:30,890
with the world that this run users been

00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:33,200
assigned to now the thing that got me so

00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:35,980
excited about simple early on and I

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:39,049
really didn't understand it for ages is

00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:40,730
the automatic property my first blog

00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:43,850
about simple was talking about it's

00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:48,470
automatic properties so it's now time to

00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:50,059
open play in fact it is a bit late to

00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:52,130
open play it was supposed to open at

00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:54,470
11:30 but we had to silly talk we had to

00:28:52,130 --> 00:29:01,460
get through first so now I'm gonna move

00:28:54,470 --> 00:29:03,710
this run to play and boom suddenly this

00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:05,360
player gets to play there's no polling

00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:08,029
involved there's no pushing involved

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:11,720
it's fantastic I do get to create a new

00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:13,309
test if I was imaginative I call it

00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,010
something besides tests but my

00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:17,360
Adrenaline's going so I'm not going to

00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:18,919
I'll put just put two thousand one eight

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:24,740
to show that I can do something that

00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:26,450
isn't pre already in my presets so to

00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:29,510
back off a little bit and say something

00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:31,880
about this game when a player comes in

00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:37,610
here they're really simulating the

00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:40,669
Canadian children's cereal company case

00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:43,090
study each player I'll go back to the

00:29:40,669 --> 00:29:45,950
dashboard I got too excited about this

00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:48,649
so my roles I'm playing the product

00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:51,020
manager for Kellogg and there are two

00:29:48,649 --> 00:29:55,159
other product managers the competition

00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:57,679
is posting Kellogg's so my goal is to

00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:59,450
create a budget that's going to like

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,889
knock the socks off the competition

00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:01,850
their goal is to create budgets they're

00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:03,559
going to knock the socks off the

00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:06,039
competition and they all have a

00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:14,480
different case history they all have

00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:17,750
basically more or less resources and the

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:22,130
reason this game is called rules of

00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:23,889
engagement rather than Canadian serial

00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:28,279
company children's cereal company is

00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:32,779
because you define the budget for the

00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:36,440
current period but you also create rules

00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:38,899
that are going to set future budget so

00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:41,990
this game is a little weird for us

00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:43,850
because it runs over many periods but

00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:47,120
there's only one set of decisions and

00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:48,919
those decisions affect the budget that

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,220
is for the future periods but you're not

00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:53,870
creating new decisions with each period

00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:56,600
so I'm not going to mess with anything

00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:58,700
but there's all sorts of options you can

00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:02,389
keep it fixed which is the default you

00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:04,610
can react to the highest the lowest by

00:31:02,389 --> 00:31:08,570
percentages above or below whatever they

00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:21,529
did the last period and I'm going to

00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:26,179
just don't have a name so I'm going to

00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:27,620
save this and run it and I'm not going

00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:29,299
to show you how cool it is that on the

00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:31,960
model service it's saying oh I ran this

00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:34,549
but anyway I can step it through

00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,080
multiple periods and because everything

00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:41,299
was fixed it's just everything's

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:45,260
flatlined but I can also say ok that so

00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:47,029
I can create as a rules of engagement

00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:49,370
player I can create multiple test

00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:50,389
scenarios I can do what ifs this is

00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:52,309
something the professors have been

00:31:50,389 --> 00:31:53,539
asking about for years and we weren't

00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:57,190
able to give it to them with the

00:31:53,539 --> 00:32:01,370
previous simulation platform that we had

00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:03,980
and then when I'm done and I've got my

00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:06,980
best I figured out what my best deal is

00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:08,240
given my role I can then say ok I'm

00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:10,760
going to submit this as my final

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,789
decision and basically I've done

00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:16,190
everything I have to do

00:32:11,789 --> 00:32:19,229
the game as a player so at some point

00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:21,479
the time will be up and it's going to be

00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:24,840
time for the professor to debrief the

00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:29,940
pate of the students on the results of

00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:33,149
their decisions so we just moved it to

00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:35,519
debrief if you see now the user can no

00:32:33,149 --> 00:32:37,710
longer make corrections on their final

00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:41,129
decisions because the play period is

00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:44,700
over and so if we go in near here now

00:32:41,129 --> 00:32:48,299
then we see the it's only two worlds in

00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:52,889
this little test run but you can say I

00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:55,049
want to increment it like five periods

00:32:52,889 --> 00:32:57,359
and step it forward just like we did

00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:59,279
with the test scenario and there's a lot

00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:03,840
of other detail which I'm not going to

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:09,179
dig into but what I'm going to do now is

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:12,059
switch over and trusting that the talk

00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:14,029
gods are with us I just want to do a

00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:16,590
quick refresh well no it's good

00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:18,419
this actually is our production server

00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:21,059
and what we're seeing here on the top

00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:23,369
four rows are the runs from last year

00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:25,080
and what we're seeing on the bottom four

00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:29,009
rows are the empty runs that have been

00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:30,929
set up for the becoming for this

00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:42,059
semester which they will start running

00:33:30,929 --> 00:33:45,479
in net the end of next week so so I'm

00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:47,669
going to go in here and say that when we

00:33:45,479 --> 00:33:49,590
first started telling the professor that

00:33:47,669 --> 00:33:51,509
the old version because this is a

00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:53,460
reimplementation and it's an improvement

00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:56,039
on a previous version of the simulation

00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:57,599
when we told him that basically the

00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:58,830
sands of time were running out on the

00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:02,580
old version and we were going to give

00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:04,950
him a new version he said well I got a

00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:06,299
know that I can have 300 students log on

00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:09,329
at the same time in the system isn't

00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:12,450
going to choke and I got to know that if

00:34:09,329 --> 00:34:15,000
I take one of these runs which has 78

00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:18,119
students which means 26 worlds in it and

00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,750
step at five periods it'll finish in

00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:23,919
less than 10 seconds so we were nowhere

00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:27,579
near there a year ago

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:30,369
and I don't know if we're gonna be here

00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:33,489
this minute but we are here more often

00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:38,249
than not this year so here we go this is

00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:43,349
like 26 worlds all being step5 periods

00:34:38,249 --> 00:34:47,460
and I'm going to show the JavaScript

00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:50,200
because that is we see how long it took

00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:55,119
okay we ran it in six point seven six

00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:58,869
seconds and it took a a couple of

00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:01,630
seconds to refresh and one of the things

00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:06,339
you got to know is that we do a lot of

00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:08,980
stuff automatically but in order to get

00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:10,960
this response time not necessarily on

00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:14,309
the server for running the model but to

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:17,200
get the Refresh we're not waiting for

00:35:14,309 --> 00:35:18,759
this the cycle do you go to the database

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,259
and the web hook fires and then it comes

00:35:18,759 --> 00:35:21,819
back and it filters back to the Redux

00:35:20,259 --> 00:35:23,440
store and then the page wit that was

00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:27,069
like that's why they're all these

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:29,140
thrashing notices because there was a

00:35:27,069 --> 00:35:32,829
lot of thrashing and the refreshes would

00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:35,859
fail so what we do is we run it we scoop

00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:37,180
up a Jason we serialize the data and we

00:35:35,859 --> 00:35:40,630
send it back to the front-end and that's

00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:43,420
how we're doing the Refresh so now I'm

00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:47,829
going to switch back to Joe who's gonna

00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:50,400
take us home who are you

00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:50,400
there you are

00:35:55,570 --> 00:36:01,640
the moment when you hit refresh on the

00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:03,560
live demo to pray that it works that

00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:06,440
time so that was awesome awesome Jane

00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,760
thank you so where are we now so we're

00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,080
beginning work on our next simple

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,750
simulation it's already in development

00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:13,340
we've written a model for it it's

00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:15,230
another marketing simulation that we're

00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:17,030
gonna be running with the idea of

00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:19,550
delivering it into the classroom for

00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:23,150
over 200 Executive MBA students next

00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:24,710
fall we're really excited about that the

00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:27,890
repos are available they're open source

00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:30,710
github.com slash simple world we have

00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:33,590
documentation we have tutorials we have

00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:36,530
a beautiful website HTTP right there

00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:38,690
simple that world shout-out to Chad

00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:40,400
Whitman he's not here today he works at

00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:43,280
Ward computing he did an amazing job on

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:46,220
the website it looks really like totally

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,350
legit and it's so it's really really

00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:50,110
cool and we have t-shirts so that's

00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:54,680
really awesome too

00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:56,180
next up for us well we want to do this

00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,369
this is the largest talk that we've done

00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:00,830
so far we want to take this thing on the

00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:03,410
road go to other places maybe the PyCon

00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:05,690
will see but we also want to do

00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:09,560
workshops locally in the Philadelphia

00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:11,690
area at Penn we for those folks on the

00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,520
University at other schools I might want

00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:15,470
to use this so we're gonna have some

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,869
workshops they're just free workshops in

00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:20,150
the in the region and people will simple

00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:22,760
con some day we'll see but I work really

00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:24,470
excited about the prospects if you want

00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,119
to learn more about this I think we're

00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:27,710
gonna have a really few minutes for

00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:31,010
questions but you can reach out to us

00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:33,740
Learning Lab at Wharton upendi bu is the

00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:36,170
web is the email address for our team

00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:38,270
the homepage is there the github link is

00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:39,859
there if you go on the web page at the

00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:41,869
very bottom there's a place to sign up

00:37:39,859 --> 00:37:44,450
for our mailing list so we're gonna be

00:37:41,869 --> 00:37:45,950
as we build content out as you make

00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:48,440
changes as we have workshops we'll be

00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:51,050
broadcasting that information by the

00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:53,840
mailing list so I hope you got something

00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:55,730
out of this it's really exciting

00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:58,490
platform for us in a really big

00:37:55,730 --> 00:38:01,270
milestone for the Learning Lab we really

00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:04,400
think this could be you know a pretty

00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:06,530
impactful project at higher ed but also

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,930
we're really excited to see

00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:10,790
folks all the diverse folks here at

00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:12,080
Django Con and Beyond who can take it

00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:14,930
and maybe think about using it in ways

00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:16,130
that we haven't even thought of yet so

00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:19,010
that's a really exciting thing about

00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:21,020
having an open source project so thank

00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:22,370
you for your time I think we have a few

00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:29,030
questions if we have time for a few

00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:32,570
questions but yeah thank you in regards

00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:35,750
to your live demo today so I noticed you

00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:39,230
had you played for one player and the

00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:40,790
other players had results as well so how

00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:42,590
did that work and how do you deal with

00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:45,050
students who might not do their homework

00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:48,050
is that right yeah that's a that's a

00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:49,940
great question so when the students

00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:51,530
submit decisions when they do some test

00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,820
scenario they're entering decisions for

00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:55,070
all three roles and they're kind of

00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:57,590
simulating what their opponents are what

00:38:55,070 --> 00:39:00,080
their other competitors might do so when

00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:02,990
they when we provision the game and load

00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:06,470
it up we assign folks to every role in

00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:08,420
the world we create the worlds and when

00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:11,330
we when the professor moves the game to

00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:14,180
debrief and is cranking forward those

00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:16,700
worlds all the decisions for that world

00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:18,920
are being run at that by that time if

00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:21,020
someone doesn't do it the assignment

00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:23,180
there is just default behavior that's in

00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:25,850
there to prevent the model servers from

00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:27,320
blowing up yeah I was curious where you

00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:28,970
guys plan to take this next if you're

00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,530
gonna keep in the finance world or if

00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:33,890
there's other areas that you're hoping

00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:37,070
to break into yeah I think you know so

00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:39,080
right now we've given this talk at a few

00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:41,830
places at Penn I'm giving this talk at a

00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:44,540
couple universities around the

00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:46,010
Philadelphia area you know business is a

00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,930
natural fit because when I mentioned

00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:50,480
about simulations but I think that there

00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:51,710
could be simulations built around a lot

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,410
of other disciplines non-business

00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:56,750
related non finance related I could see

00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:59,270
this being really effective tool in the

00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:01,340
engineering world where simulations

00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:03,620
could be effective I could see this even

00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:06,020
liberal arts I could see this at a lot

00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:07,610
of other places I can also see it as

00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,920
well we've talked to a few folks after

00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:11,720
our talks in the research world so maybe

00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,940
using this in a research capacity in

00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:16,710
some way I could see that happening as

00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:18,720
well so really we'll see

00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:20,910
what kind of traction it gets outside of

00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,470
outside of business but I'm I'm pretty

00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:24,270
optimistic that we'll have some folks

00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:27,599
that are using this in other disciplines

00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:30,060
that we haven't seen before all right so

00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,349
thank you I will be around the rest of

00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:33,000
today and again if you've any other

00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:34,109
questions feel free to email us we'll

00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,430
share the slides out

00:40:34,109 --> 00:40:39,410
well this talk will be online so

00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:39,410
hopefully you enjoyed it thank you

00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:45,989
