Title: DjangoCon US 2018 - Finally Understand Authentication in Django REST Framework by William S. Vincent
Publication date: 2018-11-08
Playlist: DjangoCon US 2018
Description: 
	Traditional Django handles user authentication for us. REST Framework? Not so much. The abundance of choice is overwhelming and typically THE biggest obstacle for newcomers.

This talk is a deep dive on authentication in Django REST Framework. We‚Äôll start with an overview of HTTP and REST APIs before demonstrating how to implement the 4 built-in auth modes and their respective pros/cons. Special attention will be paid to common gotchas such as, Why do I need ‚Äúboth‚Äù TokenAuth and SessionAuth? What are JWTs?

Next we‚Äôll implement a real-world REST auth setup that includes user registration, password reset/confirm, social auth, and endpoints for sign up, log in, and log out. The third-party packages django-rest-auth and django-allauth will be used .

By the end of the talk attendees will understand the basics of REST authentication, the tradeoffs involved, and walk away with a working implementation to jumpstart their future projects.
