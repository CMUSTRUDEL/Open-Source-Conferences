Description: 
	DjangoCon US 2018 - Bespoke communication devices for kids with autism built with Django and Raspberry Pi by Muriel Green

This talk will detail my experience building an Augmentative Alternative Communication (AAC) device for my son who has autism. I had to perform some troubleshooting to get Django to harmonize with the Raspbian OS and touchscreen drivers, but the result is easily replicable using the instructions I will cover from my project documentation on the Hackaday website bit.ly/TalkerHackaday

I want to give this talk to inspire other developers to try their hand at building bespoke assistive devices. Commercially available medical assistive devices are expensive partly because they try to be everything to everybody. What if instead, we made products that do one thing for one specific user very well?

This outline shows what I will cover in my talk:

Find a need and fill it
Django on Linux
Interface prototyping
Gesture recognition for touchscreen
Custom enclosures with NO 3D printing
Everyone needs to become an inventor
This talk is for people who are curious about running Django in an embedded system (development server as the production environment). People who are interested in Debian Linux will also find this talk interesting. I would love to reach the autism community and people who want to build assistive technology. To get the most out of this talk, attendees should have a basic knowledge of how to perform a command line Django installation and what a raspberry pi is.

[Music]

00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,460
thank you for coming to see my talk and

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,340
thank you for being so welcoming to me

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:27,930
since I'm basically a hobbyist and this

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:29,310
is a passion project so I I feel certain

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,960
that most of the people in this room

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,550
know more about Django than me and I'm

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,610
going to take advantage of that during

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:37,140
the question and answer session to pick

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,640
your brains to try to solve some of the

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:47,520
problems that I'm running into with this

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:49,170
project to begin the the what I put on

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,879
my name badge for the conference and

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:55,469
what I feel like are my qualifications

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:59,070
for this presentation are that I'm I

00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,809
call myself a mom and inventor but I

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,149
don't think that those are requirements

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,610
to do a project like this what I mean

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,320
when I say that is really just that the

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,500
only qualifications that I have are that

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,320
I was passionate about this problem and

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,119
curious enough to keep trying to find

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:21,799
ways to solve it every time I would run

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:25,380
into an obstacle one of my children

00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:29,340
Malcolm has autism with language delay

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:32,759
and he has been in speech therapy since

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:36,320
he was two and he's seven now he still

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:42,479
has a really hard time forming words and

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:47,640
he uses a tablet type device at school

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:49,770
to communicate and so really that's

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:55,530
where my passion for the project came

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:59,430
from was trying to find a way to help

00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:02,280
him and to also help other parents that

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:07,350
we're facing the same sort of situation

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:10,530
because I don't I don't know which slide

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:12,270
it's on here but the the devices that

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,950
are available on the market are really

00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,800
expensive the one that

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:21,920
we were recommended to get is just over

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:24,269
six thousand US dollars and when I was

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,629
trying to figure out how we were gonna

00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:30,060
buy this I was googling thinking well

00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:32,250
surely somebody's got like a knockoff

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,230
version or like a generic version or an

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,720
open-source version and there wasn't

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:39,660
that I could find and so that's how this

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,959
all started was I just want there to be

00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,459
a version that people can do themselves

00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:45,720
their hat there has to be an alternative

00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:47,160
there has to be a version that people

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,630
can make themselves that they're not

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:54,780
pressured into spending this money so a

00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:58,200
C stands for augmentative and

00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:01,349
alternative communication device and I

00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:05,280
had never heard of them before except in

00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:09,810
with regards to Stephen Hawking who used

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:13,079
a speech generating device to speak

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,540
towards the end of his life and there's

00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:17,610
this clip from The Simpsons where he

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,760
appears that I think is really great and

00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,230
this so I'm gonna ladies Gemini must

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,569
apologize this man does not speak for

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,160
the Council of alphas we hold you sub

00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:27,600
Omega Lloyd's in the highest regard

00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,790
where we gonna get broccoli juice

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,980
program we're putting in please your IQ

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:35,730
is a mere 155 while mine is a muscular

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:38,489
1/7 I and smart much smarter than you

00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:50,940
Hobart you should all do what I say my

00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:53,190
IQ is 199 for crying out plain 98 97 the

00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:56,549
world's smartest man what are you doing

00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:59,549
here I wanted to see your utopia but now

00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:01,950
I see it as more of a fruit total I'm

00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:04,290
sure would dr. Hawking means his silence

00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:07,019
I don't need anyone to talk for me

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:10,190
except this noise talks you have clearly

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,190
been corrupted by power

00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,890
I don't know which is a bigger

00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:24,500
disappointment my failure to formulate a

00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:27,580
unified field theory like your tone you

00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,580
found it yeah

00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:35,540
[Music]

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,589
[Applause]

00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,620
[Music]

00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:14,440
Lisa thank god you're okay did you have

00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:21,640
fun with your robot buddy we had such a

00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:25,000
beautiful dream of us can be the most

00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:27,460
childish even you know not me

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,830
never I guess everyone has a different

00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:43,360
vision for the perfect world Oh mom

00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:47,140
that's very profound this intriguing

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,150
Homer I may have to steal it wow I can't

00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,250
believe someone I never heard of he's

00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:54,960
hanging out with a guy like me alright

00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,960
it's closing time who's paying again

00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:09,550
[Music]

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,770
alright so when my son was diagnosed

00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:13,480
with autism with language delay and his

00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:16,240
speech therapist said we need to get a

00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,920
talking machine I thought okay cool

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,990
it'll be like he'll be like Stephen

00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:24,130
Hawking and so it turns out there are a

00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,260
lot of different kinds of speech

00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,480
generating devices and some of them are

00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:32,920
specifically geared toward preschool age

00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:36,780
kids and they use icons or cartoon like

00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:43,450
symbols instead of text-to-speech or

00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:47,280
typing and the reason the reason that

00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:50,020
these machines are cool is because it

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,410
assumes a high level of competence from

00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:55,690
the children it's possible to just have

00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:57,640
like some laminated index cards that you

00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:00,970
keep on a keychain in your pocket to do

00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:05,110
rudimentary communication with with

00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:06,610
people who who don't know you but how

00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:09,220
many cards can you really keep in your

00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:11,260
pocket if you've got a digital device

00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:14,890
then you could have tens of thousands of

00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:16,540
words at your disposal and the his

00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:18,370
speech therapist was really keen on that

00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,080
because she wanted to give him as many

00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:22,419
opportunities to express himself

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:26,259
possible instead of starting out with a

00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:28,330
limited vocabulary and also these

00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:30,610
machines in general are customizable you

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,849
can mask out different icons if you only

00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:35,050
use certain ones or you can put in

00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:40,449
pictures that are specific to your

00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:42,610
family but they are really expensive so

00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:45,969
when I was thinking about this problem

00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:49,810
how there are these really expensive

00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:53,770
medical devices that are people need and

00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:57,729
I was looking around my house I noticed

00:07:53,770 --> 00:08:00,819
that we have all these toys that that do

00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:04,500
generate speech and so I I did a little

00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:04,500
demo here of a few of them

00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,120
[Music]

00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:48,700
[Music]

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:53,650
turns white when they're from this this

00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:55,660
LeapPad toy in particular three Malcolm

00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,400
taught himself the whole alphabet and

00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,810
all the animals all the names of the

00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,510
animals are how to spell the names of

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:06,910
the animals with that thing so that was

00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:14,290
a good toy but it was like less than

00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:18,280
thirty dollars and so that's what I just

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:19,810
keep coming back to is this idea what's

00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:23,470
the difference between a toy and a

00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:28,150
medical device and the main difference

00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:32,380
that I can see is that the the speech

00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:37,330
therapy devices primarily the the words

00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:40,150
are the words are mostly nouns no mostly

00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:43,360
verbs mostly like a toy the the words

00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:46,660
are mostly verb I'm so nervous

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,460
on toys the words are mostly nouns like

00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:51,910
the names of animals or the names of

00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:55,030
colors and then in the speech therapy

00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:57,880
devices it's mostly verbs because that's

00:09:55,030 --> 00:10:06,030
what that's what people use to speak in

00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:08,290
in natural language and so this idea

00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:10,150
that was the basis of this project is

00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:14,340
just imagine if every child could have

00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:14,340
an AAC is affordable and rugged as a toy

00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:24,370
so I said about building one and I used

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:26,120
Jango and I wrote I wrote some source

00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:29,240
code which is available on get

00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,480
and then for the hardware I was I was

00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,249
basically doing everything I could to

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,509
avoid just making an app I'm trying to

00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:37,910
make this an embedded system a

00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:39,769
standalone device so I used a Raspberry

00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:44,240
Pi with touchscreen and speakers and

00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:45,980
battery and in the Django girls tutorial

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,410
there is some really helpful

00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:51,499
troubleshooting for installing Django on

00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:53,240
Debian so I wanted to highlight that

00:10:51,499 --> 00:10:54,649
because that is an error that occurs

00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,689
when you're trying to load django on a

00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:59,720
Raspberry Pi and then what I wind up

00:10:56,689 --> 00:11:04,089
doing is just running the development

00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:06,740
server as of the production environment

00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:08,480
so here's the here's the part where I

00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:14,329
start asking you for help this is

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:16,309
currently what I have and it seems to

00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:18,980
work pretty well on Chrome but it

00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:20,240
doesn't work in other browsers and so I

00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,220
think there might be some sort of

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,389
JavaScript thing that I'm doing wrong so

00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:28,399
if anybody wants to make a pull request

00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:31,550
about that I would love it it's just

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:38,629
basically looping through a dictionary

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:40,550
of of JPEGs and then onmousedown

00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:43,249
whenever you touch them on the touch

00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:49,249
screen it plays a an Associated mp3 file

00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:56,949
so my github username is amendment 19 if

00:11:49,249 --> 00:12:01,990
anybody wants to go look at the repo and

00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:04,990
here I'm going to talk through a little

00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,990
demo

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,769
so you can see the the microUSB is where

00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:20,689
the Raspberry Pi gets power and then

00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:22,809
there are their regular USB slots the SD

00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:28,729
card is where the operating system

00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:30,470
resides and in order to do all this

00:12:28,729 --> 00:12:35,049
setup you have to plug in a keyboard and

00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:37,939
mouse there is a way to add your

00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:39,919
reference your the script that you want

00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:43,100
to execute on startup in the RC local

00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:45,019
file and then specify it to run in kiosk

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,609
modes so that it'll just automatically

00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:51,139
start running your app whenever you

00:12:46,609 --> 00:12:55,600
power it on and then that white thing is

00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:58,789
the battery that I found on Adafruit and

00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,489
the 3.5 millimeter jack is the default

00:12:58,789 --> 00:13:04,009
sound output for the Raspberry Pi but

00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:05,720
I've I can't get the sound to be very

00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:08,529
loud and when I've been researching this

00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:11,299
it sounds like it's a generally accepted

00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:13,609
blonde the system that that sport is

00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:16,429
kind of underpowered so you can't get

00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:19,759
the sound very loud of it I've been

00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:22,220
trying to create an amplifier that would

00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,959
let me use stereo enclosed speakers but

00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:27,829
it adds a lot of bulk to the project

00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:33,109
also I've looked at shields that would

00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:35,029
go on like am hat or or other Raspberry

00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:37,879
Pi shields that have an amplifier in

00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:39,799
them but it's interfering with the pins

00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:41,539
that are used for the touchscreen so if

00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:42,769
anybody is into hardware tinkering and

00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:45,279
you have some ideas on how I could

00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:50,149
improve that I would definitely all ears

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:51,769
this just shows what's in the the cloned

00:13:50,149 --> 00:13:54,409
project folder are the same things that

00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:56,149
are usually in a Django project and then

00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:59,859
in this part of the demo I'm just

00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:59,859
spinning up the development server

00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:21,250
and it seems to be pretty stable I just

00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:23,589
run the development server on the

00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:28,839
Raspberry Pi and it works fine for as

00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:30,670
long as I'm using it so since it's a

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,770
self-contained system I'm not really

00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:35,980
very worried about a threat model it's

00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:39,550
mostly just will it will it work without

00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:42,540
failing and it seems to be working just

00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,540
fine for what I'm using it for

00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:31,079
and this is a Raspberry Pi 3 so it comes

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,079
with Wi-Fi built-in so I was able to

00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,879
so I was able to pip install Jango

00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:52,350
easily the first time I tried to build

00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,779
it I tried to build it on Raspberry Pi 2

00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:56,970
which does not come with Wi-Fi and I

00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:58,470
thought oh I can just copy over every

00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:01,920
single one of those little tiny files

00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:04,110
those little tiny egg files from from

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,939
Django and that didn't that didn't ever

00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:07,740
work

00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:09,389
if anybody knows a way to do that I'm

00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:14,399
still I'm still curious as to why I

00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:15,509
couldn't get it to work but so I made I

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:21,420
don't know if we have time to show the

00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:24,449
contest video I was looking for a

00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:28,470
deadline like an enforced deadline and

00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:31,110
so I entered the the hackaday prize

00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:33,449
competition last year which had a whole

00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:38,399
segment of assistive technology projects

00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:41,699
and it was really fun and I didn't make

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,649
it into the semi finals but I did meet a

00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:45,689
lot of people who were also working on

00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:48,899
assistive technology projects and the

00:16:45,689 --> 00:16:50,459
community community there is is really

00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:53,639
neat there are lots of people who are

00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:57,179
willing to help and so if you want to

00:16:53,639 --> 00:17:00,329
find me on hackaday my user name is

00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:02,550
Muriel G and if you're interested in

00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:05,669
building your own hardware software

00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:07,860
projects they have that contest every

00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:09,480
year and there are cash prizes and there

00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,880
are also there's also like a fellowship

00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:16,740
for the grand prize so it's I mean like

00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:21,600
there's a a prizes that are really

00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:25,289
exciting and worth winning ok so I want

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:27,270
to demo the interface really quick like

00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:31,409
I said it it seems to work better in

00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:33,210
Chrome so if you want to look at it on

00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:35,309
your phone this is live on Python

00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:45,929
anywhere Muriel G dot Python anywhere

00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:49,380
calm and and so these these icons are I

00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:53,710
dry drew them but I copied them from a

00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:55,590
speech therapy icon set called unity so

00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:57,580
like I was saying they're mostly verbs

00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:59,700
because they're designed to help

00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:03,370
children learn how to put together

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:07,690
syntactically correct language so the

00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:10,240
icons aren't they're really abstract but

00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:15,970
the the kids get used to I'm like this

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:18,700
bucket of water is just means is and

00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:22,440
then this the bucket of water that's in

00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:24,700
the process of spilling over were and

00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:34,630
then the bucket of water that already

00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:43,920
spilled was and then more everyday

00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:43,920
concepts work have deal

00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:55,400
so I I have a I have a prototype as

00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,440
you've seen in the video but it's a

00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,050
works like prototype so it's pretty ugly

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:03,320
and I'm trying to find ways to make it

00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:05,300
smaller and I've tried a lot of

00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:08,960
different ways to build enclosures for

00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:11,300
it I I'm not very good at 3d printing or

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,100
designing things on Tinkercad so I

00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,690
didn't want to spend a whole lot of time

00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:18,880
learning a whole nother skill set just

00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:22,070
to build an enclosure so I actually

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,360
built enclosures out of Legos and just

00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,710
super glued them together and that

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,480
worked really well because it was way

00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:33,830
faster I could iterate way faster and

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:35,360
also sewing like stuffed animals like

00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:42,770
just kind of stuffing it into a stuffed

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:45,160
animal that that worked well too so one

00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:47,330
of my main goals with this talk was to

00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:50,300
encourage people who already have

00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:52,670
developer skills to choose passion

00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:55,310
projects or portfolio pieces that are

00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:58,490
assistive in some way according to the

00:19:55,310 --> 00:20:00,170
2010 census nearly 19% of the civilian

00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,210
non-institutionalized population of

00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:07,310
America lives with some sort of

00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:12,070
disability so here the numbers 56

00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:17,870
million people have a disability

00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:20,180
according to the census and 12% of the

00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:21,920
population are living with a severe

00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:24,620
disability that impacts their ability to

00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:29,120
do day-to-day activities that a lot of

00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:31,220
people take for granted and so I feel

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,810
fairly certain that everybody in this

00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:35,930
room already knows someone with a

00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:37,430
disability and so I would encourage you

00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:39,770
to think about how you can use your

00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:41,090
skills to help just talk to them and

00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:48,230
find out what they need and then just

00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:50,510
make it yeah I think my only reference

00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:52,460
was the the census citation there if you

00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:55,190
want to look that up and if you want to

00:20:52,460 --> 00:21:00,350
get in touch with me here's my email and

00:20:55,190 --> 00:21:01,860
github and hackaday profile and I be

00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:09,210
happy to take questions

00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:10,529
for the rest of the time hey first of

00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:14,909
all I thought that was an incredible

00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:17,039
talk thank you and this may already be a

00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:19,559
suggestion which is going against your

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:24,179
request of it to staying within Python

00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:28,980
so helpful there is a JavaScript library

00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:30,179
called p5.js which is the most recent

00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:33,480
version of something that was originally

00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:36,269
kind of on top of Java called literally

00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:40,200
processing okay which is a terrible name

00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:44,539
because just google processing things

00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:48,720
but it was it's been used for

00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:51,899
interactions visual audio okay

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:55,590
and the p5 new version is trying to be

00:21:51,899 --> 00:22:00,269
much more mobile I don't know how well

00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:02,250
that would apply to a Raspberry Pi I

00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:07,380
would have thought interface wise that

00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:10,799
would be applicable but it's also if the

00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:14,370
possibility of having a I guess a

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:17,460
website that could clickable outside

00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:19,950
just a handheld thing that's a library

00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:23,700
that might be worth having a peek at

00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:25,380
okay yeah and I would be more than happy

00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,510
to show you some stuff that I've done

00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,840
with that yeah excellent you should give

00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:32,639
me your email address and I'm not

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,399
totally averse to making this into an

00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:37,139
app or a mobile site I really liked the

00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:38,549
Kivi presentation yesterday I don't know

00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:41,880
if that guy's in here but I'm gonna look

00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:45,120
into that too so p5 also thank you sure

00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:47,190
I'm just wondering if we're gonna go

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,440
about like you know addressing some of

00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:53,370
these issues what are some places that

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,740
we can find like resources or just like

00:22:53,370 --> 00:23:00,299
maybe places where people have like

00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:02,090
voiced needs in this community and like

00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:05,100
where things aren't being addressed

00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:08,220
necessarily like I know you said in your

00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:13,289
talk there was something like there

00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:14,730
wasn't like actually but anyway sorry

00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:15,450
totally forgot what I was gonna say but

00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,740
yeah is

00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,450
any like places where we could go to

00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,309
find out like needs that aren't being

00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:24,090
addressed or they're just like it's only

00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:25,769
one product out there I'm trying to

00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:27,330
think of the people who are the

00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:32,610
organizations that were encouraging to

00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:38,519
me support groups like parent support

00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:45,179
groups also there's a speech therapy

00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:47,909
organization called Asha and my both of

00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:50,480
my younger son's went to a speech

00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:53,580
therapy preschool so I know there are

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,590
those exist preschools that are

00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,000
specifically for actually I think a lot

00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:59,789
of public schools have special ed

00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,850
preschools in in the public school too

00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:09,649
because of they start providing services

00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:11,970
at age three because of the idea act

00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:15,510
what sort of feedback have you gotten

00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:19,710
from your son in comparison to like the

00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:24,929
$6000 devices yeah he's he's my he's my

00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:28,080
tester he and really the the most

00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:31,649
exciting thing about this project is its

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:36,899
he's more interested in the hardware now

00:24:31,649 --> 00:24:38,100
so it's almost turning into like I would

00:24:36,899 --> 00:24:41,909
love for it to be the sort of thing that

00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:45,320
he can see what I'm doing and then do

00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:47,490
something better himself someday like I

00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:49,289
that's why I want to stick with the

00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:52,289
Raspberry Pi instead of like getting

00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:55,889
smaller and doing like an hour toss

00:24:52,289 --> 00:24:58,350
based board with a dedicated

00:24:55,889 --> 00:25:00,630
microcontroller because I would love for

00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:03,630
it to be the sort of thing that autistic

00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:04,889
people can do themselves and just have

00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:06,679
the instructions out there on the

00:25:04,889 --> 00:25:09,000
internet that are really easy to follow

00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:11,010
alright and on behalf of a very thankful

00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,810
conference thank you so might send you

00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:18,669
home with some treats

00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:18,669
