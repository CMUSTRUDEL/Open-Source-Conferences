	DjangoCon US 2018 - Building a Community for All People by Jennifer Konikowski

Are you having trouble getting beginners to stick around in your user group? Whatâ€™s the best way to help people who are just getting started with Django and Python? Are you finding it difficult to attract and keep a diverse audience? Since I started PyLadies Boston in 2013, Iâ€™ve learned a few lessons about the best way to help out beginners and cultivate a welcoming community for marginalized folks. In this talk, I will cover:

Starting a group with the intention to be beginner-friendly
Creating a welcoming environment
Beginner friendly meeting topics
Finding the best way to teach people to code
Being a good ally

This talk will benefit anyone who is currently running or thinking of starting a user group.
