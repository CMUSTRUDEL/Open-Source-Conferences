	DjangoCon US 2018 - Building a Community for All People by Jennifer Konikowski

Are you having trouble getting beginners to stick around in your user group? Whatâ€™s the best way to help people who are just getting started with Django and Python? Are you finding it difficult to attract and keep a diverse audience? Since I started PyLadies Boston in 2013, Iâ€™ve learned a few lessons about the best way to help out beginners and cultivate a welcoming community for marginalized folks. In this talk, I will cover:

Starting a group with the intention to be beginner-friendly
Creating a welcoming environment
Beginner friendly meeting topics
Finding the best way to teach people to code
Being a good ally

This talk will benefit anyone who is currently running or thinking of starting a user group.

This talk was presented at: https://2018.djangocon.us/talk/building-a-community-for-all-people/

00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,390
so as this says this is really how to

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,519
make your group super accessible to

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,840
people learning to code and why it's

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,420
important to have user groups for

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,250
minority groups in tech all combined

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,140
into one 25 minutes if you want to

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,380
follow along the slides there @jm connie

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,000
comm slash building community so i'm

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,600
jennifer chronic Kowski j i'm connie in

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,670
most places at GenCon e on twitter and

00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,620
i'm a software engineer at six fix and

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,390
founder of pi ladies boston a python

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,890
user group for women and gender queer

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,660
individuals that has grown to over a

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,370
thousand members since moving to

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,530
Pittsburgh last April

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,039
I'm usually found a girl develop its

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,649
code and cotton coffee monthly meetups

00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,809
so when I would go to user groups as a

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,600
newer developer it was very intimidating

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:06,420
people seem to know each other and I

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,450
wasn't sure who to ask for help I also

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,479
was usually surrounded by all or mostly

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,010
men and I wanted a smaller group where I

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,040
could talk to other women who had

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,200
similar goals to myself which is why I

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,240
ended up starting pilotis Boston I mean

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,780
and to make friends with awesome Python

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:28,500
people so why would I create an

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,210
exclusive group so this is a quote

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,130
what's read out it turns out that

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,590
communities exist for a variety of

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,600
reasons some of which have nothing to do

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,640
with explaining themselves a cause a

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,259
technology or a gender to the rest of

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,720
the world and this is selena deckle men

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,880
who is one of the organizers of pilotis

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,950
portland she wrote this in response to

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,320
the question why are there so many women

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,020
in tech groups groups can celebrate our

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,630
similarities but also ways in which

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,180
we're different and sometimes that

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,860
similarity might be Python or Django and

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,159
sometimes it might be narrowed down even

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:05,219
further to women who program in Python

00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:08,599
so why narrow down to begin with because

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:11,940
often when you're the minority you feel

00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:13,380
less confident because you're different

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,020
which makes you less

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,490
likely to speak up part of this can be

00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,800
the feeling that you are representing

00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,720
your group when you speak and being

00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,730
overly concerned about saying something

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,610
that would be considered unintelligent

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,560
saij sharp address this in the context

00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,450
of applying for jobs in their talk

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,370
herding cats with Django yesterday and

00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,490
y'all should maybe go watch that as soon

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,860
as it's posted if you didn't see it so

00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:40,710
all so different life experiences are

00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,710
exasperated and when everyone's life

00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:45,030
experiences are a bit different

00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,950
sorry while everyone's life experiences

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,220
are a bit different when you're a

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,880
different gender sex race or orientation

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,840
the differences tend to be amplified in

00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,690
conversation it can sometimes feel like

00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,130
others aren't interested in your

00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,900
particular experiences or like you don't

00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,640
have anything in common and this often

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,400
has nothing to do with how others are

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,660
behaving it can often just be a feeling

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,940
and oftentimes other people will assume

00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,740
you're just there with a friend or don't

00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,140
have the same level of knowledge that

00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:19,800
they do this is especially true the more

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:22,170
visibly you stand out I'm in particular

00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,150
with women in men's spaces and

00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,550
particular very femme presenting women

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,800
this leads to people speaking to you in

00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:33,030
a condescending way even though this can

00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:35,010
often be completely unintentional so

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,870
that's what being different does it

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,330
makes you aware of your actions and that

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,700
you might be imposing it's so minor but

00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,860
it adds up this is by Ellen Kisa

00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,020
who at the time of writing this was a

00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,580
project product manager at Kickstarter

00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,190
and one of the very few women in her

00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,900
department in the Post quoted she talks

00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,790
about her co-workers mostly young dads

00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,620
inviting her out to lunch and working

00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:58,740
hard to include her but she still felt

00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:02,820
out of place right so why bother

00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:05,310
focusing on beginners so diverse teams

00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,840
are smarter straight up and we want to

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,670
ensure that our communities are open to

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,190
beginners because we need to expand and

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:13,290
diversify women and minorities are more

00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:15,330
likely to learn to program later in life

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:18,390
and the more diverse our community is

00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:20,520
the more diverse our teams will be so

00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,740
Harvard Business Review wrote this

00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,390
amazing post and one of their

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,950
conclusions was that working with people

00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,690
who are different from you

00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,700
challenge your brain to overcome its

00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,820
sale ways of thinking and sharpen its

00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:35,430
performance and who doesn't want a sharp

00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:38,310
brain everyone should be able to learn

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,840
to program programming shouldn't just be

00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,730
limited to people who are proven

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,580
privileged enough to learn to code in

00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:47,400
grade school or be able to select

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:50,520
computer science degree in college or go

00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,950
to college even so we need to be open to

00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,320
helping people learn no matter their age

00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,940
gender or background if someone wants to

00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,890
join our community we should be open

00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,260
helping them learn having community to

00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:03,060
help learn should not only be open to

00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,940
people willing to pay thousands of

00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:09,510
dollars for a code school or a boot camp

00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:11,460
all right so now hopefully you get the

00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:14,820
why and hopefully you're sold on why

00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:16,980
it's important so how can you do your

00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,200
best to make sure your group is open to

00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:22,560
beginners and how can you be an ally to

00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:25,440
marginalize people in your community so

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,940
first let's talk about user groups some

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,380
of these will be easily easier to

00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,540
implement if you're starting a new group

00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,610
but considering making but consider

00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,430
making changes if you're a part of the

00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:38,010
leadership team for an existing group

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,960
also secret if you aren't on the

00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:42,000
leadership team and see one of these

00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,130
ideas that you think would benefit your

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,650
local group reach out to the leadership

00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:50,720
team and volunteer because most groups

00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:52,860
would love more volunteers alright so

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,050
one of the first things you can do is

00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,860
make sure you describe your group and

00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:00,720
events as beginner inclusive ideally if

00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,090
they are beginner inclusive if you're

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,050
only having really high level talks make

00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:08,850
it extremely clear but here's an example

00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:12,870
no problem too big or small good for

00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:15,000
people of all levels and just be very

00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,160
clear about your descriptions be clear

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,560
what about what knowledge and skills are

00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,480
required so people will often

00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,320
underestimate themselves so keep this in

00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:27,690
mind when describing what's needed so

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,850
example basic Python required should

00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:33,630
have mostly completed a tutorial like

00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:37,830
learn Python the hard way find out what

00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:39,389
your local community actually needs you

00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:43,379
know what kind of

00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:46,169
companies are around you do you have a

00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:49,860
lot of academics maybe you want to have

00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:51,539
some CyHi tutorials you know this is

00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:55,289
very important because every community

00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:57,389
needs different things in Boston we had

00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:59,729
a large community and I go to academics

00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:02,490
and scientist so there was a huge desire

00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:05,580
for tutorials and code reviews but with

00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:09,689
Boston Ruby women so I'm actually a

00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:12,330
rails developer we have a lot of we had

00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:13,259
a lot of recent bootcamp grads and so we

00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:17,159
spent more time talking about

00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:20,759
interviewing and finding jobs you want

00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:22,919
to ask for feedback constantly like

00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:26,219
don't want to annoy your members but at

00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:27,840
least once a year so like when I was

00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:29,669
running pilings Boston every year I had

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,710
an anniversary party and asked everyone

00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:33,900
who attended for feedback on the past

00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:35,819
year you know what did they like what

00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:39,319
did they not like and four suggestions

00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:42,150
in the future and the regular evaluation

00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:43,500
really helped us have new types of

00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,900
events that I wouldn't have thought of

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,080
on my own and got rid of ones that I

00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:52,440
thought were great ideas that just

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,750
totally bombed so and you also want to

00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,250
try a lot of different types so

00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,779
depending on your local community some

00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,550
may work better for you than others and

00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:01,589
here are some event types that I've had

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:05,460
success with most obvious is

00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:06,900
presentation nights but often there's an

00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,449
idea that you have to be an expert to

00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,430
give a presentation so make it clear

00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:12,539
when asking for presentations that

00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:15,719
you're open to presentations about

00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:17,909
beginner projects as well

00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:19,860
enlightening talks are a great way to

00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:21,870
get people to do their first public talk

00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,990
and one of the ways that I've encouraged

00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:28,349
people is to say that while it should

00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,490
maybe be related related if you have

00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:31,050
hobby that you want to share with

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:33,060
everyone we'd love to hear a lightning

00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,740
talk on it so one of the members of Pi

00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,079
ladies ended up doing her very first

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,969
presentation ever on bird-watching and

00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:43,560
it was a huge hit and her next talk was

00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:45,149
technical so tutorials were very

00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,920
successful for us and this is one of the

00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:49,350
things that's often harder for much

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:53,280
larger user groups but I sort of want to

00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:55,860
push you to consider it

00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,480
because they give an experience they

00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,670
have experience people a chance to share

00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,100
their knowledge in a meaningful way and

00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:05,490
more inexperienced people a chance to

00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,440
learn a new skill or toolset

00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,750
however with tutorials it's key to allow

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,000
for extra time in the beginning or

00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,190
before the event to get set up even if

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,150
you have really clear instructions and

00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:20,430
ask people to set up prior they'll still

00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:23,700
need extra time because people won't do

00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,650
it so one of the things we started doing

00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,020
that was really fun and in a way I

00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:30,510
wasn't expecting was mob programming and

00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,680
so the whole group looks at the same

00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,890
problem and tries to solve it together

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,570
occasionally this is done in offices but

00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:39,630
I actually found that it's fun to do as

00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:41,070
a group so we started running events

00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,830
that were a combination of mob

00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:46,140
programming and code reviews so everyone

00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:48,600
can participate so even with limited

00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,250
programming knowledge you can get an

00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,160
idea of what kinds of problems other

00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,930
people are facing and great and often

00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,030
time if you're the organizer you might

00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,589
end up having to put some of your code

00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,600
up because people will be too nervous

00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:01,080
but then after you get your code torn to

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,780
shreds

00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:08,970
so one also be like oh well that's not

00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:10,890
that bad you know okay so you also want

00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:13,200
to consider hosting separate beginner

00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:15,270
focused events so these events will draw

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,440
out people who are still too intimidated

00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:21,780
to go to the main meetings so we even

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,339
for just PI ladies we had women show up

00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,320
to beginner events that would never go

00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:28,530
to the main group even though the main

00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,210
group was still focused on beginners but

00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:32,370
they were still working through the

00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:36,030
tutorial and weren't sure that they

00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:41,339
would feel that they were ready to go to

00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:43,140
the larger group so you can host events

00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:45,900
like study groups which can help people

00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:47,310
teach each other so we tried to have

00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,080
study groups every week and have a

00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:51,570
mentor each time which is a little

00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,430
aggressive and definitely very hard to

00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:55,680
do so I don't want to say you have to do

00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:57,270
that but we've also encouraged our

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,060
members to start study groups in their

00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:03,209
neighborhoods as well and have had a ton

00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:05,160
of success with that I've used these to

00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:06,310
target people who are just starting to

00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,069
learn to code

00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:12,490
and if you're trying to provide mentors

00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:14,199
at study groups it can be a challenge

00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:16,120
but one way to sell it to your more

00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:17,170
experienced members is that it's a way

00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,519
to both share their knowledge and

00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,860
improve their understanding of the

00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:22,809
fundamentals I have one woman who comes

00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:25,899
every week and she always challenges me

00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:27,579
and makes me go deeper into the language

00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:29,649
than I had before and definitely one of

00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:34,209
the things I really miss about living in

00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:36,399
Boston and we also had mentorships

00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:39,009
mentor sessions which were similar to

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,589
study groups but more focused on career

00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:44,230
growth so they were targeting people who

00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:46,600
knew how to code but we're looking to

00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:50,499
enter the industry and job hunting as a

00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:52,120
junior is extremely discouraging and so

00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:54,220
it really helped to have regular

00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,829
meetings with someone who tells you that

00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,360
you can do it and also by getting to

00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:01,149
know a larger amount of junior

00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,680
developers it makes it easier for you to

00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:05,050
find great developers who just haven't

00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,519
been given a chance yet so frequently

00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,230
it's harder to get to know people in the

00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:10,629
larger group setting and having a

00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:12,790
smaller subset like a mentor session can

00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:14,350
help you're more experienced members get

00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,990
to know the individuals who are just

00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:19,360
getting started

00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:21,639
so when really this is the thing that

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,129
every group should do and it's really

00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:26,500
easy if you're using Meetup

00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:28,809
send an email to everyone who joins with

00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,269
a message that emphasizes that everyone

00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:32,889
is welcome no matter what their level of

00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:35,129
experience is and let them know what

00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:38,800
they can expect to happen at your event

00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:40,569
so with meetup you write it once and

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:45,339
just have it send automatically it's

00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:49,120
fantastic if you can have someone to

00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:51,189
greet people when they walk in ideally

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,379
it's one of the organizers or someone

00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:55,179
who's there regularly and this

00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:57,370
individual should do their best to get

00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:59,259
to know people who have just joined it

00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:01,360
will give all newcomers a friendly face

00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:03,819
each time they return and someone who is

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,370
familiar with their level so with hi

00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:08,589
ladies this was basically me because

00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,029
even when we got larger it was never too

00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:16,750
large so and I was there every single

00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:18,699
month so but people saw me and we're

00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,779
familiar and felt a little bit I could

00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:22,180
tell like the

00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:23,860
in month they came they felt much much

00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:28,959
more secure because they're like oh I

00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:32,230
know someone this is fine um consider

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,629
like if you're a larger group having an

00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:39,040
event that's just for a marginalized

00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:41,050
group so it does require you to have a

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,529
member of that marginalized group who's

00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:47,620
interested in hosting it so one way to

00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:49,809
do this is to host an event like and all

00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,819
the nerdy ladies my friend Pamela

00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:54,339
Vickers started doing all the nerdy

00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:55,930
ladies in Atlanta as a way to get people

00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:58,870
from all these different like women and

00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:02,139
tech groups together and you could

00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:04,629
easily talk to maybe some other user

00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:06,610
groups and be like hey like you know let

00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:08,620
let's work together you know get the

00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,910
women from our group together and it can

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,309
help encourage women to attend the

00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:14,439
larger meetups as well and get feedback

00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:16,709
as to why they weren't coming to the

00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:20,649
main meetups in the first place

00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:22,420
so for presentation nights you want to

00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:24,699
ensure that there are regular talks that

00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:27,699
are suitable for beginners doesn't have

00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:30,089
to be like every single time but usually

00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:33,250
maybe you have like two to three

00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:35,920
presentations have one of those be a

00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,449
little bit more entry level and they

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,970
don't have to be you know how to write a

00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:42,309
for loop but more here's a problem this

00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:44,290
is how I salt it and with less of an

00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:47,949
emphasis on like deep dives into the

00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:50,529
language organizers I spoke to said they

00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:52,300
got large influxes of new signups for

00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:56,860
nights when they had multiple speakers

00:14:52,300 --> 00:15:00,970
from a variety of fields and so a few

00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:03,040
suggestions for project nights have a

00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:06,100
couple of beginner tables that are

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,709
clearly marked and preferably have a few

00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,100
experienced programmers to staff them

00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:15,250
and help new people work through issues

00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:17,290
so as soon as someone comes in you know

00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,569
the greeter should be able to point out

00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:21,670
that table if the person asks about it

00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:26,110
or be able to ask people as they come in

00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:29,850
if they're interested you also if

00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:32,379
possible I know some are extremely large

00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:33,490
but if it's slightly smaller do

00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:35,529
introductions of the big

00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,990
getting like I'm talking literally like

00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:38,860
even if it's 30 people go for it because

00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:40,209
if you have everyone introduce

00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,870
themselves and mention what they're

00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:43,450
working on

00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:44,950
you can ask experienced people to raise

00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,480
their hands if they're willing to be

00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:49,089
available to help throughout the night

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,459
it can be time-consuming but it will

00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:53,339
help build community and create creative

00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:56,320
opportunities for people to collaborate

00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:57,790
so speaking of that reassure people that

00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,500
it's okay if they are not working on a

00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,910
project and you can have people raise

00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:05,410
their hands at the beginning if they're

00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:07,000
looking to collaborate so let's talk

00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:11,589
about teaching people how to code really

00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,540
quick this is the scary thing so some

00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:16,120
do's and don'ts of teaching programming

00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:18,190
because there is no one way one best way

00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:21,330
for teaching people how to code

00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:25,660
however I've had some success with

00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:27,580
certain methods more so than others I do

00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,230
have beginner focus events where people

00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,839
can bring questions from any tutorial

00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:34,990
lake shoes as I mentioned earlier this

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,880
is an essential part of pilots Boston I

00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,920
always suggest my two favorite tutorials

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,130
but if someone learns better another way

00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,870
say like MOOC or videos they can use

00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:46,750
those as well and I'll still answer

00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:48,550
questions I also try to make it clear in

00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,829
any communication that I'm always

00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:52,209
available by email that's also a high

00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:53,860
bar I don't especially if you're running

00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:55,329
a really really large user group I don't

00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,970
necessarily I recommend that but if

00:16:55,329 --> 00:17:02,500
you've got a smaller group not that many

00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:04,179
people are gonna email you so I like I

00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,370
was making myself available to you about

00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:09,699
1,500 people through the groups that I

00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:10,929
ran and even more through my website

00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:14,170
where I'm just like contact me I don't

00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:16,150
care I'll help you and I would get like

00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,949
an email at week max it wasn't that bad

00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,059
but the people who did ask for help

00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:24,100
really needed it and they really

00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:25,809
appreciated it so don't have a free

00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:28,600
class that builds on itself week after

00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:29,770
week because it sort of works if people

00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,559
are paying for it because then they're

00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:33,790
financially motivated but if you're just

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,550
trying to provide a free service to your

00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:39,100
community which is awesome but this is a

00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:42,040
bad option for you because I did this at

00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:44,530
first and I held classes it was just two

00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,090
hours every other weekend and great

00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,150
turnout the first week like thirty

00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,610
people I was like yeah

00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:51,890
is great second week 20 people still

00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:54,760
great and by the fifth week it was just

00:17:51,890 --> 00:18:00,860
me and my co organizer so like don't

00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:02,750
don't do that do give short one-off

00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:05,180
tutorials on basic programming concepts

00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,740
that don't build on each other so you

00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:09,110
can't necessarily do a ton of these

00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,630
since most of programming does require

00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:13,130
not knowing other concepts but you can't

00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,690
teach the idea of object-oriented

00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:17,360
programming without involving a

00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,740
significant amount of code or you there

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,800
are other languages that you can teach

00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:24,350
the basics of in a two-hour period with

00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,690
sequels my favorite but you could also

00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:29,660
potentially do HTML and the goal is to

00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:32,060
share knowledge so get creative don't

00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:34,640
give a text tutorial with absolutely no

00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:38,420
support so if I just tell someone here's

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:42,260
like learn Python the hard way have fun

00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:43,490
it's easy no problem with no support

00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:46,190
group or a place to reach out for help

00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:47,810
when people get into a tight spot they

00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:49,900
could assume that they just aren't cut

00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:52,160
out for programming and absolutely quit

00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:55,010
there's so stigma that you have to be

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,350
good at math to be a programmer and or

00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:58,910
like you know you have to be smart if

00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:01,610
you're not smart you definitely can't

00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:03,500
and people think oh I just I'm not smart

00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:06,260
so some non-technical people think that

00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,820
only geniuses can program and again I've

00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:10,400
been told that I must be super smart

00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:13,490
because I'm a developer fools all of

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,900
them because I'm not like often it's

00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:17,510
just a matter of seeing the right

00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,710
example for a concept to make sense so

00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,720
just because someone has trouble

00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,920
learning and using one resource doesn't

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,080
mean they couldn't learn using another

00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,940
but if it's your first introduction you

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,580
might think that you have no clue what's

00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,410
going on and you know you never will so

00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:34,730
really quick let's talk a little bit

00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:36,470
about how to be the best ally you need

00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,690
to respect if you were told you're not

00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:40,670
welcome in a space please respect that

00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:43,610
don't argue with the organizers or

00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:45,710
demand a reason and even if you can't

00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:49,130
attend events that doesn't mean you

00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:52,310
can't help as someone who regularly want

00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:54,380
runs events that are only for women in

00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:58,909
non-binary people it is not because I

00:19:54,380 --> 00:20:02,990
hate men I married one and

00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:05,909
but it's just it's a different space and

00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:07,740
hey anyway so take time to listen to

00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:10,230
your friends and empathize with what

00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:13,529
they tell you like about the issues that

00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:15,240
they may be having don't write off their

00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:18,690
feelings if you don't understand and

00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:21,870
this is a big one because we all have

00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:24,179
like a different intersection of

00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:27,649
privileges every every single one of us

00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:30,269
has like something over someone else and

00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:31,529
someone might be having trouble you

00:20:30,269 --> 00:20:35,820
can't be like oh well surely that's not

00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:37,919
actually an issue no like tell them that

00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,590
what they're feeling is valid and that

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:44,220
is seriously a big thing that a lot of

00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:46,289
people don't do ask how you can help and

00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,779
actually listen and follow through to

00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:51,960
the best of your ability because often

00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:56,639
times maybe let's say a woman's focus

00:20:51,960 --> 00:21:00,389
group might need volunteers for you know

00:20:56,639 --> 00:21:02,480
mock interviews or something and there's

00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:05,460
still there's still a chance to help and

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,590
the best thing you can do is to spread

00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,360
the word to people who may be interested

00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,950
in joining the community so if you run

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,870
an organization with a similar focus

00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:15,630
provide a way for the organizers to

00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:17,820
promote their group like I've gotten a

00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:19,980
lot of pushback before thinking that I

00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:23,549
was gonna be stealing all the women from

00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:26,460
like Boston Python and I wasn't at all

00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:29,549
like my goal was to get more women in

00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:31,789
their group by bringing more women of

00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:36,389
the community period I did not want to

00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:38,210
steal anyone but even like through

00:21:36,389 --> 00:21:41,570
mailing lists or making an announcement

00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:43,950
so you can make a difference

00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:46,320
these are my recommendations on how to

00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:48,960
build communities for beginners but

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,429
however you involve yourself being a

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,559
part of a space where everyone is

00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:54,210
welcome to learn is a valuable and

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,500
rewarding experience that can really

00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:59,820
make a difference to someone who's just

00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:03,350
starting out so this is all I do have

00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:06,600
like yes totally nailed the time here

00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:07,679
these are all like my contact things and

00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,919
I also want to give a shout out to

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,200
oculis he's action turkey girl on

00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:14,809
Twitter who originally

00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:18,200
Alysha portion of this talking 2014 and

00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:20,299
that's a link to it these are some

00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:24,260
resources which it's pretty long but if

00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:27,080
you looked at this slides on speaker

00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:29,539
deck you can see all of these and so I

00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:34,820
will take questions while everyone can

00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:38,630
watch this amazing gift hopefully it'll

00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:40,110
keep going forever well thank you

00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:47,049
Jennifer a great talk

00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:47,049
