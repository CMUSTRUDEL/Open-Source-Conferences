	DjangoCon US 2018 - Building a Community for All People by Jennifer Konikowski

Are you having trouble getting beginners to stick around in your user group? What’s the best way to help people who are just getting started with Django and Python? Are you finding it difficult to attract and keep a diverse audience? Since I started PyLadies Boston in 2013, I’ve learned a few lessons about the best way to help out beginners and cultivate a welcoming community for marginalized folks. In this talk, I will cover:

Starting a group with the intention to be beginner-friendly
Creating a welcoming environment
Beginner friendly meeting topics
Finding the best way to teach people to code
Being a good ally

This talk will benefit anyone who is currently running or thinking of starting a user group.

This talk was presented at: https://2018.djangocon.us/talk/building-a-community-for-all-people/

00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,390
so as this says this is really how to

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,519
make your group super accessible to

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,840
people learning to code and why it's

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,420
important to have user groups for

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,250
minority groups in tech all combined

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,140
into one 25 minutes if you want to

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,380
follow along the slides there @jm connie

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,000
comm slash building community so i'm

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,600
jennifer chronic Kowski j i'm connie in

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,670
most places at GenCon e on twitter and

00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,620
i'm a software engineer at six fix and

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,390
founder of pi ladies boston a python

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,890
user group for women and gender queer

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,660
individuals that has grown to over a

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,370
thousand members since moving to

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,530
Pittsburgh last April

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,039
I'm usually found a girl develop its

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,649
code and cotton coffee monthly meetups

00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,809
so when I would go to user groups as a

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,600
newer developer it was very intimidating

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:06,420
people seem to know each other and I

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,450
wasn't sure who to ask for help I also

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,479
was usually surrounded by all or mostly

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,010
men and I wanted a smaller group where I

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,040
could talk to other women who had

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,200
similar goals to myself which is why I

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,240
ended up starting pilotis Boston I mean

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,780
and to make friends with awesome Python

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:28,500
people so why would I create an

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,210
exclusive group so this is a quote

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,130
what's read out it turns out that

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,590
communities exist for a variety of

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,600
reasons some of which have nothing to do

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,640
with explaining themselves a cause a

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,259
technology or a gender to the rest of

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,720
the world and this is selena deckle men

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,880
who is one of the organizers of pilotis

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,950
portland she wrote this in response to

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,320
the question why are there so many women

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,020
in tech groups groups can celebrate our

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,630
similarities but also ways in which

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,180
we're different and sometimes that

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,860
similarity might be Python or Django and

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,159
sometimes it might be narrowed down even

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:05,219
further to women who program in Python

00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:08,599
so why narrow down to begin with because

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:11,940
often when you're the minority you feel

00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:13,380
less confident because you're different

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,020
which makes you less

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,490
likely to speak up part of this can be

00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,800
the feeling that you are representing

00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,720
your group when you speak and being

00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,730
overly concerned about saying something

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,610
that would be considered unintelligent

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,560
saij sharp address this in the context

00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,450
of applying for jobs in their talk

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,370
herding cats with Django yesterday and

00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,490
y'all should maybe go watch that as soon

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,860
as it's posted if you didn't see it so

00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:40,710
all so different life experiences are

00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,710
exasperated and when everyone's life

00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:45,030
experiences are a bit different

00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,950
sorry while everyone's life experiences

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,220
are a bit different when you're a

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,880
different gender sex race or orientation

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,840
the differences tend to be amplified in

00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,690
conversation it can sometimes feel like

00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,130
others aren't interested in your

00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,900
particular experiences or like you don't

00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,640
have anything in common and this often

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,400
has nothing to do with how others are

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,660
behaving it can often just be a feeling

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,940
and oftentimes other people will assume

00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,740
you're just there with a friend or don't

00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,140
have the same level of knowledge that

00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:19,800
they do this is especially true the more

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:22,170
visibly you stand out I'm in particular

00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,150
with women in men's spaces and

00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,550
particular very femme presenting women

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,800
this leads to people speaking to you in

00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:33,030
a condescending way even though this can

00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:35,010
often be completely unintentional so

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,870
that's what being different does it

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,330
makes you aware of your actions and that

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,700
you might be imposing it's so minor but

00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,860
it adds up this is by Ellen Kisa

00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,020
who at the time of writing this was a

00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,580
project product manager at Kickstarter

00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,190
and one of the very few women in her

00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,900
department in the Post quoted she talks

00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,790
about her co-workers mostly young dads

00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,620
inviting her out to lunch and working

00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:58,740
hard to include her but she still felt

00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:02,820
out of place right so why bother

00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:05,310
focusing on beginners so diverse teams

00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,840
are smarter straight up and we want to

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,670
ensure that our communities are open to

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,190
beginners because we need to expand and

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:13,290
diversify women and minorities are more

00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:15,330
likely to learn to program later in life

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:18,390
and the more diverse our community is

00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:20,520
the more diverse our teams will be so

00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,740
Harvard Business Review wrote this

00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,390
amazing post and one of their

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,950
conclusions was that working with people

00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,690
who are different from you

00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,700
challenge your brain to overcome its

00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,820
sale ways of thinking and sharpen its

00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:35,430
performance and who doesn't want a sharp

00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:38,310
brain everyone should be able to learn

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,840
to program programming shouldn't just be

00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,730
limited to people who are proven

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,580
privileged enough to learn to code in

00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:47,400
grade school or be able to select

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:50,520
computer science degree in college or go

00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,950
to college even so we need to be open to

00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,320
helping people learn no matter their age

00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,940
gender or background if someone wants to

00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,890
join our community we should be open

00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,260
helping them learn having community to

00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:03,060
help learn should not only be open to

00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,940
people willing to pay thousands of

00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:09,510
dollars for a code school or a boot camp

00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:11,460
all right so now hopefully you get the

00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:14,820
why and hopefully you're sold on why

00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:16,980
it's important so how can you do your

00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,200
best to make sure your group is open to

00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:22,560
beginners and how can you be an ally to

00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:25,440
marginalize people in your community so

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,940
first let's talk about user groups some

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,380
of these will be easily easier to

00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,540
implement if you're starting a new group

00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,610
but considering making but consider

00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,430
making changes if you're a part of the

00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:38,010
leadership team for an existing group

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,960
also secret if you aren't on the

00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:42,000
leadership team and see one of these

00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,130
ideas that you think would benefit your

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,650
local group reach out to the leadership

00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:50,720
team and volunteer because most groups

00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:52,860
would love more volunteers alright so

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,050
one of the first things you can do is

00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,860
make sure you describe your group and

00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:00,720
events as beginner inclusive ideally if

00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,090
they are beginner inclusive if you're

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,050
only having really high level talks make

00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:08,850
it extremely clear but here's an example

00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:12,870
no problem too big or small good for

00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:15,000
people of all levels and just be very

00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,160
clear about your descriptions be clear

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,560
what about what knowledge and skills are

00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,480
required so people will often

00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,320
underestimate themselves so keep this in

00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:27,690
mind when describing what's needed so

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,850
example basic Python required should

00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:33,630
have mostly completed a tutorial like

00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:37,830
learn Python the hard way find out what

00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:39,389
your local community actually needs you

00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:43,379
know what kind of

00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:46,169
companies are around you do you have a

00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:49,860
lot of academics maybe you want to have

00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:51,539
some CyHi tutorials you know this is

00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:55,289
very important because every community

00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:57,389
needs different things in Boston we had

00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:59,729
a large community and I go to academics

00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:02,490
and scientist so there was a huge desire

00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:05,580
for tutorials and code reviews but with

00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:09,689
Boston Ruby women so I'm actually a

00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:12,330
rails developer we have a lot of we had

00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:13,259
a lot of recent bootcamp grads and so we

00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:17,159
spent more time talking about

00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:20,759
interviewing and finding jobs you want

00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:22,919
to ask for feedback constantly like

00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:26,219
don't want to annoy your members but at

00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:27,840
least once a year so like when I was

00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:29,669
running pilings Boston every year I had

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,710
an anniversary party and asked everyone

00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:33,900
who attended for feedback on the past

00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:35,819
year you know what did they like what

00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:39,319
did they not like and four suggestions

00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:42,150
in the future and the regular evaluation

00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:43,500
really helped us have new types of

00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,900
events that I wouldn't have thought of

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,080
on my own and got rid of ones that I

00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:52,440
thought were great ideas that just

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,750
totally bombed so and you also want to

00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,250
try a lot of different types so

00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,779
depending on your local community some

00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,550
may work better for you than others and

00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:01,589
here are some event types that I've had

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:05,460
success with most obvious is

00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:06,900
presentation nights but often there's an

00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,449
idea that you have to be an expert to

00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,430
give a presentation so make it clear

00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:12,539
when asking for presentations that

00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:15,719
you're open to presentations about

00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:17,909
beginner projects as well

00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:19,860
enlightening talks are a great way to

00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:21,870
get people to do their first public talk

00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,990
and one of the ways that I've encouraged

00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:28,349
people is to say that while it should

00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,490
maybe be related related if you have

00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:31,050
hobby that you want to share with

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:33,060
everyone we'd love to hear a lightning

00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,740
talk on it so one of the members of Pi

00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,079
ladies ended up doing her very first

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,969
presentation ever on bird-watching and

00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:43,560
it was a huge hit and her next talk was

00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:45,149
technical so tutorials were very

00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,920
successful for us and this is one of the

00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:49,350
things that's often harder for much

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:53,280
larger user groups but I sort of want to

00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:55,860
push you to consider it

00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,480
because they give an experience they

00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,670
have experience people a chance to share

00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,100
their knowledge in a meaningful way and

00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:05,490
more inexperienced people a chance to

00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,440
learn a new skill or toolset

00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,750
however with tutorials it's key to allow

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,000
for extra time in the beginning or

00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,190
before the event to get set up even if

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,150
you have really clear instructions and

00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:20,430
ask people to set up prior they'll still

00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:23,700
need extra time because people won't do

00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,650
it so one of the things we started doing

00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,020
that was really fun and in a way I

00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:30,510
wasn't expecting was mob programming and

00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,680
so the whole group looks at the same

00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,890
problem and tries to solve it together

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,570
occasionally this is done in offices but

00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:39,630
I actually found that it's fun to do as

00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:41,070
a group so we started running events

00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,830
that were a combination of mob

00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:46,140
programming and code reviews so everyone

00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:48,600
can participate so even with limited

00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,250
programming knowledge you can get an

00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,160
idea of what kinds of problems other

00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,930
people are facing and great and often

00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,030
time if you're the organizer you might

00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,589
end up having to put some of your code

00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,600
up because people will be too nervous

00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:01,080
but then after you get your code torn to

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,780
shreds

00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:08,970
so one also be like oh well that's not

00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:10,890
that bad you know okay so you also want

00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:13,200
to consider hosting separate beginner

00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:15,270
focused events so these events will draw

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,440
out people who are still too intimidated

00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:21,780
to go to the main meetings so we even

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,339
for just PI ladies we had women show up

00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,320
to beginner events that would never go

00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:28,530
to the main group even though the main

00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,210
group was still focused on beginners but

00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:32,370
they were still working through the

00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:36,030
tutorial and weren't sure that they

00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:41,339
would feel that they were ready to go to

00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:43,140
the larger group so you can host events

00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:45,900
like study groups which can help people

00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:47,310
teach each other so we tried to have

00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,080
study groups every week and have a

00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:51,570
mentor each time which is a little

00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,430
aggressive and definitely very hard to

00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:55,680
do so I don't want to say you have to do

00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:57,270
that but we've also encouraged our

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,060
members to start study groups in their

00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:03,209
neighborhoods as well and have had a ton

00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:05,160
of success with that I've used these to

00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:06,310
target people who are just starting to

00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,069
learn to code

00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:12,490
and if you're trying to provide mentors

00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:14,199
at study groups it can be a challenge

00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:16,120
but one way to sell it to your more

00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:17,170
experienced members is that it's a way

00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,519
to both share their knowledge and

00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,860
improve their understanding of the

00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:22,809
fundamentals I have one woman who comes

00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:25,899
every week and she always challenges me

00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:27,579
and makes me go deeper into the language

00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:29,649
than I had before and definitely one of

00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:34,209
the things I really miss about living in

00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:36,399
Boston and we also had mentorships

00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:39,009
mentor sessions which were similar to

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,589
study groups but more focused on career

00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:44,230
growth so they were targeting people who

00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:46,600
knew how to code but we're looking to

00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:50,499
enter the industry and job hunting as a

00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:52,120
junior is extremely discouraging and so

00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:54,220
it really helped to have regular

00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,829
meetings with someone who tells you that

00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,360
you can do it and also by getting to

00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:01,149
know a larger amount of junior

00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,680
developers it makes it easier for you to

00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:05,050
find great developers who just haven't

00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,519
been given a chance yet so frequently

00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,230
it's harder to get to know people in the

00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:10,629
larger group setting and having a

00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:12,790
smaller subset like a mentor session can

00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:14,350
help you're more experienced members get

00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,990
to know the individuals who are just

00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:19,360
getting started

00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:21,639
so when really this is the thing that

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,129
every group should do and it's really

00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:26,500
easy if you're using Meetup

00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:28,809
send an email to everyone who joins with

00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,269
a message that emphasizes that everyone

00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:32,889
is welcome no matter what their level of

00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:35,129
experience is and let them know what

00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:38,800
they can expect to happen at your event

00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:40,569
so with meetup you write it once and

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:45,339
just have it send automatically it's

00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:49,120
fantastic if you can have someone to

00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:51,189
greet people when they walk in ideally

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,379
it's one of the organizers or someone

00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:55,179
who's there regularly and this

00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:57,370
individual should do their best to get

00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:59,259
to know people who have just joined it

00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:01,360
will give all newcomers a friendly face

00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:03,819
each time they return and someone who is

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,370
familiar with their level so with hi

00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:08,589
ladies this was basically me because

00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,029
even when we got larger it was never too

00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:16,750
large so and I was there every single

00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:18,699
month so but people saw me and we're

00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,779
familiar and felt a little bit I could

00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:22,180
tell like the

00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:23,860
in month they came they felt much much

00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:28,959
more secure because they're like oh I

00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:32,230
know someone this is fine um consider

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,629
like if you're a larger group having an

00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:39,040
event that's just for a marginalized

00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:41,050
group so it does require you to have a

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,529
member of that marginalized group who's

00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:47,620
interested in hosting it so one way to

00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:49,809
do this is to host an event like and all

00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,819
the nerdy ladies my friend Pamela

00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:54,339
Vickers started doing all the nerdy

00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:55,930
ladies in Atlanta as a way to get people

00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:58,870
from all these different like women and

00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:02,139
tech groups together and you could

00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:04,629
easily talk to maybe some other user

00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:06,610
groups and be like hey like you know let

00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:08,620
let's work together you know get the

00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,910
women from our group together and it can

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,309
help encourage women to attend the

00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:14,439
larger meetups as well and get feedback

00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:16,709
as to why they weren't coming to the

00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:20,649
main meetups in the first place

00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:22,420
so for presentation nights you want to

00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:24,699
ensure that there are regular talks that

00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:27,699
are suitable for beginners doesn't have

00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:30,089
to be like every single time but usually

00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:33,250
maybe you have like two to three

00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:35,920
presentations have one of those be a

00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,449
little bit more entry level and they

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,970
don't have to be you know how to write a

00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:42,309
for loop but more here's a problem this

00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:44,290
is how I salt it and with less of an

00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:47,949
emphasis on like deep dives into the

00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:50,529
language organizers I spoke to said they

00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:52,300
got large influxes of new signups for

00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:56,860
nights when they had multiple speakers

00:14:52,300 --> 00:15:00,970
from a variety of fields and so a few

00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:03,040
suggestions for project nights have a

00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:06,100
couple of beginner tables that are

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,709
clearly marked and preferably have a few

00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,100
experienced programmers to staff them

00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:15,250
and help new people work through issues

00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:17,290
so as soon as someone comes in you know

00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,569
the greeter should be able to point out

00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:21,670
that table if the person asks about it

00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:26,110
or be able to ask people as they come in

00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:29,850
if they're interested you also if

00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:32,379
possible I know some are extremely large

00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:33,490
but if it's slightly smaller do

00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:35,529
introductions of the big

00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,990
getting like I'm talking literally like

00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:38,860
even if it's 30 people go for it because

00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:40,209
if you have everyone introduce

00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,870
themselves and mention what they're

00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:43,450
working on

00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:44,950
you can ask experienced people to raise

00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,480
their hands if they're willing to be

00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:49,089
available to help throughout the night

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,459
it can be time-consuming but it will

00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:53,339
help build community and create creative

00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:56,320
opportunities for people to collaborate

00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:57,790
so speaking of that reassure people that

00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,500
it's okay if they are not working on a

00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,910
project and you can have people raise

00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:05,410
their hands at the beginning if they're

00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:07,000
looking to collaborate so let's talk

00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:11,589
about teaching people how to code really

00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,540
quick this is the scary thing so some

00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:16,120
do's and don'ts of teaching programming

00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:18,190
because there is no one way one best way

00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:21,330
for teaching people how to code

00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:25,660
however I've had some success with

00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:27,580
certain methods more so than others I do

00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,230
have beginner focus events where people

00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,839
can bring questions from any tutorial

00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:34,990
lake shoes as I mentioned earlier this

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,880
is an essential part of pilots Boston I

00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,920
always suggest my two favorite tutorials

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,130
but if someone learns better another way

00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,870
say like MOOC or videos they can use

00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:46,750
those as well and I'll still answer

00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:48,550
questions I also try to make it clear in

00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,829
any communication that I'm always

00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:52,209
available by email that's also a high

00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:53,860
bar I don't especially if you're running

00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:55,329
a really really large user group I don't

00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,970
necessarily I recommend that but if

00:16:55,329 --> 00:17:02,500
you've got a smaller group not that many

00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:04,179
people are gonna email you so I like I

00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,370
was making myself available to you about

00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:09,699
1,500 people through the groups that I

00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:10,929
ran and even more through my website

00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:14,170
where I'm just like contact me I don't

00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:16,150
care I'll help you and I would get like

00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,949
an email at week max it wasn't that bad

00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,059
but the people who did ask for help

00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:24,100
really needed it and they really

00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:25,809
appreciated it so don't have a free

00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:28,600
class that builds on itself week after

00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:29,770
week because it sort of works if people

00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,559
are paying for it because then they're

00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:33,790
financially motivated but if you're just

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,550
trying to provide a free service to your

00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:39,100
community which is awesome but this is a

00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:42,040
bad option for you because I did this at

00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:44,530
first and I held classes it was just two

00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,090
hours every other weekend and great

00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,150
turnout the first week like thirty

00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,610
people I was like yeah

00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:51,890
is great second week 20 people still

00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:54,760
great and by the fifth week it was just

00:17:51,890 --> 00:18:00,860
me and my co organizer so like don't

00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:02,750
don't do that do give short one-off

00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:05,180
tutorials on basic programming concepts

00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,740
that don't build on each other so you

00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:09,110
can't necessarily do a ton of these

00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,630
since most of programming does require

00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:13,130
not knowing other concepts but you can't

00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,690
teach the idea of object-oriented

00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:17,360
programming without involving a

00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,740
significant amount of code or you there

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,800
are other languages that you can teach

00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:24,350
the basics of in a two-hour period with

00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,690
sequels my favorite but you could also

00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:29,660
potentially do HTML and the goal is to

00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:32,060
share knowledge so get creative don't

00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:34,640
give a text tutorial with absolutely no

00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:38,420
support so if I just tell someone here's

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:42,260
like learn Python the hard way have fun

00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:43,490
it's easy no problem with no support

00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:46,190
group or a place to reach out for help

00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:47,810
when people get into a tight spot they

00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:49,900
could assume that they just aren't cut

00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:52,160
out for programming and absolutely quit

00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:55,010
there's so stigma that you have to be

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,350
good at math to be a programmer and or

00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:58,910
like you know you have to be smart if

00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:01,610
you're not smart you definitely can't

00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:03,500
and people think oh I just I'm not smart

00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:06,260
so some non-technical people think that

00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,820
only geniuses can program and again I've

00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:10,400
been told that I must be super smart

00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:13,490
because I'm a developer fools all of

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,900
them because I'm not like often it's

00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:17,510
just a matter of seeing the right

00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,710
example for a concept to make sense so

00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,720
just because someone has trouble

00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,920
learning and using one resource doesn't

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,080
mean they couldn't learn using another

00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,940
but if it's your first introduction you

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,580
might think that you have no clue what's

00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,410
going on and you know you never will so

00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:34,730
really quick let's talk a little bit

00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:36,470
about how to be the best ally you need

00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,690
to respect if you were told you're not

00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:40,670
welcome in a space please respect that

00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:43,610
don't argue with the organizers or

00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:45,710
demand a reason and even if you can't

00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:49,130
attend events that doesn't mean you

00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:52,310
can't help as someone who regularly want

00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:54,380
runs events that are only for women in

00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:58,909
non-binary people it is not because I

00:19:54,380 --> 00:20:02,990
hate men I married one and

00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:05,909
but it's just it's a different space and

00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:07,740
hey anyway so take time to listen to

00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:10,230
your friends and empathize with what

00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:13,529
they tell you like about the issues that

00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:15,240
they may be having don't write off their

00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:18,690
feelings if you don't understand and

00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:21,870
this is a big one because we all have

00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:24,179
like a different intersection of

00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:27,649
privileges every every single one of us

00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:30,269
has like something over someone else and

00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:31,529
someone might be having trouble you

00:20:30,269 --> 00:20:35,820
can't be like oh well surely that's not

00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:37,919
actually an issue no like tell them that

00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,590
what they're feeling is valid and that

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:44,220
is seriously a big thing that a lot of

00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:46,289
people don't do ask how you can help and

00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,779
actually listen and follow through to

00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:51,960
the best of your ability because often

00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:56,639
times maybe let's say a woman's focus

00:20:51,960 --> 00:21:00,389
group might need volunteers for you know

00:20:56,639 --> 00:21:02,480
mock interviews or something and there's

00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:05,460
still there's still a chance to help and

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,590
the best thing you can do is to spread

00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,360
the word to people who may be interested

00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,950
in joining the community so if you run

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,870
an organization with a similar focus

00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:15,630
provide a way for the organizers to

00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:17,820
promote their group like I've gotten a

00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:19,980
lot of pushback before thinking that I

00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:23,549
was gonna be stealing all the women from

00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:26,460
like Boston Python and I wasn't at all

00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:29,549
like my goal was to get more women in

00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:31,789
their group by bringing more women of

00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:36,389
the community period I did not want to

00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:38,210
steal anyone but even like through

00:21:36,389 --> 00:21:41,570
mailing lists or making an announcement

00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:43,950
so you can make a difference

00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:46,320
these are my recommendations on how to

00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:48,960
build communities for beginners but

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,429
however you involve yourself being a

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,559
part of a space where everyone is

00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:54,210
welcome to learn is a valuable and

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,500
rewarding experience that can really

00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:59,820
make a difference to someone who's just

00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:03,350
starting out so this is all I do have

00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:06,600
like yes totally nailed the time here

00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:07,679
these are all like my contact things and

00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,919
I also want to give a shout out to

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,200
oculis he's action turkey girl on

00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:14,809
Twitter who originally

00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:18,200
Alysha portion of this talking 2014 and

00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:20,299
that's a link to it these are some

00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:24,260
resources which it's pretty long but if

00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:27,080
you looked at this slides on speaker

00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:29,539
deck you can see all of these and so I

00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:34,820
will take questions while everyone can

00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:38,630
watch this amazing gift hopefully it'll

00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:40,110
keep going forever well thank you

00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:47,049
Jennifer a great talk

00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:47,049
