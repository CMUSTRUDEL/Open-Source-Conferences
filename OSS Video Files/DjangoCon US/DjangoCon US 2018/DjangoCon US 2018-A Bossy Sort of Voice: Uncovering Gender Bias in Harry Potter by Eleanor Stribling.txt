Description: 
	DjangoCon US 2018 - A Bossy Sort of Voice: Uncovering gender bias in Harry Potter with Python by Eleanor Stribling

The Harry Potter series is an incredibly popular franchise that shaped a generation, but it’s also been critiqued in the media and academics for its sometimes sexist portrayal of female characters. This talk uses Natural Language Processing techniques and Python to do the first quantitative analysis of gender bias in the language used to describe women and girls in the series, with a focus on Hermione Granger, the unsung hero of the story. Attendees will see techniques for reading and parsing large text files, leveraging grammatical rules to isolate the right words for the analysis, and data visualization techniques, using Python, the Natural Language Processing Toolkit (NLTK), and Matplotlib. After the talk, the audience will be able to get started on using the “magic” of programming to isolate biased language in any piece of text.

[Music]

00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:19,770
hi everyone thanks for coming to this

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,170
talk I know five o'clock is late and

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,820
it's been a long day I want to preface

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,470
everything by saying I am NOT going to

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,710
show you a bunch of code I'm going to

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,330
talk more about how I transform data so

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,090
I'm gonna do it without showing you any

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,370
code if you want code though you can go

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,110
to that URL and there you'll find a

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,700
github repo with Jupiter notebook that

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,079
walks through all of this stuff so if

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,010
you really want to see some code at 5:00

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,340
p.m. on a Monday feel free so this talk

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,920
is sort of near and dear to my heart

00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:52,079
because it rose out of something that

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,030
was happening in both my my personal and

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,550
professional life so my professional

00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,309
life is I'm right now a group product

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:02,039
manager at Zendesk in San Francisco I've

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,559
been in tech in the Bay Area for about

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,119
10 years most of that as a product

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:10,200
manager but pretty much the whole time

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,729
I've been in a leadership role at tech

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,100
companies varied from teeny tiny

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,890
startups to really big tech companies

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,840
that you've definitely heard of and the

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,939
common thread though throughout my

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,650
entire experience was what a lot of

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,830
women experience which is just kind of

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,720
little tiny bits of disrespect all the

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:31,170
time and they were usually in the form

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,729
of very subtle very coded language and

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,470
this has always bothered me I love my

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,840
work I love what I do that's why I still

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,979
do it but it's hard to take and it does

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,720
wear on you so while that was happening

00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:46,380
some significant things happen in my

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,670
personal life among them I had some kids

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:54,630
and one year my son who is extremely

00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:56,430
into books and reading got Harry Potter

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,619
and the Philosopher's Stone stone is a

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,570
Christmas gift and this came from my

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,689
sister-in-law who loves Harry Potter has

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,979
read every one about ten times and

00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:06,390
insisted that this was great for him I

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,099
didn't really know much about it I sort

00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,520
of missed it being part of the Star Wars

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,840
generation and so I was didn't really

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,980
know much about it honestly

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,800
I'd seen the movies I think I fell

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,660
asleep in number five at one point so

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,069
yeah a very vague understanding of what

00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,739
Harry Potter was but you know I thought

00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:24,269
I'd give it a try she would know and for

00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:26,040
those of you who aren't familiar it's a

00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,420
series of books and it's really a

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,069
franchise now have a lot of other things

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,930
but originally was a series of seven

00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:33,450
books and it's about this kid named

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:36,810
Harry Potter and it follows him through

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,610
ages 11 to 17 as he attends this

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,349
boarding school in Britain called

00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:43,319
Hogwarts where he learns how to be a

00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:44,819
wizard and he meets up with other young

00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,310
people going through that same process

00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:48,720
so like going through puberty and

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,230
learning how to do magic which is a

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,370
horrible combination of things but I

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,160
could not have been trust with that but

00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,950
at the same time that this is happening

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,959
Lord Voldemort who is like a super super

00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,739
evil guy who wants to take over the

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,840
world

00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,790
reappears after everyone totally thought

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,290
he was dead and thought that Harry was

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,079
the only person who ever faced him and

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,030
survived so that's the premise of the

00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:13,860
books so it sounds a little bit scary

00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,030
for a four-year-old but I was like okay

00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,739
you know I guess we couldn't give this a

00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,510
shot so we started with philosopher's

00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:21,329
stone and one of the things I noticed

00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,950
about this book which was really

00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:24,269
interesting was even though everyone

00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,519
told me about how much I would love

00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:28,139
Hermione who's one of Harry's friends

00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,120
he's got two friends Ron and Hermione

00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:32,040
and they're all the books they help him

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,870
out with stuff all the time even though

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,569
Harry is the center they're really

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,430
important characters and one thing I

00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:40,170
found very striking about it was I

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,480
really felt like the books could have

00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,799
been about Hermione because she's the

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,660
one who's got everything under control

00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,120
she works really hard at school she

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,269
studies she applies herself she's really

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,130
like she's conscientious she cares about

00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:55,470
other living things to a really large

00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,329
degree and I found this this graphic

00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,790
which I thought really encapsulated how

00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:02,310
I felt what if these books were actually

00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:04,200
about Hermione

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,910
my favorite is Hermione makes two

00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,829
useless friends that was my favorite one

00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,209
these are great by the way if you get a

00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:11,310
chance to read them all the slides are

00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,290
online but one thing that was really

00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,239
unfortunate to me and this is where my

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:17,880
personal and professional sort of

00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,969
situations sort of collided wasn't how

00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,070
Hermione was described so the title of

00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:25,260
this talk is a bossy sort of voice and

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,080
that's taken from the very first time

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,789
Hermione

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,199
introduced by JK rowling who's the

00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:32,710
writer of the Harry Potter series

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,919
she had a bossy sort of voice before

00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:38,259
she's even 8 and to me that really kind

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,210
of cut because growing up in the

00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:41,979
eighties and nineties being called bossy

00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,500
was not a good thing and it was almost

00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:48,610
always applied to girls and frequently

00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:50,409
to me so that kind of hurt and as I read

00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,090
it more these are just two examples I

00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:54,099
could sort of think of off the top of my

00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,960
head I kept seeing these things like

00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:58,240
bossy know-it-all shrill voice to

00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,560
describe women and girls so that was

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,090
kind of a letdown because I really

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,129
wanted to read this to my son

00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,840
to get him thinking about strong female

00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:08,020
characters and characters who didn't

00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,419
look like him generally so I decided to

00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,449
investigate this and try to turn it into

00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:14,530
a conference talk I'd like to say that

00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:16,930
even though I was part of the Star Wars

00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:19,479
generation I was not unaware of how

00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,250
popular the Sirius was so when I would

00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:22,930
tell people as I did this project under

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,810
your conference to talk about sexism in

00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:28,780
Harry Potter the reaction was pretty

00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:32,860
much this every single time like how

00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:35,020
dare you so that was a little bit

00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:38,380
disconcerting to anger the Harry Potter

00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:41,650
fan group but this wasn't just me other

00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:43,539
people have noticed this too and being

00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,979
you know kind of maybe a little bit like

00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:48,330
Hermione I did some research at the

00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:53,349
library and I found a bunch of books

00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:56,039
that whoops that cover this in some

00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:58,690
detail whoops

00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:01,690
little slide malfunction there they

00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:03,340
covered this in some detail and these

00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,219
chapters of these books are written by

00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,800
literary scholars and they write about a

00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:10,770
lot of really interesting things

00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:14,409
including gender bias and Harry Potter

00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:15,759
including race and Harry Potter magic

00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:17,110
culture and Harry Potter so a really

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,599
cool topic so if you're interested I

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:21,639
recommend to check it out but one thing

00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:23,080
I noticed is they approach it all always

00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:25,180
very much like literary scholars do

00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:28,120
which is talking about specific

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:30,699
situations talking about how those

00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,500
situations are woven into a bigger

00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:34,270
fabric and that makes a ton of sense but

00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,909
one thing that I didn't really see much

00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:39,249
of was really analyzing the language

00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:41,199
that Rowling used to describe the female

00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:42,759
characters it happened but it wasn't

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,279
done in kind of a broad programmatic way

00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:48,489
and this kind of makes sense there were

00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:50,889
seven books at the time and altogether

00:06:48,489 --> 00:06:52,659
they have one about 1.1 million words

00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:54,999
like actually more than that so this is

00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:56,709
not something you know your average you

00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:58,329
know literature professor is going to do

00:06:56,709 --> 00:07:00,549
so I thought this was a great

00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:02,649
opportunity to apply some code to the

00:07:00,549 --> 00:07:03,909
problem another way personal

00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:06,579
professional kind of collided on this

00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:09,369
one so I want to talk next about what I

00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:11,079
actually did how I how I went about this

00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:12,339
because I think this is actually more so

00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:15,189
than the code really the most

00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:17,679
interesting part of the project so the

00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:20,289
toolbox I used pretty straightforward

00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:22,389
Python Jupiter notebook which you'll see

00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:24,129
in the github repo I use the natural

00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:25,809
language processing toolkit and I didn't

00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:27,699
even use the most powerful parts of it I

00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:29,589
used some pretty sort of standard

00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:32,110
functions in it that were incredibly

00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:33,729
useful though and I use PI plot because

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:36,099
what is the textual analysis without a

00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:39,309
lot of word clouds so brace yourself for

00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:41,079
some more clouds coming right up so

00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:42,459
figuring out how to approach this was

00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:43,689
hard because if you've read the Harry

00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:46,299
Potter books there are seven of them

00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:49,779
they span like seven years and there are

00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:50,889
a lot of characters so I was kind of you

00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:52,839
know what I do I went through this whole

00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:54,610
process trying to figure out how do I

00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:56,559
find all the female characters I'm as

00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:59,289
long as wikis trying to like pull date

00:07:56,559 --> 00:08:02,559
off it was sort of a mess but I decided

00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:05,049
to simplify a little bit and to look at

00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:07,989
as my hypothesis that Hermione was going

00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:10,179
to be described by JK Rowling in words

00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:13,149
that are used to describe women in a

00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:15,399
pejorative way or highlight really sort

00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:18,519
of effeminate qualities and not so great

00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:20,259
way so that that was why I decided to do

00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:22,269
and I decided to compare her to Harry

00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:24,759
and Ron and the main reason I did this

00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:26,589
was that she's mentioned quite a bit as

00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:28,089
are Harry and Ron and so even though

00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:31,479
she's mentioned the least of the three

00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:33,279
not surprisingly right she is mentioned

00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:34,419
in every single book and she matures

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,709
with him and they're all about the same

00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:38,349
age so I thought you know it's pretty

00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:40,659
pretty good comparison what did this

00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:42,399
mean for my analysis well first of all

00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:44,620
it meant I wanted to focus on narration

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,389
not dialogue so I didn't really care if

00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,459
there was a sexist character what I

00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:49,600
cared about was how the narrator who's

00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:52,990
supposed to be a little bit objective

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,450
how the narrator was was

00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:58,470
describing her mining then I wanted to

00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:00,339
look at actions rather than the

00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,020
descriptions because there aren't really

00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:04,180
that many descriptions first of all and

00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:07,570
it's really hard to parse some of them

00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:09,790
and attribute the correct adjectives to

00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,500
the right character so I decided that I

00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,940
would concentrate only in verts in

00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,160
adverts I'll talk more about this a

00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,300
little bit later and then I decided I

00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,040
only wanted to compare the three

00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:21,940
principal characters like I mentioned

00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,380
only or Hermione versus Harry and Ron so

00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,480
there are three steps I use to analyze

00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,770
the text and once again you can go look

00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,560
at the code if you really really really

00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:30,820
want to look at code right now first I

00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,370
had to get the text into a format that

00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,930
Python could use then I had to isolate

00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:37,209
the parts of the text I wanted to

00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:39,450
analyze and then I wanted to find and

00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:41,980
summarize the relevant words within them

00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,870
so to illustrate that instead of using

00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,610
code I'm going to use an actual text

00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,230
snippet so this is if you're not

00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,510
familiar with the Harry Potter books and

00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:52,209
even read them multiple times which I

00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:54,100
know maybe some of you have this is from

00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:56,680
the Philosopher's Stone and this is

00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,390
shortly after that first introduction of

00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,589
Hermione I mentioned when all three of

00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,100
the principal characters are on the

00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:02,380
train

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,089
and the reason I used this one was that

00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,440
it's got both dialogue in duration and

00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:06,130
it mentions all three of the characters

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,420
so I think it's a pretty good

00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:12,700
illustration of what I did so here's the

00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,050
text this these first steps are really

00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:17,410
straightforward I just read it into

00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:19,810
Python using the open function it's a

00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:21,579
giant string now and then what I did was

00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:23,500
I used the word tokenize function and

00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:25,810
ltk which basically just takes that

00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,990
giant string of text that python has now

00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:30,910
able to grok takes that string of text

00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:35,079
and breaks it up into essentially a

00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:37,029
giant list of words and punctuation and

00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:38,800
it looks like that now if you've done

00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:40,810
text processing yourself you might

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,370
wonder well hang on don't you want to

00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:45,100
take a look punctuation the stop words

00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:47,380
out publication would be things like the

00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,510
quotation marks the commas etc and the

00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,959
stop words are common english-language

00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:55,060
words and the answer is no because the

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,920
punctuation and the order of the words

00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,880
and the proximity of the words was

00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,589
actually really important for my

00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,230
analysis so I'll show you why in a

00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:03,339
second but that's why I didn't do that

00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:04,870
first order of business was remember I

00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:06,490
want narration I want to see how this

00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,819
objected narrator describes Hermione

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,149
anyway

00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:11,319
that are different from Harry and Ron so

00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:13,299
one thing I learned whatever I do text

00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:15,129
processing is English is a really really

00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:16,449
inconsistent language but one thing that

00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:18,399
is consistent about it

00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:21,549
and is consistent in JK Rowling's novels

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,289
is when characters speak their dialogue

00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:25,959
is in quotation marks so I wrote a

00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:27,910
function to pull everything between

00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:30,729
quotation marks and stick it into this

00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:32,859
list of dialogue so then I just have the

00:11:30,729 --> 00:11:35,139
the dialogue from that snippet and then

00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:36,579
another list of narrations so every

00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:39,160
single narrative passage gets its own

00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:42,459
little sub list so that was the first

00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,799
step and remember I want to focus on the

00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:47,350
narration so from here on in discarding

00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:50,109
dialogue looking only at narration the

00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:51,970
next thing I did was look for mentions

00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:54,039
of Harry Ron and Hermione in the

00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,479
narration and I made a dictionary where

00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:57,339
the key is the character name and the

00:11:55,479 --> 00:11:58,989
value was a list of all the times they

00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:00,579
were mentioned now one thing you might

00:11:58,989 --> 00:12:02,619
be wondering is well what did you do if

00:12:00,579 --> 00:12:04,119
it had something like she said angrily

00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:07,089
how did you handle that

00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:08,889
I didn't just because it was harder to

00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:11,529
tell who that she might have been

00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:13,059
referring to so what I decided to do was

00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:14,679
just get rid of that and only use the

00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:16,569
instances where I was really really sure

00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:19,649
that those words applied to that

00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:21,850
protagonist so just be extra extra sure

00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:24,699
so those are the keys with the character

00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:27,959
names so then what I did was I used the

00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:30,249
position tag function and NL TK to

00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:32,139
identify the part of speech that each

00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:34,479
word represented so you can see that

00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:37,689
here so you've got if you look at the

00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:40,779
Harry key you can see Harry and then N n

00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:43,239
P so n N P is is a tag to represent the

00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:46,509
part of speech and n P is noun and then

00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:48,699
you've got looked which is a verb so and

00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:51,549
so on so this basically let me isolate

00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:53,139
the important nouns and the verbs and

00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:55,809
adverbs around them which again is what

00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:57,249
I wanted to look at so this is a little

00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:58,689
bit of a sidebar but this was a really

00:12:57,249 --> 00:13:01,269
important part of the project and I

00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:02,919
think another reason why why the process

00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:05,559
was kind of more interesting than they

00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:07,359
than the code in a lot of ways so I had

00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:09,669
to look at patterns in language in order

00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:11,409
to find the right words right so there

00:13:09,669 --> 00:13:14,470
are a few patterns that JK Rowling and

00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:16,959
most novelists use in putting verbs and

00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:19,630
adverbs around character names so one of

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:24,009
them is verb noun yelled

00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:27,069
right another one is verb now an adverb

00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:32,470
so said Harry happily another one is

00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:35,050
noun verb Harry saw another one is noun

00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:37,720
ahead for verb this is actually harder

00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:39,519
than its might sound and like Harry

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,860
whispered softly so those were the

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,449
patterns that I found and that make

00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,269
sense they're very common patterns in

00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:48,160
English so how I translated that into

00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:49,569
code and what I did with it well what I

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,199
did was I wrote a function that

00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:54,910
basically looked around looked for these

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,069
sequences here these are all noun verb

00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:59,170
or verb noun but just it's a simple

00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:02,470
example but to give you to give you some

00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:04,180
context for it so so basically I looked

00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:07,420
for those patterns that you can see

00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:09,040
there and then I made a dictionary where

00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,199
the key is the character name and the

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,199
values for all of those words that I

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,949
found that were verbs are adverbs so in

00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:19,750
this particular example you can see that

00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:21,819
said is used by both Harry and Hermione

00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,920
so that would mean in the next step

00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:26,860
where I basically got rid of all of

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,389
those repeated words the that said would

00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,970
be removed from both Hermione and

00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:32,920
Harry's list so what you learned from

00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,630
this dictionary is only Harry used the

00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,399
words look only looked was used to

00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:38,110
describe Harry muttered was only use

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,970
describer on sounds about right if you

00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,920
know the books and there is no unique

00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,939
verb or adverb therefore Hermione so

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:50,500
that's the process that I went through

00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:53,380
in a nutshell so now the findings so get

00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,430
ready for some more clouds so what one

00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,620
of the first things I did was look at

00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:59,079
how Hermione is described in in each

00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:02,949
book with words that are only used to

00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:05,649
describe her so this line has all the

00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:07,509
books on it and then when you look at

00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:09,430
all the word clouds it gives you a very

00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:11,439
high-level idea of what's going on here

00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:13,360
so some of the words are totally

00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:15,430
innocuous like earnestly or something

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,139
like that but you can see it's a book

00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:18,670
one you've got shriek squeaked and

00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:21,730
timidly or like the first things you see

00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:23,800
like right there on the on the left and

00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:25,209
it really depends on the book but

00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,610
they're definitely words in each one

00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:30,399
that are a little bit there's a lot of

00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:31,990
squealing just so you know and I spent a

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,020
lot of time around little boys growing

00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:35,360
up

00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:37,730
I babysat little boys eleven-year-old

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,190
boys squeal and streak a lot so I don't

00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:42,890
really know why they weren't at least in

00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:44,300
the earlier books so as I mentioned

00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:46,310
before one of the things I wanted to do

00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,960
was compare Hermione to Harry and Ron so

00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,670
you might be thinking well okay you know

00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:52,190
some of these words just on first pass

00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,510
look a little bit off but you know what

00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,500
about Harry and Ron like you didn't show

00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:59,450
us the words that were used to describe

00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:02,060
only them I just live for that so I made

00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:04,040
this table to explain the results across

00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,360
the top you've got the book numbers and

00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,620
then down the side you've got Harry Ron

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:11,510
and Hermione and so what this shows is

00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:14,480
the word that was used to describe them

00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:16,910
exclusively in the book that the column

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,720
represents and then in the frequency so

00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,220
you might be thinking here the

00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,930
frequencies quite low and that's because

00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,850
I was really conservative with how I did

00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:24,860
this I was only looking for verbs and

00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:27,230
adverbs and only in cases where they

00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,780
were located around a protagonist like

00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:31,580
actual name so it's a very kind of

00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:34,880
conservative sample but here a couple

00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:37,820
things that stick stood out to me for

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,190
Harry I think this makes sense Rowling

00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:42,020
uses him as the lens for the narrative

00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:44,570
so a lot of the words that are used only

00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:46,750
to talk about him are like thought and

00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:49,910
wondered and very sort of eternal

00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:52,790
concepts not all but it's pretty

00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,930
different than the other characters with

00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:56,600
Ron if you're again if you're familiar

00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:59,690
with the books Ron's a real Grouch like

00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,880
more so than most teenage boys and he

00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:03,350
there's a lot of stuff that's exclusive

00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,329
to him it's like groaning and moaning

00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:07,240
and complaining and being gruff and

00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:12,030
stuff like that which really does fit

00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:15,540
Ron right don't find me on that

00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:16,860
so Hermione what emerges for her well so

00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,060
going back to what I said the beginning

00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,800
I really thought Hermione was a great

00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,209
character she was so strong she leads

00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,800
the resistance she comes up with the

00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:24,060
whole resistance and makes Harry the

00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,730
leader of it which is a little bit weird

00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:29,520
but anyway I thought she'd be used with

00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:31,350
very heroic terms and a lot of them are

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,750
neutral but they're quite a few in there

00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:36,870
that echo what I said earlier squeaking

00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:38,820
squealing in book seven I highlighted

00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:40,620
that because I thought it was kind of

00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,380
especially unfortunate she's got

00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,570
squeaked shrilly breathes and breathless

00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,860
and squealing and you know I was just

00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,150
her like in that book she does so many

00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:51,810
great things and it was just so

00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:53,610
unfortunate to see that so what do I

00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:55,470
want you to take from this you can

00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:57,840
totally go out and analyze Harry Potter

00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:02,250
by yourself and tell me how I'm wrong if

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,780
you want I dare you but what I would

00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,310
really like you to take from this is

00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:09,540
what I mentioned at the very beginning

00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:12,720
about coded language and how people who

00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:14,340
work in tech and Beyond really do deal

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,530
with this all the time and they're very

00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,940
subtle language cues that I think

00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:20,070
sometimes we don't even notice I

00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,200
sincerely think JK Rowling did not

00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:23,910
notice that she was doing this I really

00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,800
do I I don't I don't think she was

00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:27,960
trying to do this but I think that it's

00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:31,530
so innate to a lot of us it's just how

00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:34,530
we sort of think that that it happens

00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:36,870
and so what I would ask is that you look

00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:39,020
for words like the ones on the screen to

00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:41,760
describe women and people of color

00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:43,860
people based on on their their sexual

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,530
preference and just be critical of them

00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:48,270
and really be thoughtful when you're

00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,910
when you're consuming media especially

00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:52,320
media that you love things like Harry

00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:54,480
Potter which I know a lot of people love

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,680
but it's not perfect and I think we need

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,360
to kind of keep that in mind especially

00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:01,890
when we're we're reading it to our kids

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:03,840
I definitely do so thank you for coming

00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,340
to this talk I really do appreciate it

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,770
once again that you stay until 5:00 p.m.

00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:10,320
that's really awesome

00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:11,760
I do a lot of projects around literature

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,220
and trying to use programming to

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,170
understand literature better I come from

00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,690
a literature family both my parents for

00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:21,990
college English professors which is

00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:24,540
probably a whole other talk but but yeah

00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,190
so I've really enjoyed doing this I did

00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,140
different presentation for PyCon about

00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:30,450
Gothic literature so if you're

00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,860
interested in this area I haven't I feel

00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:33,330
like really even scratch the surface of

00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:35,660
some of the tools that could be used to

00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:38,130
help folks out who are in those fields

00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:39,900
humanities Social Sciences journalism

00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:42,780
all that stuff if you're interested in

00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,910
the same sort of general realm please do

00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,330
look me up on Twitter thank you very

00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:51,360
much

00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:54,720
I just happened to be here but I

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,820
absolutely love this talk I'm kind of I

00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,080
just personally started doing a lot more

00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:04,880
writing myself and been thinking about

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:07,980
words and their meanings because and

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,890
some of their preconceived notions and

00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:15,290
as and I did a lightning talk earlier

00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:18,510
and the like when I kind of think of

00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:21,360
when I say here's Who I am it's like I

00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:23,100
am EDD and I have and I'm crazy these

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,770
are two words that were really crazy is

00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:28,050
such a been a word that's like stigma

00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:30,540
and there's been mental disorders in my

00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:33,000
family that have been labeled things and

00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:35,280
they're you know they have preconceived

00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,400
notions as being bad and where it's like

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,350
now I just see these words as they

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,780
describe me but I've changed their

00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:45,120
definition to me so where I'm like hey

00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:48,260
I'm crazy but I'm accepting of that and

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:51,870
I use it to do crazy awesome things and

00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:53,010
my ad D means that I don't really feel

00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,690
like doing that right now so I'm gonna

00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:57,060
do what I feel like doing and it charges

00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:58,190
me up and it lets me do something else

00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:01,920
like all of a sudden when I

00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:06,210
procrastinated one time at work I don't

00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:08,820
know my bosses in here I was writing got

00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:10,230
the flow just purged out this stuff in

00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,420
like half an hour as fast as I could

00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:16,140
type just type it away before he knew it

00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:17,760
then I was like got into work and got on

00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:20,340
to my world I was that work but I was

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,410
then doing my work work and I was in the

00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:26,820
flow and help me continue that flow into

00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:30,420
my work and and so these are just sorry

00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:32,850
this is a long question okay so words

00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:34,740
preconceived notions and how they change

00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:37,020
in through time and our deaf

00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,880
of things through time and our culture

00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:41,220
since the society has preconceived

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,860
notions of those words so answer how

00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,929
that whatever well so that's interesting

00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,450
so thanks for calling out the the health

00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:52,260
and and ableism generally I think that's

00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:55,049
important one too so so yeah so I think

00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:57,330
that one one bit of pushback I guess

00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:59,070
that I've had on this was that a few

00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:00,750
years back maybe three years ago there's

00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:04,649
this campaign to sort of reclaim bossy

00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:05,880
as a term and so I think you could maybe

00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:07,049
look at that lens but I think what's

00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,700
really important one thing I've learned

00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:10,020
doing this this type of work like

00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,029
looking at different literature from

00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,130
different eras is you do have to put the

00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:15,840
lens of the the time that it was written

00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:18,679
on it a little bit so even though bossy

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:22,080
may not feel pejorative to somebody now

00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:24,480
yeah exactly yeah even if it's to be

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,809
claimed it in the context of the time it

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,919
wasn't meant as a compliment so that I

00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:30,750
think that that's that's really

00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,309
important but I do also think I mean

00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:35,010
there's nothing inherently bad about

00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:36,929
squealing it's just the way that the

00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:39,960
context in which that word exists is so

00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:44,460
negative so first of all awesome talk

00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:47,070
this was extremely cool and I dug it my

00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:49,140
question is would it be easy to apply

00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:50,820
this process to non protagonist

00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:53,039
characters and the reason I'm asking is

00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:55,200
because it'd be super cool to see if

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,840
these trends were consistent among

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,010
multiple female characters or instead if

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,289
it was super specific to the

00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:03,059
characterization of Hermione mm-hmm yeah

00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:05,070
that's a great question so with the code

00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:06,539
is it exists now no it's not hard really

00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:08,399
all you have to change is the names of

00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:09,899
the protagonists and then you're good

00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:11,820
there's nothing built into the code

00:23:09,899 --> 00:23:13,919
about what is what is negative or

00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,409
pejorative so it's really up for some

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,210
interpretation but yeah you could add

00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:20,909
female characters you could do good

00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:23,159
versus evil kind of a comparison could

00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:25,140
be really interesting to it would be

00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:31,500
very very easy to do that with any

00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:32,820
characters sure yeah I get asked that

00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,159
actually quite a bit and like for

00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:38,130
example if JK Rowling is more sexist or

00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:39,990
less sexist than some other author you

00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:41,669
know if I can compare it that way

00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:44,779
so yeah you totally could haven't got

00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:44,779
around to yet maybe one

00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:49,699
