	Why we Worry About all the Wrong Things by Hilary Stohs-Krause

"Modern humans arenâ€™t great at risk assessment.

We often blithely ignore that which could harm us, and are conversely intimidated by things that are quite safe. This inability to recognize threat has vast implications for many aspects of our lives, including our careers.

Do you want to be less stressed? Make better decisions? Learn strategies for identifying (and dealing with!) unnecessary worry? Let's explore the root causes of fear and anxiety together, and discover how we can start to deliberately rewrite our instincts."
