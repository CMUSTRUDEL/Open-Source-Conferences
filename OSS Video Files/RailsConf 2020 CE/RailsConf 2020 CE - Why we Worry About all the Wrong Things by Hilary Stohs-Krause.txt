	Why we Worry About all the Wrong Things by Hilary Stohs-Krause

"Modern humans arenâ€™t great at risk assessment.

We often blithely ignore that which could harm us, and are conversely intimidated by things that are quite safe. This inability to recognize threat has vast implications for many aspects of our lives, including our careers.

Do you want to be less stressed? Make better decisions? Learn strategies for identifying (and dealing with!) unnecessary worry? Let's explore the root causes of fear and anxiety together, and discover how we can start to deliberately rewrite our instincts."

	00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:15,449
so today I'm gonna talk about why we

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,789
worry about all the wrong things I'm

00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:20,699
Hillary so screwsie I work at a real

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:23,070
shop in Madison Wisconsin I'm on Twitter

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,750
I graduated from a coding bootcamp and I

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,320
have a cinder in elvish tattoo for

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:31,289
anyone who's a Lord of the Rings fan so

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,629
really quick before I get too far I just

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,219
want to make a note that this talk does

00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:37,140
touch on mental health including anxiety

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,570
depression there are some images of

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,920
common fears I just like to kind of get

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:45,300
that that in front at the beginning and

00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,489
then some disclaimers I'm not a

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,320
therapist or a scientist I just find

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,079
this topic really fascinating and did a

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,720
lot of research on that note there are

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,489
two books in particular that I use a lot

00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,079
of material from and a lot of ideas and

00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,610
those are algorithms to live by the

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,770
computer science of human decisions and

00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,329
to thinking in bets making smarter

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,899
decisions when you don't have all the

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:09,659
facts so I really like this quote and I

00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:11,520
think this kind of summarizes a lot of

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,590
what we're going to talk about today and

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,049
it's some neuroscientist claim that

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,119
humans are the most fearful creatures on

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:23,090
the planet because of our ability to

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:25,579
learn think and create fear in our minds

00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,840
so first we're gonna look at some common

00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:29,549
misplaced fears and I want to kind of

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,170
say at the beginning that I don't really

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:36,119
like the phrasing of irrational fears

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,369
and we'll talk about this throughout the

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,329
presentation but there really aren't

00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:41,909
what we think of it you know it's not

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:45,299
really irrational like being afraid is a

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,819
rational emotion it's just misplaced

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,840
it's kind of the word that I like better

00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:49,939
so we're gonna look at a couple of those

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,729
right now

00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:55,079
your number one Oh

00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:58,079
so trying to find a picture of a cute

00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:00,479
spider right I didn't want to it want to

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,779
traumatize everyone super early in the

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,399
presentation but even given this this

00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:09,530
sort of fuzzy little creature you know

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:12,690
how many of us feel any sense of fear or

00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:15,030
tension when we encounter or think about

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:19,610
spiders probably a lot of us to a

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:22,300
greater or lesser degree right however

00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:26,260
what do you think the percentage

00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:28,540
of the 40,000 species of spiders is that

00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:31,690
our poisonous or venomous how many how

00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:34,810
many do you think there are it's not

00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:37,620
very many it's about 12 12 species out

00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:40,750
of 40,000 can actually cause us

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,290
legitimate harm and how many of those 12

00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,120
do you think are in the United States

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:50,530
too

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:52,480
right so we we sort of you know

00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,880
universally have this distaste for

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:59,140
spiders but they're so incredibly

00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:03,480
unlikely to do us any harm in fact

00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:07,210
you're more likely to be killed by cows

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:12,190
spiders kill on average seven people a

00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:15,760
year cows killed 20 so something to

00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:19,120
think about if you're number two this is

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,070
another really common one flying who

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:26,170
experiences any fear or anxiety about

00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:29,920
flying it's a lot of people however only

00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:32,730
one in 5.4 million flights on average

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,540
has any kind of major accident one in

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,820
5.4 million

00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,280
how many commercial airline flights in

00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:44,500
the US have had at least one fatality in

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,720
the last decade only one and we went

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,180
nine years without a single commercial

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,180
flight having any fatalities in the

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,370
United States in fact an average a

00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:59,050
passenger can take a flight every single

00:03:54,370 --> 00:04:01,060
day for 241 years before experiencing an

00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,739
accident with one fatality on board I

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,140
mean that's just mind-blowing

00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:06,640
right in fact you're more likely to be

00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,600
killed by I think a lot of people

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,480
probably know where I'm going with this

00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:15,370
one driving to the airport more than

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:19,030
38,000 people died in car crashes in the

00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:21,430
u.s. in just 2019 and we've only had one

00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:24,100
person die on a flight in the last

00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:26,560
decade your chances of dying in a

00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,450
vehicle are one in a hundred and three I

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,120
mean how many of us get into our cars

00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:34,479
and feel that similar sense of anxiety

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,150
or or fear probably not very many of us

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,700
some people don't even we're there

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:41,400
seat belt you happy thinking okay fine

00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:44,070
so spiders make me squeamish I get

00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,450
nervous on flights what's the big deal

00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,790
right you just told me I'm perfectly

00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:50,190
safe doing this thing so why does it

00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:52,380
matter if I'm just like a little extra

00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,990
nervous there are actually a lot of

00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:57,450
implications for our lives when we have

00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,760
this misplaced fear or this this

00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,900
unnecessary anxiety and worry so we're

00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,810
gonna look at what what some of those

00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:06,000
impacts are right now first I want to

00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:08,010
talk about the risk perception gap so

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,320
this is a gap between things we think

00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:13,470
could happen and then what's actually

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:18,240
happening and that that gap can be

00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:21,180
enormous it leads to wasted emotional

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,090
mental and physical energy right if we

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,280
are worrying about things unnecessarily

00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:29,220
we're spending a lot of of cognition and

00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,880
a lot of emotion that we really don't

00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:35,610
need to so it's it's wasted it means

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,010
were blindsided by actual threats right

00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:40,770
if we're too focused on something we

00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:43,710
think might be happening or could be

00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:46,410
happening we have all of all of that

00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,870
attention and awareness and energy that

00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:52,590
we aren't able to focus on what actually

00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:54,450
is happening and it can lead to poor

00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,400
decision-making right if we're making

00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:59,040
decisions based on perceived threats

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,700
instead of actual threats we're missing

00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:05,730
a huge part of the puzzle there are also

00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:08,430
health concerns weakened immune system

00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:11,150
damage to our hearts causing ulcers

00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:14,070
decreased fertility and this isn't just

00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:15,390
obviously one instance of being anxious

00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,730
about something that we didn't need to

00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:18,510
be you're being worried about something

00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:22,040
unnecessarily right these are more

00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:24,600
symptoms of long term stress and anxiety

00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,600
but that all starts with those those

00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,940
individual pieces can lead to

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,850
accelerated aging even premature death

00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,620
and it impairs the formation of long

00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,840
term memories and this makes sense we

00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,970
think about folks who've experienced

00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,370
deep trauma I have a hard time recalling

00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:43,230
in any detail exactly what happened or

00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,580
the situation surrounding it and we'll

00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,350
get into in a little bit when we talk

00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:49,800
about how force created we'll look at

00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:53,099
why that might be and then work

00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:56,729
issues right so self-selecting out of

00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:59,460
opportunities is a huge one if there is

00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:01,020
an open position at your job or a new

00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:04,590
project and they're looking for folks to

00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:07,080
work on it and you're worried about you

00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:10,139
know your skill set or how it might come

00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,330
off or the politics or any number of

00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,919
things then you might decide I'm just

00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,569
you know what that's for someone else

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,379
that's not for me I'm not gonna do that

00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:22,800
and you might be a great fit but until

00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:24,330
we're able to better determine what are

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,159
you know again those are real or

00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,949
perceived threats it makes it really

00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:32,009
hard to make accurate decisions for

00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:34,740
things like that holding back your team

00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:36,150
so this is related right if you have

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,949
those same fears and concerns

00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,810
it can affect not just you but your

00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:41,849
entire your entire office your entire

00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:45,300
team and then this one I thought was

00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:48,930
really interesting when we're feeling

00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,909
stress and anxiety and fear those

00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:53,520
emotions actually interrupt processes

00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:55,229
that can help us act ethically and when

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,750
you think about it again this makes a

00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:59,219
lot of sense

00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,449
we talk a lot about like fight or flight

00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:03,150
you know those kind of instinctual

00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:07,620
reactions that we have when we're in

00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:10,169
that that mindset our primary concern is

00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,759
how do we get out of it right how do we

00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:14,090
stay alive how do we get out of it how

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,219
do we survive which is a good thing

00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:19,020
broadly speaking but then it puts us

00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:22,319
into this very self-centered frame of

00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:24,330
mind right how do I get out of this you

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,639
just think about when you know maybe

00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:29,099
maybe you've been in a car accident and

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,020
every time that you see a car in that

00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:32,430
similar position you feel that that

00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,199
heightened sense of or it's right maybe

00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:36,360
your heart rate increases your blood

00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:39,899
pressure gets higher your palms get

00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,250
sweaty you know your mind is racing you

00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:45,000
just you tense up right and it's really

00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:46,740
hard to make thoughtful deliberative

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,060
decisions when we're when we're feeling

00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,240
fear and anxiety when we're in that

00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,680
frame of mind and then the tension

00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,260
between perfect and dunt this is another

00:08:52,680 --> 00:09:00,089
big one right again if we are if we are

00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:03,510
spending that emotional and and physical

00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:07,620
and cognitive energy worrying

00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:09,690
and having fear then we can it can lead

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,070
us to fixate on things and so instead of

00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:13,500
just being you know what I feel

00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,030
confident in what I'm doing or I I know

00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,910
what my real threats are and this is not

00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:21,140
one of them you know I'm confident that

00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:23,010
this is good enough I got it done versus

00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,440
worrying that everything has to be

00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:29,220
perfect because of what the be perceived

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,440
or real you know outcomes could be okay

00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,750
so you see my point right there's a lot

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,730
about things that come if we have you

00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,810
know unnecessary worry and anxiety and

00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:42,060
fear great well what do I do about it

00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:45,900
first I want us to look at where do fear

00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:48,480
and anxiety come from starts in our

00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:50,550
brains right first up is the amygdala

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,770
this is what processes our emotions so

00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:54,750
fear is inherently an emotional reaction

00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,510
first and foremost and it's really

00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:59,490
important to understand how this works

00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:01,530
the amygdala also starts the process of

00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,780
the physical preparation so releases

00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:06,390
stress hormones fires up our sympathetic

00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:08,970
nervous system you know this is why even

00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:10,850
when we when we do realize okay false

00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:13,650
alarm that thing isn't dangerous

00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:15,510
we still end up with sweaty palms that

00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,040
adrenaline rush that rapid heart rate

00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:20,070
because that happens before we make that

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,080
decision next we go to the hippocampus

00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:24,150
this is where we store memories and this

00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,920
is crucial for contextualizing our fears

00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,540
have we encountered this before what

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,650
happened is this a new thing this is

00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,120
similar to other things that we've

00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:32,580
encountered before has someone told us

00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,750
about this before and this goes back to

00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:38,010
that point I made earlier where

00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:40,830
long-term fear stress anxiety or acute

00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:43,440
stress and anxiety impairs our ability

00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:46,100
to form memories because our memory

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,140
center is part of our fear response and

00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:51,360
then finally after we've had this

00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,520
emotional reaction and then access to

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,860
our memories that's when we get to our

00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,660
prefrontal cortex and this is the part

00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,640
of our brain that is responsible for

00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,900
complex cognitive behavior and

00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:05,970
decision-making so all of these other

00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:10,920
parts happen before we even get to

00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:13,590
decision-making so basically our

00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:17,490
thinking circuitry of the brain has to

00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:20,399
reassure our emotional area our

00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:22,620
default is to be afraid and then our

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,120
thinking brain finally gets around

00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,370
analyzes and says no no no we're cool

00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,740
plus alarm stand down everything's good

00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,330
but we've already had that emotional

00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,770
reaction I think that's really important

00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,850
to keep in mind and a little bit we're

00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,740
gonna talk about the difference between

00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:40,070
the deliberative mind and the reflexive

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:41,760
mind there are three main types of fear

00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:44,420
anticipatory right

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,560
fearing things that could happen

00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,810
biological which are sort of these

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,310
ingrained fears that we have that it

00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:53,430
seems like everyone does the fears that

00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:55,410
feel like instinctual and then lived

00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:57,630
experience so what has happened that we

00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:59,490
have learned to be afraid of like the

00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:01,709
car example if you've been an accident a

00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:03,570
lot of people experience sort of

00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:05,700
lingering fear when they encounter

00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:08,510
similar situations to when they got into

00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:11,910
an accident and I can last for years and

00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:14,520
then what can amplify our fear because

00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,839
fear isn't just something that happens

00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,670
and it's a certain level and it stays

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,410
and it's gone there are actually various

00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,060
factors that can increase the level of

00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,740
fear we're feeling so there's a

00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,940
professor in Joann Cantor actually from

00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,180
the University of wisconsin-madison

00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:30,779
where I live and she studied what are

00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:32,250
the themes that tend to give people the

00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:33,870
most people that you know this this

00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,220
greater sense of fear and so she

00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,290
basically had people watch scary movies

00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,660
and then kind of recorded how they were

00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:41,700
feeling she found that they were there

00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,410
were three in particular that really

00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,850
stood out one was disturbing visual

00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:48,480
images which makes sense that seems

00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:50,820
pretty obvious imminent threat right so

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,470
again anticipatory that fear of like

00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,870
what we expect is going to happen or

00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:58,800
could happen and then the third was lack

00:12:54,870 --> 00:13:01,649
of control which I thought was was

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,050
interesting I didn't expect that other

00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:05,700
people can amplify our fear it's called

00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,980
emotional contagion or cultural

00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,660
cognition there are three studies that I

00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:13,370
read that talked about this phenomena so

00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:16,770
all of them the most part involved sweat

00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:18,839
which is fun the first they had people

00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:21,240
wear t-shirts while running on a

00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:25,140
treadmill and then skydiving so two

00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,540
forms of active activity but very

00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:31,200
different context when they had other

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:33,090
people smell the shirts there

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,250
doulas were much more active when they

00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:37,800
were smelling the shirts worn while

00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,660
skydiving they did the same thing they

00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,670
had students in university wear t-shirts

00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:45,240
during an exam a stressful situation

00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:47,030
versus lecture which is more calm then

00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,250
they had dental students perform

00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:52,590
procedures on mannequins wearing those

00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,880
shirts and they found that that the

00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:56,790
students that I'm gonna quote here

00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,260
performed significantly worse when

00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:00,740
treating mannequins wearing t-shirts

00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:03,990
from people who'd been stressed so

00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:07,230
dentists can smell your fear which is

00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:11,010
awesome and then the third one they had

00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:12,990
man men wear t-shirts while watching the

00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:15,000
shining and then they had men wear

00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:17,130
t-shirt while watching non scary movies

00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,640
and then they had women smell those

00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:22,530
shirts and women reacted without

00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,240
thinking right this instinctual reaction

00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:26,790
they they open their eyes wide

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,250
they had a scared expression when they

00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:31,790
unknowingly smelled the t-shirts from

00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:34,740
the men who've been watching the shiny

00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:38,100
so we can we can pass our fear on to

00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:42,900
other people and then fear itself we

00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:46,080
actually just by being scared we're sort

00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:48,750
of prone to become more scared so for

00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,670
example if you're watching a documentary

00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,530
about let's say spiders and you feel a

00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:54,000
loose thread on your sweater in the back

00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,650
of your neck and we have a much more

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,690
heightened reaction to that than we

00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:59,970
would if we were watching I don't know

00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:01,350
what documentary about kittens if you're

00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,720
flying and you're already feeling

00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:05,700
nervous and then there's turbulence

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,200
again even if you know you're probably

00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,100
gonna be fine and even if the pilot is

00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,870
like hey we're gonna have mild

00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,880
turbulence this is normal we're going

00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:14,790
through you know a bit of patch a wind

00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:17,730
that still increases your sense of

00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:19,440
anxiety and fear or if you're at a job

00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:21,630
and you get called to the boss's office

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,890
even again if you know you're doing fine

00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:27,780
there's nothing that should be wrong

00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:30,170
just that act of being called in can

00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:32,340
heighten our sense of anxiety or worry

00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:34,260
which is actually why it ten-forward we

00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,370
like to say you know hey can I talk to

00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,870
you for a second you're not fired

00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,730
what started it's kind of a joke but you

00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,110
realize that that just that active like

00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:43,230
hey everything's good you're not fired

00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:44,819
again that's sort of like reassuring

00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,619
that emotional part of

00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:48,509
people's brains that everything is fine

00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:51,059
because instinctually

00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:53,009
we react emotionally and we are react

00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:54,660
with fear so doing doing you know small

00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:55,739
things like that to justice which people

00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,429
experience like hey everything's fine

00:15:55,739 --> 00:16:01,439
don't worry about it what factors can

00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:02,910
cause us to overestimate risk right we

00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:05,339
talked about that risk perception gap

00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:08,819
between what is perceived and actual and

00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:10,769
there are eight different factors or

00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:14,189
components that they've identified that

00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:16,589
that are that lead us to overestimate

00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:18,509
risk about something catastrophic

00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:20,399
potential right so a lot of people

00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:22,739
affected at once rather than in small

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,419
numbers over time which is why a lot of

00:16:22,739 --> 00:16:27,119
folks were really worried about a

00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:30,179
terrorist attack after 9/11 a lot of

00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:32,459
people affected all at once rather than

00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:34,339
you know lead poisoning which to be Co

00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:37,109
which which hasn't really become a thing

00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:40,519
until more recently or the the the

00:16:37,109 --> 00:16:43,799
perception of it being a risk right

00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:46,049
familiarity so if there's something that

00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:47,189
isn't common knowledge like oh yeah did

00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:49,289
you know like a hundred people died from

00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:51,769
this last year what I had no idea that

00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:54,269
increases our sense of risk

00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:57,059
understanding which is related this is

00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:58,889
something that not only do we not know

00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:01,759
much about but that experts don't

00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:03,929
understand either so a lot of these

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,089
you'll see how they kind of relate to

00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:07,559
cope in nineteen right something that

00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:09,269
that we don't want to understand

00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,709
personal control is another one we found

00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:13,110
that with the film's right professor

00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:16,319
Joanne canter lack of control is a key

00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:18,720
theme that leads us to feel fear if

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,449
there's a sense that a danger is outside

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,990
of our control that elevates our sense

00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:26,519
of risk voluntariness right something

00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:29,149
that can hurt us even when we aren't

00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:32,159
voluntarily putting ourselves in danger

00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:33,570
like a pandemic you can stay home you

00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:35,759
can follow all the rules and you can

00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,529
still get sick children

00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:41,519
I mentioned the world children and panic

00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:44,730
multiplies victim identity this is a big

00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:46,200
one right if um you know and it kind of

00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,870
goes back to that catastrophic potential

00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,879
if a million people die we can't even

00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:54,539
process that right but if our neighbor

00:17:50,879 --> 00:17:57,779
dies or if our grandmother gets sick or

00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:58,230
if our kids best friend you know has an

00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:01,049
acciden

00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:04,470
that victim identity causes us to to

00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:07,220
feel like the risk is greater and then

00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:09,150
origin this again really surprised me

00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,350
although I guess maybe it shouldn't with

00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,990
the way that a lot of us react to

00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:15,840
climate change but we view man-made

00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:17,630
risks as more dangerous than natural

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:23,460
disasters so again

00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:25,080
terrorism versus climate change so

00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,880
although this kind of goes to show that

00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:31,410
our risk assessment process is kind of

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:34,950
outdated right it evolved in a natural

00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:40,250
environment where a lot of things could

00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:43,350
kill us you know predators lack of food

00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:45,929
storms I mean we we were really quite

00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:48,390
fragile in a lot of ways and so fear was

00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:51,150
crucial for allowing our species to

00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:55,470
survive and continue and then concrete

00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:59,640
versus abstract fears or dangers right

00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:01,830
so again that idea that someone coming

00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,450
in with you with a knife that's a very

00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:05,340
clear threat we have learned to

00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:08,130
recognize that as a very clear threat

00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:10,919
but I you know something like climate

00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:12,960
change that's just it's so abstract that

00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:16,919
our brains aren't generally evolved to

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:19,230
process that kind of threat and then

00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:20,250
things that give us vague rewards so

00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:22,049
there's this computational

00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,700
neuroscientist Anders Sandberg who works

00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:25,799
at the future humanity Institute at

00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,809
Oxford University and he says the

00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:30,299
problem is that modern dangers like

00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:32,130
climate change are incredibly abstract

00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:34,950
it's not even clear to us that there's

00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:36,660
any benefit to being scared you can't do

00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,809
anything except feel bad about it

00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:42,900
by comparison being scared of a wolf has

00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:45,480
a reward surviving which makes it

00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:48,450
worthwhile on this idea that there are

00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:51,179
so many abstract issues in our complex

00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:53,040
modern world and we don't know what to

00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:54,510
be afraid of and so it's easier to just

00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,299
fixated on the things that seem like

00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:58,650
clear and present dangers and to really

00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:01,049
hone all of our fear and anxiety on

00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:03,480
those even if our society is kind of

00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:05,820
outgrown that as being a fear our brains

00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:09,630
haven't so that's kind of depressing

00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:11,490
right and we are we're we're not great

00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,179
at recognizing what we should be afraid

00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:15,010
of

00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:16,419
that's just the fact but there are

00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,820
things we can do about that right so

00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:20,350
let's dive into some of those some

00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,150
strategies for adapting so these are

00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:24,250
some tools that you can use to sort of

00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:26,200
decrease your fear and make better risk

00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,970
assessments what should I be afraid of

00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,740
what should give me anxiety what should

00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,330
I worry about and should is a very

00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,710
dangerous word right because again we

00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,289
have the brains that we were born with

00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:37,059
and so it's not about overcoming our

00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:40,270
brains that's that's just not a thing

00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:41,679
but and also it's okay to be afraid I

00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,100
think this is crucial to talk about too

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,539
right

00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,460
it's okay to be afraid it's a sign that

00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:48,010
our brains and bodies are working the

00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,270
way that they should be the rule like

00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,260
the key here the thing that I really

00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:52,330
want to try to get at in this

00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:55,120
presentation is we don't have to let

00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:56,530
those those facts the way that our brain

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,059
processes fear all these things that are

00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:00,250
true we don't have to let them exert

00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:03,490
undue influence over our lives and

00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:05,289
decisions and really being aware of how

00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:09,309
it all works I think it makes it easier

00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:12,070
to do that so again kind of on that note

00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:13,720
don't blame yourself right

00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:16,000
we're uncomfortable with the idea that

00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,580
luck plays a significant role in our

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,020
lives and this comes from that that how

00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,000
to make better decisions book and that

00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:24,220
was written by a woman who has a

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,860
neuroscience PhD and was a professional

00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:31,090
gambler and talks a lot about this idea

00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:33,429
that you know we can have the best

00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:34,570
decision possible like before we know

00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:35,770
what the outcome is you could you could

00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:37,600
pass the decision around you know all

00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,830
the data the decision you made pass it

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,750
around 200 people they would all say yes

00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:42,700
that's the best decision way to go

00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:45,549
that's awesome and it might still turn

00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:48,250
out terribly and that's not your fault

00:21:45,549 --> 00:21:51,250
that's just the result of a million

00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:52,990
factors that we can't control so again

00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:55,659
you know this idea of controls come up

00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:58,330
several times so just kind of becoming

00:21:55,659 --> 00:22:00,600
okay with a Natalie's having control

00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:04,150
over things and trying to accept that

00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:06,730
because we don't and the quality of the

00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,870
outcome is not equal to the quality of

00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:10,210
the decision this is something I think

00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:11,559
about a lot so let's try to reframe you

00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,909
know what does success look like right

00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:15,669
now let's focus only on what we can

00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:17,049
control so first things first I

00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:18,610
mentioned this earlier in the

00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:22,360
presentation the reflexive versus

00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:25,520
deliberative mind so we make thousands

00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,770
of decisions a day right you know

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,960
do I sneeze my alarm do I get up maybe

00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:31,850
the bed do I get out of do I make the

00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,160
bed after I get out what am I gonna wear

00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,390
today should I check the weather or

00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,370
should I just look out the window I mean

00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,540
there were thousands of decisions we

00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:40,040
don't even think about most of them

00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:43,010
because we do them kind of instinctively

00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,630
and if we did deliberate on all of them

00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:46,910
and weigh the pros and cons and look at

00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:49,370
data I mean we'd never get anything done

00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:51,020
right we don't so probably likely die

00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:53,210
because that reflexive that

00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:55,190
instantaneous decision-making part of

00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:59,420
our brain is crucial for high-stress

00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:01,130
situations like again driving if there's

00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,810
a car coming towards us that we think

00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,010
might hit us we're not gonna stop there

00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:05,930
thing okay well what's the angle they're

00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:08,180
coming at and the speed where the

00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:10,490
pedestrians nearby what are my options

00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,480
you know if I'm going this fast can I

00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,130
calculate some kind of trajectory

00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,720
that'll keep me out of the path of the

00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:17,210
oncoming car right we would definitely

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,770
die we just don't have time for that and

00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:20,720
so that reflects the brain that sort of

00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:22,400
takes over and says we're doing this now

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,910
this is the best course of action for

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,490
our survival

00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:29,870
that's crucial we need that we need

00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:31,280
those shortcuts so the challenge is not

00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:34,640
to change the way that our brains

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:37,400
operate and this again comes from from

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,870
that neuroscientist PhD the challenge is

00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,540
not to change the way our brains operate

00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:43,490
but to figure out how to work within the

00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:45,920
limitations of the brains we already

00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:48,020
have and so again it's not a matter of

00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,330
like well maybe I just need to analyze

00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:52,250
more and rely less on that reflexive

00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:55,070
part of my brain I mean hey we can't

00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:57,050
really right and we need that reflects

00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:58,460
that part of our brain it's just it's

00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:00,530
realizing that the reflects that part is

00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,120
happening kind of watching for it and

00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:03,920
then being able to pull in the

00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,200
deliberative part of your mind when

00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:09,530
necessary to kind of counterbalance that

00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:13,280
reflexive part being prepared is a big

00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:14,480
way to do this right but planning is not

00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,480
the same as doing so we're gonna look at

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,480
some six quick 63% of Americans worry

00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,550
about natural disasters 78% see the

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,130
value of an emergency supply kit for

00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:26,270
survival it makes sense how many people

00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:30,950
do you think have actually started to

00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:35,120
put together one of those kids 26% and I

00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:37,100
think any developer who has a a or

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,380
multiple side project sitting around

00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:43,820
unfinished knows exactly what that feels

00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:44,930
like own what you do and don't know and

00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,190
we kind of talked about this earlier

00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:48,560
right there's only so much that we can

00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:50,690
control every decision is a kind of

00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,700
prediction and every prediction involves

00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:54,290
thinking about two separate things what

00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,510
you do and don't know there's a lot we

00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:57,920
don't know so we should look look out

00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:00,500
for win for your anxiety might be

00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,180
overriding what we do know but also

00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:05,990
recognize that they're going to be gaps

00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:07,700
in our experience all right now we're

00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:09,050
going to go to some algorithms so this

00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,910
subsection realized heavily on the book

00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:12,200
I mentioned earlier algorithms to live

00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,820
via the computer science of human

00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,550
decision so if you want to read that

00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:18,290
book just you no spoilers it's a mix of

00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:21,350
algorithms and then general CS concepts

00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:22,850
that can be applied to our lives to help

00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:25,490
us make better decisions and analyze

00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:27,920
risk optimal stopping how do we know

00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,360
when something is good enough so a

00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,800
threshold rule system more options

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,900
longer you wait for the best or eight if

00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,890
we have 40 applicants for a job we're

00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,360
probably not going to take the first

00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:36,370
person that just doesn't make a lot of

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,840
sense

00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:40,070
we often pick too early though so I

00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,110
think about this when I'm looking for a

00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:43,460
parking spot right it's like I see an

00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:45,590
open spot I'm like oh I should just grab

00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,750
that one right away but I know I'm

00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:48,950
probably picking too early and if I wait

00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:52,910
just a little bit longer if I'm a little

00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:54,110
more patient I'll get a better spot it's

00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:57,170
option it's window however at the

00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:58,550
flipside be prepared to hire hire anyone

00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:00,050
who's simply better than average take

00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:04,340
whatever parking spot is better than

00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:08,600
average you know know when no one it's

00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:10,070
time to pick explore exploit so do we

00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,330
take a chance on something new or stick

00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:14,660
with something that we know we already

00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:16,160
like our goal should change as we age so

00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,140
when we're younger and we have a lot

00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:21,740
more time the idea is that we should do

00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:23,960
more exploring because we have all that

00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,670
time ahead of us to do the exploitation

00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,800
which sounds bad but that's just the

00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:29,630
words that use right - so try although

00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,160
the restaurants when you first move to

00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:33,950
it sound cuz theoretically you're gonna

00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:35,150
be there for at least a year instead of

00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,710
just finding one place you like and

00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:38,750
going all the time because the chances

00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:40,370
are every other place you try has a

00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:41,750
really good chance of being your new

00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:44,780
favorite or being better than the one

00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:46,190
you've tried just based on odds so

00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:48,140
explore when you have time to use the

00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:52,519
resulting knowledge exploit when you're

00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:55,679
ready to cash in Wednesday loose shift

00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:57,450
choose an option at random and don't

00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,750
change until it stops working which

00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:02,820
sounds so is simplistic right but it

00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:05,279
actually performs reliably better than

00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:07,260
chance so we did this at the office we

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,519
had an issue where people would take the

00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:11,700
last Lacroix out of the box in the

00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:14,340
fridge and not put a new one in and we

00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:16,380
weren't sure how to make that better and

00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,730
it's a small problem right but I was

00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,960
talking to a colleague and he was saying

00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,370
well we could do this so we could do

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,870
that or what if we think about this or

00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,919
do we know are there certain people who

00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,779
drink it more and I was like this is

00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:27,179
you're way overthinking this it's just

00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:29,519
Lacroix why don't we just take it out of

00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:31,260
the box put the cans directly in the

00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:33,029
fridge so you can see more clearly when

00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,830
you've taken the last one and see what

00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:39,510
happens and if it doesn't work we'll try

00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:42,630
something else and it worked less

00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:44,549
recently use that's what I love so this

00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:46,679
basically gives everyone permission to

00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:47,940
have piles and junk drawers around you

00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:49,230
know when people will say oh you know

00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:52,080
it's not messy it's organized chaos

00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:53,519
they're actually right turns out that

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,500
junk doors and piles are one of the most

00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:58,559
well-designed and efficient structures

00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:00,720
available and the reason why is that our

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:04,019
eyes can search much more quickly than

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:07,169
our hands can sort or organize so they

00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:08,490
do the set libraries the most likely to

00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:10,769
be desired books are the ones that were

00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:14,159
most recently checked out so they tend

00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:16,380
to put those at the front I think about

00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,330
this when I'm organizing my desk a lot

00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,519
so a it's given me sort of like

00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:24,450
guilt-free reason to continue with my

00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:25,950
organized chaos of piles but also like I

00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:27,659
used post-its a lot and so I think

00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:29,429
whatever I last looked up and make a

00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:31,019
post-it and I put it right by my desk

00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:33,090
because there's a chance I'm gonna need

00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:35,399
that again very soon how many of us have

00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:37,769
Stack Overflow questions that we've

00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:40,289
basically bookmarked because we refer to

00:28:37,769 --> 00:28:42,690
them time and again right so finding a

00:28:40,289 --> 00:28:44,250
way to to recognize what is the

00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:46,440
information that I probably use a lot

00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:48,779
and just keep it close and it tends to

00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,039
be really whatever you guys looked at

00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:53,220
you're gonna need again probably pretty

00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:58,380
soon constraint relaxation this one

00:28:53,220 --> 00:29:02,250
again has really strong applications for

00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:04,200
working in tech so it posits in an ideal

00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:06,250
world take a problem that seems really

00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,990
complicated and impossible to solve

00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:11,320
and in an ideal world what would you do

00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:13,600
break it down

00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:16,000
solve it and then slowly add your

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,890
problems back in or the the constraints

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,240
right the difficulties so it's a lot

00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,470
like taking a large user story and

00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,870
breaking it down into concrete chunks

00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:24,160
like okay well do we need you know does

00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:26,020
this part of the feature have to exhibit

00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:29,590
is it didn't exist here's what I would

00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:31,990
do now I have this space okay how can I

00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:34,120
adjust this base for this difficult part

00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:36,220
that that also is part of this story

00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,650
taking complicated problems one step at

00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:42,070
a time

00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:46,650
information Cascades so this is when we

00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:49,540
equate what someone is doing with why

00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:51,750
actions are not beliefs this is really

00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:54,790
good especially if we're thinking about

00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:56,560
user data or if we're dealing with

00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:58,390
clients who want certain features you

00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,790
know it's not like what they're doing is

00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:02,800
only part of what we need to be looking

00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:05,290
at to find a solution it's also why so

00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,730
how many people have had you know notice

00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:08,350
a user doing something been like why are

00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:10,330
they even do it like that's not what

00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:12,100
that's built for it's like right it's

00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:13,360
not and they're doing it anyway and

00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,130
they're probably trying to get at

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,460
something else other than what their

00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:20,920
action might suggest so really focusing

00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:24,210
you're not just what but why and that

00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:26,200
helps us to make a lot better decisions

00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:28,650
and then I want to talk a little bit

00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:31,780
about cognitive behavioral therapy and

00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:34,450
kind of lessons from this field that can

00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:37,060
apply to decision-making and managing

00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:39,070
fear and anxiety and again not a

00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:42,220
therapist just talk to a therapist and

00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:44,590
did research so a big thing that comes

00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:47,590
from cognitive behavioral therapy is the

00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:50,050
idea of reframing right so considering

00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:52,660
something an opportunity to grow versus

00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:56,530
a loss of control or a challenge versus

00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:58,180
an obstacle and we might think that it's

00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:59,680
just words doesn't really make a

00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:02,500
difference this just seems literally

00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,810
semantics but so many studies have shown

00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,220
that the way we talk about things even

00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:09,700
just the way that we think about things

00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:12,310
has a huge impact on our emotions our

00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,900
mental health how we approach things it

00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:17,200
makes such a difference so words are

00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,870
super super important and then being

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,350
specific

00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:22,910
so it's easy to feel you know especially

00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:24,470
right now there are there are so many

00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:26,059
times during this pandemic where I just

00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:28,850
feel overwhelmed I think about all of

00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:31,610
the things that I want to do or feel

00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:33,050
like I should do or need to do all the

00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:34,700
things that are outside of my control

00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:37,520
again lack of control you know it's a

00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:40,250
very common theme for causing fear and

00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,960
anxiety and in humans and it's just easy

00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:43,910
to feel overwhelmed but if instead I

00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,610
focus on specific things that I do have

00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:49,610
control over that I can change that I

00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:52,040
can get done being more more micro

00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:54,110
goal-oriented it really makes a big

00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:56,330
difference on not only my ability to get

00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:58,280
things done but also just how I feel

00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:02,360
generally about about my control and

00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:05,059
about what's going on so there are four

00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,420
main steps that are kind of part of the

00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:10,550
the cognitive behavior therapy process

00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:11,540
first identifying right what is it

00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:13,400
that's causing us fear and anxiety

00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:16,220
because if we don't know if we just have

00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:18,050
this sort of broad sense of stress and

00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,610
anxiety it's really hard to take any

00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:22,040
action on it so kind of kind of sitting

00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:26,270
with it and trying to identify what is

00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:28,700
actually causing this for me being aware

00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:31,070
right how now that I know what it is how

00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:33,080
am I thinking about it what are my

00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:36,260
emotions that are associated with this

00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,790
what do I believe about this recognizing

00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:40,010
patterns that could be contributing

00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:42,170
right so looking for some of those fear

00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:45,110
amplifiers things that are that are

00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:47,179
making your anxiety or your stress or

00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:49,730
your fear thing that are increasing it

00:32:47,179 --> 00:32:51,320
and then finally that reframing we

00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:52,850
talked about right and this is a

00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,140
difficult step like you can have

00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:57,530
long-standing ways of thinking about

00:32:54,140 --> 00:33:01,670
yourself your life your job and it takes

00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:03,740
a lot of practice but with time these

00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:05,420
behavior patterns you know these new

00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,760
behavior patterns can replace your old

00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:10,610
ones and the longer you do it the less

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,350
effort it takes so focusing on reshaping

00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:13,820
reframing how do you feel about the

00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:16,100
thing what are you thinking about it

00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:19,280
how do you react to it you know and then

00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:22,610
there really it's just little steps over

00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:26,060
time for all of these that we can use to

00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:28,370
to kind of push back against some of

00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:31,650
those processes that that are primed to

00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:33,630
make us fearful and anxious

00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:35,370
ask for help right we talked about

00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:38,370
emotional contagion social cognition

00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:39,900
right how fear can spread other emotions

00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:41,190
can spread to right use that to your

00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,740
advantage when you see someone laughing

00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:45,510
you smile when someone yawns you yawn

00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:48,120
right they it doesn't just have to be

00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:49,940
spreading fear can be spreading auntie

00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:53,310
fear if you will

00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:56,670
sharing for your lessons it if you're

00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:59,810
afraid and you talk to one person you

00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:02,550
almost always feel a little bit better

00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:04,560
it also helps us gain perspective right

00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:06,900
so again we are limited to kind of our

00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:09,030
own experiences and so maybe our brain

00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,860
encounters something new and without

00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:12,750
having that prior experience or you know

00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,980
our default is to sort of be afraid but

00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,960
if we talk to someone else who has been

00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:18,030
through a similar situation suddenly we

00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,640
have more context it's not just about

00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:23,190
what we don't know we now know more than

00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:25,340
we did before and that helps to helps us

00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:27,480
to to create that better risk perception

00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:29,850
and it can pull us out of our bubble

00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:32,610
right it's very easy I think again you

00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:34,020
know this is this is a great period for

00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:35,179
this talk I guess because a lot of this

00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:38,040
is playing out in real life

00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:40,590
it's easy to just kind of be holed up by

00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:42,000
yourself in your home and kind of

00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:44,310
trapped with your own thoughts and

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,200
feelings but talking to others asking

00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:50,850
for help it can pull us out of there and

00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:53,100
kind of kind of you know switch from

00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:54,990
that that sort of reflexive emotion

00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:58,200
based brain to more of our deliberative

00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:59,370
analytical brain and like actually look

00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,220
at what we're feeling and how we're

00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:04,560
reacting and determine is this accurate

00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:07,140
is it you know do I have enough

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:10,490
information how are other people dealing

00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:13,320
with this in ways that might help me I

00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:15,230
really love this quote we're willing to

00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,610
accept solutions that are close enough

00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:21,620
then even some of the hairiest problems

00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:21,620
can be tamed with the right techniques

00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:27,570
and that's all I have thanks for

00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:29,840
listening if you have any questions or

00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:33,090
thoughts or comments I find this whole

00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:34,860
area really fascinating I'd love to hear

00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:38,100
from you I'm on Twitter you can also

00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:42,330
send me an email and then I have all of

00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:44,790
my citations here and then here are my

00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:44,930
slides for anyone who wants to be able

00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:47,270
to

00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:50,119
click the links to those citations and

00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:53,450
and do some more digging on their own

00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:56,990
thanks to Rios comp for putting this on

00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:58,819
as a as a sort of virtual conference I

00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,770
think it's great that that they put so

00:35:58,819 --> 00:36:01,970
much work in and didn't just cancel it

00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:04,430
and throw up their hands and say well we

00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:06,200
tried I think it's really fantastic that

00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:07,400
they they put all this work into to

00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,559
making this happen so that we can all

00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,700
still you know kind of feel like we we

00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:14,710
came together even if we didn't in

00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:14,710
