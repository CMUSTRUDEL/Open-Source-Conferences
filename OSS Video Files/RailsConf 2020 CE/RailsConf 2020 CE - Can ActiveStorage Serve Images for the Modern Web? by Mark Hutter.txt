	Can ActiveStorage Serve Images for the Modern Web? by Mark Hutter

"It’s a simple question: can ActiveStorage be used for image serving in your modern web apps? The answer is not so simple. Can it handle the speed requirements and size specifications of images that the modern web browsers deems as “fast”?

We’ll look at the out-of-the-box approach ActiveStorage takes on asset serving, where it works well - resizing, usability, and security, and where we run into rough edges - image load times, CDN integration, and next gen image format storage. And then we’ll look at one pattern working in production today."
