	Communicating with Cops by Kyle d'Oliveira

"As the number of developers grows within an organization, how do you keep others informed of best practices, or patterns that caused problems in the past? Is there a lot of tribal knowledge or documentation that developers need to memorize? That is a recipe for cognitive overload.

Alternatively, we can use Rubocop to codify some best practices or common traps to avoid. This talk will dive into how Rubocop can be used to not only enforce styling but also keep problematic patterns out, while also providing the motivation and context for enforcing it."

Based in Vancouver, Canada, Kyle is a jack of all trades and a master of some; at least he thinks so. He works as a staff software developer to readily turn abstract ideas into working pieces of software. He has worked on every major Rails version, and remembers the days when everyone implemented their own authentication system. When not developing, he enjoys picking up really heavy objects so that they can be put back down again.
