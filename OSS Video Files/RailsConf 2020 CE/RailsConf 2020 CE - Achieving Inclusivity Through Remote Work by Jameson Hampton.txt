Title: RailsConf 2020 CE - Achieving Inclusivity Through Remote Work by Jameson Hampton
Publication date: 2020-04-24

Description: 
	Achieving Inclusivity Through Remote Work by Jameson Hampton

"A strength of the tech industry is its ability to facilitate remote work. Remote work helps people — particularly people who are part of marginalized communities, such as folks who are undergoing a gender transition. We often talk about how to foster inclusive teams and remote work can be a big factor in that!

In this talk, you’ll learn about barriers that disproportionately affect underrepresented folks in tech, like health concerns, financial/geographical logistics and emotional burnout, as well as the ways working remotely can ease those burdens, and how to promote healthy distributed teams."

watch this video of my talk

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,340
it's called achieving inclusivity

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:23,599
through remote work and it's part of

00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:25,849
railsconf couch 2020 so thanks for

00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:27,529
inviting me into your living room it's

00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:30,439
very cozy like what you've done with the

00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:32,540
place and I hope that you're sitting on

00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:35,839
a very comfy couch wearing your comfiest

00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:37,910
pajamas as you watch this video I am

00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:42,470
wearing my pajamas as I am recording it

00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:44,659
for you so we just want to start out by

00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,879
briefly introducing myself my name is

00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:49,790
Jameson Hampton you can call me Jamie

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:52,610
I'm from Buffalo New York the home of

00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:54,710
bad sports I actually always start out

00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:57,739
my talks with that joke but right now

00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:00,739
there are no sports so actually we are

00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:02,809
all tied I would say at the moment I'm

00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:05,990
coming to you from Buffalo New York

00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:08,110
where I am currently in quarantine but

00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:10,340
doing reasonably okay

00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:12,229
I'm representing greater than code

00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,780
that's the podcast that I'm a panelist

00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:16,580
on if you haven't checked it out I

00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,320
recommend that you do I think it's a

00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,750
really good show we talked a lot about

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,880
tech but kind of through the lens of

00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,680
well who are the people behind the tech

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,650
and what's the story of their lives that

00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,440
kind of got them to that point I'm not

00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,940
representing a company right now and

00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,310
job-hunting during the pandemic is

00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,780
actually not that fun so if you are

00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:39,020
hiring and you might be interested in

00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,420
hiring a rails developer or a deaf role

00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,600
me on Twitter I'm at home and board the

00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,920
only thing I ask is if you talk about me

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,200
or my talk publicly which you're very

00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,760
welcome to do just keep in mind that I

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,760
use they/them pronouns Thanks

00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:12,380
so I'm gonna talk about remote work

00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:15,380
which is actually a topic that is very

00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:17,300
topical right now I would say this is

00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,610
some statistics that I'm starting out

00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:23,959
with from the Stack Overflow developers

00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:26,240
survey in 2019 asking people how often

00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:29,510
they work remotely so as you can see

00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:32,209
there is quite a big percentage in 2019

00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,489
that doesn't work remote at all although

00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:36,830
I would be interested to see the

00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:38,300
statistics for 2020 because I think

00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,950
they're gonna look a lot different now

00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,320
that pretty much everyone is working

00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,420
remote all of a sudden which I will talk

00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,390
about more later but as you can see here

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:49,730
even in 2019 about 12% of people

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:53,840
reported being full-time remote tech

00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:56,060
workers additionally in the 2017 stack

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,280
overflow developers survey they asked

00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:01,880
about priorities when looking for a new

00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,739
job and considering offers and 53% of

00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,989
people said that remote options were a

00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:07,190
top priority to them so obviously this

00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:08,390
is something that's important to people

00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:12,980
and something that people are thinking

00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:15,140
about so personally I've been working

00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,870
remote I've been working 80 to 100

00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,420
percent remote for my entire career

00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:22,700
about seven years and what I tell people

00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:26,660
this we usually have a conversation that

00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:28,459
goes a little bit like this I've had

00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,400
this conversation and variations of it

00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:32,810
many times and so I've many other people

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,900
that work remote which I know from

00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:37,940
working with many remote people and I've

00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,660
also found that these responses tend to

00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:43,100
annoy people that work full-time remote

00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,030
because I get that you know people who

00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,250
have never worked remote before

00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,900
sometimes will act like it's kind of a

00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,209
walk in the park or not like it's hard

00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,890
as a real job and it's not like that

00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:54,350
it's still a job you still have to get

00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:55,880
just as much done in fact I feel more

00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,650
guilty about taking breaks or whatever

00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,390
when I'm working from home than when I'm

00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,340
in an office because water-cooler chat

00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:03,799
kind of stuff like happens naturally in

00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,690
offices an additional you can be

00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:10,220
isolating not having that kind of chat

00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:12,230
throughout the day and this is a from an

00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,340
oatmeal article about it does like the

00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,950
pros and cons of

00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,510
it's pretty funny but this one kind of

00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:20,269
speaks to me like after I've been

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,320
working from home and not sometimes I

00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:24,919
won't get out of my house

00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:27,139
even before I was stuck in my house and

00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:28,580
so that kind of resonates with me and

00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:32,270
probably a lot of people that work

00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:34,070
remote but ultimately my response is

00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,860
usually something more like this like

00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:39,620
it's awesome I know right I'm wearing my

00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,870
PJs right now it rules I wish more

00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:45,020
people had the opportunity to do remote

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:47,479
work that one the last one is a bit of a

00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,880
monkey's paw I have to admit this is not

00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:52,750
the situation that I envisioned for

00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:56,720
everyone getting a chance to work remote

00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:58,760
but I do love working remote it really

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,030
works for me it's an awesome situation

00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,740
for me it helps me do my best work and a

00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,570
lot of people are in the same boat as me

00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:09,530
so I really want to talk about why that

00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:11,900
is and I think like a good place to

00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:14,600
start it's just the general benefits of

00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,580
remote work for anybody you're gonna see

00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,350
a lot of these things on any kind of

00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,080
article you read about remote work and

00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:24,080
like flexibility is a huge one for tons

00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,810
of people and remote jobs often have

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,039
more flexibility even on hours um you

00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,690
know maybe you want to start a little

00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:32,300
bit earlier a little bit later that's

00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:33,680
normally fine maybe you have things

00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,330
during the day you have to do at a

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,430
specific time like you have to pick up

00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:40,820
your kids from daycare it's easier to

00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:42,830
work around things like that obviously

00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,180
there's no commute this is a big one for

00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,650
a lot of people some people have a

00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,110
really long commute and this is a huge

00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,990
perk for me in Buffalo this is pretty

00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,729
big one for me also because a we don't

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:55,340
have public transportation really very

00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:57,229
well in Buffalo and B we have bad

00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,120
weather for a lot of the year so I don't

00:05:57,229 --> 00:06:03,139
have to dig my car out of the snow or

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:06,050
anything like that the freedom from to

00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:08,780
work from anywhere is pretty cool I used

00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,979
to do a lot of traveling when I can sure

00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,080
I will be doing it again at the point

00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:14,570
where I can doing a lot of conferences

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,389
going places visiting people visiting

00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:20,150
family I often visit my family in Texas

00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:22,729
and it was it's really nice to be able

00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:24,860
to work while I'm there in Texas instead

00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:29,770
of taking PTO I can work sharing the day

00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,770
and see my family in the evening Oh

00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,310
better productivity I think your mileage

00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,320
may vary a little bit with this one

00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,210
some people find it difficult to work

00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,150
from home and not get distracted by home

00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,320
things like the dishes in the laundry

00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,970
also right now this one's out the window

00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,260
nobody is having good productivity

00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,240
because of reasons

00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,470
pandemic reasons that I will talk a

00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,400
little bit more about later but in

00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:54,110
general for a lot of people they find

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,570
that they have better productivity

00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,820
working from home because you can have

00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:01,820
longer periods like uninterrupted

00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:05,750
focused time less interruptions from

00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:07,220
colleagues and such like this and I mean

00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,419
the comfort of working from a space that

00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,070
you're comfortable in can't be

00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:11,390
understated you do your best work when

00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:15,770
you're comfortable and you have a lot of

00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:17,750
control over your home office so

00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,919
obviously those were all benefits that

00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,140
list was kind of in general and for

00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:24,080
everybody and the word benefits is

00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:26,330
interesting this is a definition I read

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,010
a lot of definitions of it actually but

00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:30,260
I liked this one I liked promotes

00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:32,870
well-being as a phrase I think that's

00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:35,300
good the word advantageous or advantage

00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:38,000
came up in a lot of the definitions I

00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,320
read also but I think it can kind of

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,460
mean two different things which is what

00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,340
I get it when I say I think it's

00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,289
interesting some benefits are like perks

00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,969
they're nice to have they make your life

00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:48,590
a little bit better to have a little bit

00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:51,500
more flexibility to not have to do the

00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,969
commute but there's also people for whom

00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,370
remote work is more than just a little

00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:56,960
extra convenience and some benefits are

00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,360
things that you really need to make it

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,960
possible to do a job that would have

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,820
been very difficult otherwise so it's

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,099
it's cool to think about what benefits

00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:09,169
you want to give people but I think it's

00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:11,330
like more helpful or more important to

00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:13,370
think about like what problems or

00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:18,050
barriers people might be having that you

00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:20,360
could help solve using remote work and

00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:22,280
with that in mind I'm gonna talk for a

00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,500
couple of minutes about diversity and

00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,900
inclusion because what benefits are

00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,460
really valuable to people it's gonna be

00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,630
different for different people and it's

00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,140
gonna be different for different

00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:35,289
demographics too so why

00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,060
strive for a diverse team

00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:39,279
I think ultimately it's just the right

00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,750
thing to do um I think that's the

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,180
motivation for a lot of people which is

00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:46,540
great you know it's the right thing to

00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:49,570
do not to pass up people for a job

00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:51,130
because they look different from you but

00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,380
also in addition to that it makes your

00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:57,610
team stronger and that's like really

00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:58,779
true and in concrete ways first of all

00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,639
having different perspectives

00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:02,319
represented on your team makes you

00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,329
better at anticipating problems I

00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:06,819
actually do a whole talk about having

00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:08,170
how to have empathy for users that are

00:09:06,819 --> 00:09:10,389
from like a very different demographic

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,889
than you but it's tough we're not very

00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:13,120
great at anticipating the needs for

00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:15,310
people who have like different needs

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,569
than us so having lots of people on your

00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,610
team who have different needs from each

00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:21,670
other um like kind of spreads that out

00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:24,339
an interesting example that I like to

00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:26,069
tell the story of is a story about a

00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:28,509
team that was working on the early

00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:30,190
automated hand dryers like the ones

00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:33,310
where you put your hands under and it

00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,959
just turns on and they put this product

00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:39,459
out and it went out into like bathrooms

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:41,740
and they found then too late that it

00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:44,319
didn't really work well for black people

00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:47,319
because the their product wasn't very

00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:49,839
good at detecting black skin as opposed

00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:52,269
to white skin so obviously that was

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:55,120
embarrassing but I think the most

00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:57,250
embarrassing part about it is that like

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,839
they didn't think of it but it's also

00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,339
very indicative that they didn't have

00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:04,269
any black people working with their team

00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:07,180
because if there was a black person even

00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:08,500
one black person involved in any step of

00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,720
the process they would have super

00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,699
noticed that and they didn't notice it

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,019
so you can tell that they didn't have a

00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:19,060
diverse team and also you're just gonna

00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:20,880
lay on talented people maybe who are

00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:23,470
overlooked by other companies because

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,910
the tech industry kind has a diversity

00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,769
problem in general there's a lot of

00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,600
people hiring for culture fit just like

00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:30,430
hiring people that are just like

00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,470
everyone else on their team already and

00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,699
like not only does that make their team

00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,740
bad because they don't have these

00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,699
different perspectives but it also means

00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,290
that they're not getting the best

00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:39,550
candidates because they're only

00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,860
considering like a

00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:46,300
segment of the population so like you

00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:47,649
want to hire those candidates I also

00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,529
haven't talked real briefly about

00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:52,000
diversity versus inclusion this is a

00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:54,459
thing that a lot of people talk about in

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,690
tech I think which is good but diversity

00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:57,190
is kind of what I was talking about

00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,510
they're like having a team that does not

00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,940
look the same people from different

00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:02,800
backgrounds but inclusion is more than

00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,870
that it's making those people feel

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,019
comfortable welcomed and integrated on

00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:09,850
your team here's kind of a drawing I

00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:11,860
don't like the way the arrows are

00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:14,350
pointing in this drawing so ignore that

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:16,120
but on the left here you kind of have

00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,100
diversity like there's different people

00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,750
that aren't the same but they're kind of

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,519
segmented and they're not integrated

00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,019
with each other and then like on the

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,399
right it's more like inclusion because

00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:30,100
everyone's integrated into one team but

00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:32,019
diversity without inclusion actually

00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,820
alienates underrepresented people in

00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:35,680
your team it kind of indicates that you

00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,630
care more about having an about Us

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,630
section on your website that looks good

00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:42,250
with like diverse people on it then you

00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:44,170
care about actually supporting your

00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,610
employees and that will lead to less

00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,140
diversity over time because

00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:49,329
underrepresented people aren't going to

00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,370
want to stay at your company although

00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:52,930
the other hand inclusion feels diversity

00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,820
because then you are gonna retain those

00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:57,070
people and you're gonna attract even

00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,329
more diverse candidates because

00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,860
underrepresented people talk to each

00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:01,360
other and find out what companies are

00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:06,490
good at this and then go to work for

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:08,560
those companies so I want to talk about

00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:11,560
a few kind of different demographics of

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,390
people I can't cover all of them in fact

00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,459
I'm gonna talk about chronic illness and

00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,140
disability first and there are tons of

00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:19,149
different kinds of chronic illness and

00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,680
disability they have different symptoms

00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:23,589
different challenges different needs so

00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:26,410
this is pretty general but I am I do

00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:30,220
want to just close that I struggle with

00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:32,110
pretty severe anxiety disorder and I'm

00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,360
gonna talk about that it's a big part of

00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:36,370
why working from home is like pretty

00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,320
critical for me and has really improved

00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:43,000
my life so I'm gonna talk about my

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,370
perspective for that first of all lots

00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,480
of different people have different

00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:48,070
accessibility accommodations there's

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,270
like I said there's a lot of different

00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:52,250
types of disability

00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:54,200
and it's likely that the best

00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,690
accessibility that people are gonna find

00:12:54,200 --> 00:13:00,760
it's like at their own house where they

00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:03,020
can control all of those variables and

00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,090
like a lot of illness makes it hard to

00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:08,060
leave the house at all like some or even

00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:10,820
most of the time personally before I was

00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:14,300
fully remote I used to miss a ton of

00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:16,730
work because there were days when I feel

00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:19,040
too bad to like really get out of bed

00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,210
and I would have to call in it doesn't

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,780
actually mean that I can't work

00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:25,250
sometimes so actually I sometimes it's

00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,780
really helpful to be able to work

00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,660
because it takes my mind off whatever

00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:31,910
anxiety thing I'm going through so

00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,730
that's a huge advantage for me and

00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:36,530
related to that is that flexible working

00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,360
hours are a perk for anybody but some

00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:41,180
people really have a tangible need for

00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,280
them more for instance like there are

00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,020
days when I'll have a panic attack early

00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,840
in the morning which is really tough and

00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:49,580
I kind of just need to go back to bed

00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,800
for a couple of hours to be functional

00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:53,320
at all and so if I can start a little

00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,970
bit late and then work a little bit late

00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,070
that's like a whole day that I'm working

00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:01,840
that I would have had to call out

00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:04,550
otherwise which I used to have to do and

00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,170
also people who have a lot of doctors

00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:08,060
appointments need more flexibility for

00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:12,950
that and that's a big thing too for a

00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:14,990
lot of people when I talk about energy

00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:18,650
conservation I really like to use this

00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:19,970
metaphor of spoon theory I actually did

00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,650
an entire talk about spoon theory that

00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,660
I'll link at the end of this because I

00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:26,000
talk about a lot of really related stuff

00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:29,120
about some of these demographics but

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,250
spoon theory essentially is the idea

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,290
that everyone has a finite amount of

00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,340
energy that they can use in a day and so

00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,960
the spoons are kind of these

00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,960
metaphorical units of energy that you

00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,940
spend on doing things so people with

00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,920
chronic illness often have to really

00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,390
think about how much energy they're

00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,680
gonna have and what they can get done

00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:49,760
with that amount of energy and kind of

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:52,120
ration it and so getting to the office

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,950
you know getting up getting ready

00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,930
commuting getting to a building and like

00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:58,670
settling in can take a lot of energy for

00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,590
some people and so if you don't have to

00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:02,840
do any of those steps being able to

00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:08,570
start the day off like fresh with

00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:10,040
all of your spoons is like big and you

00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:12,680
know people want to keep their health

00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,030
issues private naturally lots of people

00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,030
who struggle with illness have like good

00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:18,860
days and bad days and maybe you just

00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:21,590
don't want people to see you on the bad

00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:24,170
days for me that means you know if I

00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:25,940
have a panic attack at home it sucks and

00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:27,950
it's rough for me but I'll get through

00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,600
it but if I have a panic attack at work

00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:31,130
it's really awful embarrassing for me

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,680
and it follows me around in a different

00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:35,030
way so just not having to turn on the

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,920
camera if you're having a bad day

00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:44,120
preserves like a lot of privacy for

00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:45,470
people I'm also gonna talk about the

00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,800
idea of being an underrepresented

00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:50,870
minority at your job again there's tons

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,300
of different kinds of ways that you

00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:55,070
could be underrepresented and I'm not

00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,270
gonna talk right now about specific ones

00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,860
but there are some things that I think

00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:01,010
anyone if they're not part of the

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:03,220
majority group kind of deals with an

00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,660
energy conservation is one of them again

00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:08,000
spoon theory was really designed to talk

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,500
about illness primarily but I do think

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,930
that underrepresented people have to use

00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:14,060
more energy at work for reasons like

00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:17,210
these ones code-switching

00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:19,850
it's basically the idea that the way you

00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:21,350
act and talk is different when you're

00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:24,050
with different kinds of groups of people

00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:26,390
and it takes mental energy to switch

00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:28,250
between them so we talk about bringing

00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:30,470
your whole self to work which is nice

00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,360
but actually most people really don't

00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,800
because naturally the way you talk to

00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,270
your coworker is just different than the

00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,430
way you talked like you're friends and

00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:39,370
that might be much more true if you're

00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:41,540
not part of like this majority in-group

00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,920
it might mean that like the sleighing

00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,300
you'd use with your friends who are in

00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,980
the same ethnic group as you is very

00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,290
different from how you talk from work

00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,210
for me I talk very different around a

00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,130
group of all queer people and we're open

00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,900
about certain things so there's an

00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:57,010
energy cost associated with like the

00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:59,060
mental calculations of that

00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:02,390
microaggressions are another thing that

00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:04,280
you could do a whole talk on but it's

00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:07,150
basically this idea that like small

00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:09,620
indirect often unintentional

00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:11,540
discriminations or comments against

00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,770
minority groups like happen in the

00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,680
office even if you're trying to avoid

00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,810
them it's just

00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,870
thing that happens this might be things

00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:22,560
like off-color jokes making assumptions

00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:23,790
about people for me an example that's

00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,820
really big it's like when I'm getting

00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:28,710
misgendered it's tiring for me and so

00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:32,880
these are small but they like add up and

00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:35,630
they take energy and it can make people

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,830
feel like an outsider in lots of ways

00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,780
someone once told me a story about

00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:41,430
working in a series of jobs where they

00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,890
were the only Latino and like any of

00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:45,090
their jobs and they always felt like

00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,790
none of their co-workers really

00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:49,290
understood them and then they worked at

00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,390
a place that was fully remote for the

00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:53,940
first time and had people all over the

00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:56,190
world and for the first time they were

00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,950
like oh I don't feel like I stick out

00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:00,810
because everyone on this team is

00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:04,980
different from each other and that was

00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:07,260
like a good feeling for them our

00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,840
resources can be an issue too again this

00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,580
could affect a lot of different kinds of

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,590
people but I think disproportionately

00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:16,140
underrepresented people who might come

00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:18,180
from like underprivileged backgrounds it

00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,620
can be really expensive to work um think

00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,510
about someone who just like did a boot

00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,830
camp they come from a privileged

00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:25,380
background and they're looking for their

00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:27,750
first tech job you know maybe they can't

00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:30,210
afford a nice wardrobe yet to dress

00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,680
business casual at an office maybe they

00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,000
can't afford to go out to lunch with

00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,460
their co-workers and it makes them feel

00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,800
left out maybe even like affording

00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,330
transportation to and from work can be

00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,720
an issue it's like and that's really

00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,980
stressful and difficult and it leads me

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,390
and so like the next thing I want to

00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,580
talk about too which is location-based

00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,110
diversity which i think is really

00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,300
important and sometimes overlooked when

00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:53,220
we have this discussion you know people

00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,170
who come from different places or live

00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,000
in different places or have different

00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:59,100
backgrounds or cultures have different

00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,840
perspectives as I said earlier that's

00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,210
gonna make your team better stronger

00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,950
more thoughtful and one of the big

00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,870
factors is that is that not everyone has

00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:10,470
the resources to live in major urban

00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:11,820
areas where a lot of tech jobs are maybe

00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,890
they can't afford it it's extremely

00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:16,920
expensive to live in New York City or

00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:20,250
San Francisco maybe they have family

00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,720
obligations people older people that

00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,250
they're taking care of and their family

00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,040
maybe they're from a culture where like

00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,060
being close to your families is really

00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,390
valued and they

00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:32,280
they don't feel like they can move away

00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:33,720
maybe they have visa issues if you want

00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,130
people from like different countries on

00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,680
your team I think that brings a ton of

00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:41,030
really good perspective but it can bring

00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:44,190
a whole kind of host of issues in itself

00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:45,480
and these also are just factors that may

00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:47,850
disproportionately affect

00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,220
underrepresented minorities a lot of

00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:51,750
people have underprivileged backgrounds

00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,910
different cultures being from different

00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:57,210
places different countries which is all

00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:59,400
cool I think it's really cool but it

00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:05,580
brings up a lot of these issues

00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:07,020
specifically I'm also gonna talk I want

00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,180
to kind of focus specifically on the

00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:11,460
trans community as like one segment of

00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,720
what I've just been talking about and

00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:17,040
the reasons that I kind of want to focus

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,990
on are I'm trans so talk about what you

00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,990
know and talk about what's important to

00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:23,100
you and this is really important to me I

00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,570
think the Train the number of trans

00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,940
people working in tech has been growing

00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:30,180
a lot and that means the likelihood that

00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:32,490
you are or you will be working with like

00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:34,860
a trans co-worker on your team is also

00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:37,460
growing a lot and so understanding that

00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:39,660
the perspective will help you work more

00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:43,290
effectively with your co-workers and

00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:45,030
respectfully actually also I believe

00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,680
that the reason that there's more trans

00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:48,480
people working in tech now is because

00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,400
remote work is a thing that's possible

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,380
in tech and remote jobs can be really

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,200
attractive for Trant to trans people for

00:20:52,380 --> 00:21:00,300
like unique reasons so what are those

00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:02,970
reasons transitioning is hard in general

00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:06,650
it's a huge change in one's life you

00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:10,140
know you're gonna have to completely

00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:13,560
replace your entire wardrobe likely many

00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:15,330
people do and periods of intense change

00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,770
are always very hard you have to worry

00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:18,600
about if people are gonna be respectful

00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:20,790
of you even if you're in a good

00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,410
situation where everyone is trying to be

00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,650
respectful of you which isn't always the

00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:25,320
case

00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,580
it could still be really hard and the

00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,140
Wardrobe was kind of the first one I was

00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,180
gonna talk about a lot of trans people

00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,050
have a lot of baggage about what kind of

00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,660
clothes they're gonna wear

00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:36,120
um and that can make navigating business

00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,230
casual very difficult if you have to

00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,420
replace your whole wardrobe when you

00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,050
first come out you know that's really

00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,460
tough

00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,900
and probably not a thing that happens

00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,640
all at once so you're replacing clothes

00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:47,130
over time and which means that newly out

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,380
trans people often like don't have a ton

00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:51,540
of clothes which can also make dressing

00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:55,740
like hard and stressful and there's just

00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:58,200
emotional baggage about it um same about

00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:00,660
using bathrooms it's really tough to

00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,790
explain how stressful it is to use

00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:05,640
bathrooms public bathrooms as a trans

00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:07,200
person I don't really have time to

00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,880
actually go into all the reasons for

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,560
that right now but I'm sure you have

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,210
kind of an idea you know you hear about

00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,460
like bathroom bills and stuff on the

00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:16,920
news so that's all you know related to

00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:21,480
that baggage I'm gonna link a talk at

00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:23,280
the end about specifically about how to

00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,590
support trans co-workers and it'll go

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,150
into that kind of stuff but basically

00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:28,920
please just let me use the

00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:31,290
gender-neutral bathroom in my own home

00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,890
that's the least stressful way to deal

00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,890
with this for me

00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,410
and like it makes you feel

00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,270
self-conscious about your appearance

00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:40,410
like being trans does that in general

00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,870
for a lot of people and like

00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:44,880
transitioning also like often comes with

00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:47,580
awkward teenage phases or it can feel

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,740
very uncomfortable to be seen especially

00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,480
if you're on hormones so it can be a

00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,770
relief to turn off your video on a day

00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,530
where you're feeling very self-conscious

00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:56,940
about that um some people you know also

00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:58,920
it's very important to them to keep

00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,530
their transition private and this helps

00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:03,150
keep it more private like there are some

00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:06,300
people I've been pretty open with my

00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:09,870
transition but some people like rightly

00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:11,280
just want to kind of go withdraw into a

00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:12,570
cocoon and then emerge when they're

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,680
feeling better about themselves which I

00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:18,030
totally get people have to learn your

00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:20,130
new name and pronouns and your first

00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:22,380
coming out and uh even well-meaning

00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:25,170
coworkers are gonna sometimes mess up

00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:27,270
especially at first it's I think it's

00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:29,640
easier to practice and get it right over

00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:31,170
like text based communication because

00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,850
then you can be like more thoughtful and

00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,390
catching yourself before you say their

00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:35,490
own thing

00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:37,530
for instance the company I used to work

00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:39,030
at everyone was really respectful and on

00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:41,160
slack everyone got my pronouns right

00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:42,960
like a hundred percent of the time but

00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:46,050
then when we had impure in-person meet

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,550
ups people would slip up and it was

00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,830
really tough for me because they were

00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:51,720
trying but it just like made me feel bad

00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,620
and I wanted to have a good time at

00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,280
these meetups and it

00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:58,680
harder additionally correcting people is

00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:01,050
like when they get it wrong can be very

00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:03,809
exciting to do saying it's much easier

00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:05,309
to do that over text subtly send someone

00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:09,960
a message than having to like speak up

00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:12,840
in person not all trans people have

00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,640
surgeries but many of us do I had

00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,220
surgery a couple of years ago and I was

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,840
worried about having enough sick time

00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,090
because they told me it was gonna be a

00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,559
pretty long recovery period but I ended

00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:25,170
up taking a lot less time off of work

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,270
than I thought because I was kind of

00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:29,340
bedridden but like I my mind was working

00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:31,380
and I could work right from my bed so

00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:33,600
that was really convenient and also

00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,160
people didn't have to like see me while

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:41,760
I was recovering which took a lot of

00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:43,950
stress off so we've talked a lot about

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,350
the benefits of remote work but there

00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:48,510
are cons of remote work too there are

00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:50,040
already a lot of articles and talks that

00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:52,320
kind of go into some of those challenges

00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:54,030
of remote work and give tips for working

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,370
effectively remote

00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:58,140
now there's the market is pretty much

00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,850
flooded with them since we've all been

00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,650
in this situation recently a lot of

00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:03,420
people that are already good at remote

00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:04,860
work want to like help support people

00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:07,350
that are brand-new to it which I think

00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:10,050
you know is cool and and nice of the

00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:12,330
community but actually the phrase

00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,920
already good at remote work it's kind of

00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:15,660
key to what I want to get into here

00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:19,020
which is that like there's this remote

00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:19,890
mindset that you have to get into it's

00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:23,250
not always easy

00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:25,770
it takes work remote work doesn't come

00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:28,140
naturally to any everyone it's a skill

00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:31,790
that takes practice and you can practice

00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:34,590
and get better at it like any skill and

00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:36,059
a healthy where remote environment

00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:37,950
doesn't just happen it's something that

00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:42,059
you have to be intentional about and

00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:44,240
create on purpose so let's talk about a

00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:46,710
few ways to do that

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,750
text-based communication for me is a

00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:50,940
really big one not all communications

00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:53,160
for remote workers is via text but

00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,410
naturally a lot of it is and text-based

00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,780
communication is very different than

00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:58,860
in-person communication so I'm going to

00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,720
talk about a bunch of things in the

00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,960
slide these are kind of tips that would

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,059
probably be helpful for anybody

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,900
but that will particularly help people

00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:10,250
like me who struggle with mental illness

00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:13,250
so here's some of the pros of text based

00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:16,940
communication you can go back and read

00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:20,120
messages again later one of my anxiety

00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:22,280
symptoms is memory lapses so it's really

00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,920
helpful to be able to go back and review

00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:27,530
exactly what people said later and then

00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:31,370
I remember it and the exact context

00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:32,720
India wants it also gives you more time

00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:34,250
to think about what you're gonna say you

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,020
know being put on the spot

00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:39,050
particularly if questions isn't

00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:41,390
anxiety-inducing also a sink culture

00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:42,920
helps with that even if someone needs an

00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:44,660
answer kind of like right now and not

00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,429
later it still gives you just a little

00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:48,020
bit more time to process and like to

00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:52,309
think about how I'm gonna word what I

00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:54,940
want to answer but here's some of the

00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:57,679
cons I guess of text based communication

00:26:54,940 --> 00:27:00,140
you know tone is really hard to convey

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,780
over text and my anxiety does make me

00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:04,880
worry a lot about tone and I read into

00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:08,809
people's words and like text-based

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,309
communication exacerbates that you have

00:27:08,809 --> 00:27:12,950
to be more explicit about your

00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:15,080
expectations I would say to err on the

00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:17,510
side of over communicating if you have

00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,820
to you know please tell me explicitly if

00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:21,800
your request is urgent or non urgent

00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:24,559
particularly if it's after work hours

00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:26,270
and like don't be afraid to just clarify

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,250
your tone even if that feels awkward

00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:30,559
like it sounds kind of silly but emojis

00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:33,350
help me a lot with this they can really

00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,690
kind of put some nuance in how to take

00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:37,730
what you've written

00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:40,850
we had an emoji and my old work slack I

00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:44,600
couldn't find the emoji but it was WIC

00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:47,450
which stands for when you can this was

00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,340
actually um something that my dad and I

00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:52,070
had come up with together I guess

00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:55,460
because he used to have a tendency of

00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:56,660
texting me and being like call me and I

00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:58,250
would get really nervous about that I

00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:00,230
feel like why do I have to call him what

00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:02,179
is this about you know what happened and

00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:04,309
I would get really really anxious and

00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:05,750
then I would call him and he would tell

00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:09,440
me like a funny story or something and

00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:12,950
so we developed when you can WIC is like

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,600
a text thing so that he could tell me

00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:16,880
basically express to me you know I want

00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,230
to talk to you but like now

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,299
that's something important just when you

00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,559
can and so we started using that at my

00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:24,649
old job and it was like helpful for

00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:26,929
everybody and with that in mind giving

00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:29,899
as much context as you can can really

00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:31,809
help to like if someone is like hey can

00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:34,519
you help on a call with me right now I

00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:36,620
it spikes my anxiety really bad you know

00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:38,029
what what happened what is it about is

00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:40,730
it urgent am I in trouble did something

00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:43,549
bad happen and I'll find like a thousand

00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:45,529
ways to read into that so you know it

00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:47,120
only takes a few seconds more to say

00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:49,250
something more like hey can you hop in a

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,200
call right now it's time-sensitive but

00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:53,870
not an emergency it's relating to this

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,970
certain project and that takes away all

00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:58,610
of that kind of anxiety so I can get on

00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:59,899
that call and be ready to talk about it

00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:06,980
and not freaking out about it

00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:09,259
I think the first step to being a good

00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:11,840
advocate is getting like a sense of the

00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:14,090
perspectives of other people so I think

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,279
that like listening to this talk is

00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:18,080
maybe a good first step but I do have

00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:20,269
some like actionable things I want to

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,970
talk about and one of them is this idea

00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:24,590
of like a remote first culture honestly

00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:26,179
I think remote works best when you have

00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:28,250
a whole team that's all remote but

00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:30,350
that's not always the case and it can't

00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:32,779
always be the case but you still can

00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:35,960
have this idea of like remote first and

00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:37,789
like prioritizing and valuing the fact

00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,740
that you have a remote team rather than

00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:41,409
being like you know oh I guess we can

00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:43,549
have a remote person for the right

00:29:41,409 --> 00:29:47,360
candidate or whatever which is kind of a

00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:49,100
warning sign because when some people

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,019
are remote and others aren't the remote

00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,929
people miss out on conversations that

00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:55,100
happen like naturally in person

00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:57,350
sometimes that just means like socially

00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:59,330
the remote person might not get to know

00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:01,730
their co-workers as well that's kind of

00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:03,320
hard to avoid but sometimes that means

00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:05,539
that they might get passed over for

00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,950
opportunities at work that's something

00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:10,159
that underrepresented people already

00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:11,690
have a hard time with sometimes they

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,639
might even people make it left out of

00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:15,139
conversations even relevant to projects

00:30:13,639 --> 00:30:17,029
that they're on cuz people just want to

00:30:15,139 --> 00:30:18,409
talk about it when they think of it and

00:30:17,029 --> 00:30:20,000
that makes it hard to do your best work

00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:21,740
and like be heard on your team which is

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,590
also something underrepresented people

00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:27,860
already struggle with and remote work

00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:32,820
can make it worse if it's done wrong

00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:35,370
so one thing that's really simple but

00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:37,860
really huge is just if you notice like a

00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:40,230
conversation happening that's excluding

00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:42,180
someone who's remote just say something

00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,830
you know oh you know what we should

00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:45,440
probably include Jamie on this cuz

00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:47,880
they're working on this project too

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,290
let's put a pin on this and come back to

00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,510
it when Jamie can be part of the

00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:54,990
conversation that kinda thing goes a

00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:56,820
long way this one might be like a pet

00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:58,980
peeve of mine specifically but I'm sure

00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:02,040
that this bothers other people too but I

00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:03,720
hate being on video calls where there's

00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,970
like a bunch of people who are together

00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,500
in a room and they have one video for

00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:09,990
that and then like there's a couple of

00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,610
remote people that called in it is

00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:13,830
impossible to keep up with the

00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:16,890
conversation in that room there's lag

00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:20,070
there's noise I can't make speak up and

00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:22,530
be heard it makes me feel so left out

00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:24,150
it makes me feel more left out than just

00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:27,030
like not being included in the

00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:29,070
conversation at all so at my last

00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:30,810
company we talked about this and we

00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:33,420
decided that like everyone should phone

00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:34,740
into video calls individually so people

00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,690
who are in the office even though

00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,980
they're in the same room all like took

00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:39,810
out their laptops put on their

00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:42,210
headphones and call it in individually

00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:43,740
and that made it feel even though they

00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:46,020
weren't remote it made it feel more like

00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,880
a remote call and meeting and like put

00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:55,020
everyone on the same playing grip like

00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:56,310
level playing ground I guess like I said

00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,890
it's not possible to cover all

00:31:56,310 --> 00:32:00,690
microaggressions that you might see but

00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:02,280
just in general a really good way to

00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:05,220
support underrepresented people in an

00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:09,270
office is to identify microaggressions

00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:11,630
so that a you cannot do them and B you

00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:14,160
can stop other people when they do them

00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:16,560
so again I'm just gonna talk about a

00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,730
couple here that were relevant to some

00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:22,230
of the specific things I've already

00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:24,750
touched on please don't comment on

00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:26,160
people's appearance on video calls I'm

00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:28,470
not talking about like you know oh I

00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,970
like your new haircut but people will

00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:31,670
sometimes say stuff like oh you look

00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:34,080
under the weather

00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:35,940
please don't if someone looks under the

00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,650
weather maybe they look tired maybe

00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:39,630
they've going through some awkward acne

00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,900
maybe they're just shoveled and wearing

00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:42,270
out there

00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:45,570
pajamas please just don't say anything

00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:47,100
it's easy and it costs $0 to not say

00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:50,460
anything and it will make people

00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:52,650
uncomfortable if you do oh and related

00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:55,470
to that allow people to keep their video

00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:56,940
off sometimes a lot of places push for

00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:59,010
everyone having video on during calls

00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:02,840
and I get that I think there's value to

00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:04,770
that it really does foster more of a

00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,750
relationship between co-workers I've

00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:09,060
done this both ways an audio-only just

00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:10,530
doesn't kind of make you feel like

00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:12,720
you're a team and friends the same way

00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:15,230
um but if someone has to keep their

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,700
video off like occasionally or sometimes

00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:21,120
there's probably a reason that they're

00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,860
doing that so I would try to just let

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:27,390
that happen and not make people feel

00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:27,780
weird about it this is a really big one

00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:30,390
for me

00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:32,760
um correct pronouns and correct name are

00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:35,160
not is not something that you should

00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:37,350
just do when you're with somebody you

00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,700
should be doing that all the time and

00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:41,760
especially if there are people in person

00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:44,010
in office and then a trans worker is

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:47,880
remote like this is how I've experienced

00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:50,010
I like get a lot of anxiety wondering if

00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:53,220
I'm being misgendered in the office

00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:56,940
where I can't hear it I'm what I'm not

00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:58,580
there and so I worry about that and I've

00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,450
even talked to my co-workers about that

00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:02,910
so don't let that happen

00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:04,950
you know it's disrespectful and it's

00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:06,630
also bad practice for when you are with

00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,740
that person and then you're gonna mess

00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:11,429
up in front of them and make them feel

00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:13,649
even worse the caveat with this is I

00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:16,169
would talk to someone about doing this

00:34:13,649 --> 00:34:18,360
some people are uncomfortable with the

00:34:16,169 --> 00:34:20,940
idea of other people correcting people

00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:24,770
on their pronouns and such I think most

00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,770
people would appreciate this

00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:32,720
okay so I would be remiss if I didn't

00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,100
talk about working remotely in the

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:38,510
situation that we're in right now

00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:39,860
directly I wrote this proposal and got

00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:43,580
it accepted rails comp and started

00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:46,910
writing this talk quite a few months ago

00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:49,550
before I or the general public I think

00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:51,470
we're really aware of Kovan 19 and did

00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:54,200
not have any idea what kind of situation

00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:56,179
where you're gonna be in but it's kind

00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,970
of a big thing now a lot of people are

00:34:56,179 --> 00:35:00,920
working from home for the first time and

00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:03,560
to those people I say welcome to the

00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:05,600
club please let us help you please let

00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:08,000
us give you tips a lot of people want to

00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,260
do that as I mentioned earlier um but I

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,510
think in some ways actually this is a

00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:14,180
pretty huge revolution there have been a

00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:15,800
lot of people advocating for remote work

00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,780
talking about all the reasons that

00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,730
remote work would help them like I've

00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,720
been talking about and a lot of people

00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:22,730
those companies are just like no you

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,920
know we can't we can't support remote

00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:28,670
work we're not gonna do it and I think

00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:32,330
that we obviously can we're seeing now

00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:34,010
it's hard but we can and I think this is

00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:37,280
a bit of a Pandora's box situation

00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:39,320
because even though this is a tough

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,540
situation that we're in right now I

00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,730
think it's gonna be really hard after

00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:46,490
it's done to tell some of those people

00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:50,120
who'd been wanting remote accommodations

00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:51,170
like no we're going back so we can I

00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,760
think it's gonna be hard to put that

00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:56,180
back in the box so we're kind of in a

00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,290
new world now um but the other hand you

00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,910
have a lot of people who are working

00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:00,140
from home for the first time and saying

00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:02,090
like this sucks

00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:06,560
and you know what you're right it

00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:08,960
totally sucks the becoming remote only

00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:11,690
in the middle of this corporate 19 thing

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,340
is like not a healthy remote environment

00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:15,530
like I was talking about earlier like it

00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:17,690
has to be intentional you have to work

00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:19,670
at it and we were all kind of just

00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:23,000
thrown into this and there's tons of

00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:25,190
factors you're not normally under the

00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,710
stress of living in this world in a

00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:29,870
pandemic you're not normally stuck in

00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:32,090
your house all the time maybe with like

00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:33,710
your spouse who also can't go to work or

00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:37,190
your kids who can't go to school and

00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:39,020
everyone is distracting you this isn't

00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:41,150
what remote work is normally

00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:43,100
and I want to assure everyone of that

00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:46,100
because I'm hoping that we can push

00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:47,660
towards remote work long-term but like I

00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,670
don't want to see a whole bunch of

00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:52,190
people being like nope I tried it and it

00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:55,820
was awful this is not countless trying

00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:56,870
it it can be so much better than this

00:36:55,820 --> 00:37:01,100
when you're doing it in the right

00:36:56,870 --> 00:37:02,690
situation and like it makes me think

00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:06,080
about the future um

00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:08,810
like how is this gonna look after maybe

00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,280
some of the situations iced down um it's

00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:12,320
really hard to speculate about the

00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,720
future right now since gosh dang it we

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,450
just have no idea what the world is

00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,670
gonna be like in a few months

00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:23,090
um but I do think that while we're in a

00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:25,790
tough situation right now we have the

00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:28,490
power I guess to let it change the

00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:30,890
landscape in ways that are exciting and

00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:33,650
that will help a lot of people long-term

00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:35,390
by integrating remote work as a more

00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:37,940
standard part of our lives and

00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:39,860
ultimately I think if we can find a

00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:42,350
silver lining and use some of this bad

00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:45,980
situation to make people's lives better

00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:49,550
in the future we it's our responsibility

00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:52,090
to do that and I'm hopeful that we will

00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:52,090
be able to

00:37:54,690 --> 00:38:00,900
I did say that I would recommend a few

00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:03,810
videos understanding spoon theory and

00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:06,060
preventing burnout is a talk of my own

00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:08,880
from railsconf 2017 it was my first

00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:14,430
rails talk talk actually it's pretty

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:15,960
personal also but I hope that you could

00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:17,700
get something out of it

00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,040
things that I wish I knew before going

00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:23,849
remote remote that's a talk from

00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:25,560
railsconf 2019 by Marla's oisin like I

00:38:23,849 --> 00:38:29,520
said there's a lot of talks this is a

00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:32,579
pretty pretty well trod topic but I

00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:35,579
liked this talk so I'm recommending it

00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:38,490
and then trans I for the sis Ally also

00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:42,180
from railsconf 2019 Julian Fitzpatrick

00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:45,300
did this talk about ways to be a good

00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:46,589
co-worker and advocate for trans people

00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,410
that you might work with really

00:38:46,589 --> 00:38:51,210
informative and helpful talk and Julian

00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:53,310
was also my track organizer for

00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:56,069
railsconf this year this talk was

00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:58,520
supposed to be part of Julian's soft

00:38:56,069 --> 00:39:01,349
skills track which was really exciting

00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:02,880
so I want to shout out to them and I

00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:05,040
hope that maybe some of the other people

00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,720
from our track also put out their videos

00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,210
because it looked like some really good

00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:17,130
talks so maybe you can emulate this

00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:19,650
track experience at home but seriously

00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:21,869
thank you so much for taking the time to

00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:24,540
listen to this it makes me feel

00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:26,880
connected to the rails community that we

00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:29,130
are still able to kind of put this on as

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:33,060
best we can and put out content while

00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:35,520
we're in quarantine you can find me on

00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:38,670
Twitter at Jamie - Jamie - comm is my

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,710
website has my email on there normally

00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:42,780
when I do a talk live I get a lot of

00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:44,730
feedback from people and I'm not really

00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,470
getting that and that means a lot to me

00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:49,020
so actually it would really I would

00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:50,369
really appreciate it if you like this

00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:53,880

00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:03,960
a lot to me to get some feedback from

00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:06,930
you in that way but other than that

00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,549
stay safe stay healthy the rails

00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:10,829
