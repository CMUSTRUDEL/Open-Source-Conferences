Description: 
	Static Type Checking in Rails with Sorbet by Hung Harry Doan

"Sorbet is a powerful static type-checking tool for Ruby. Type checking can catch errors early and improve the developer experience—and with the right tools, it can even be used with dynamic methods in Rails.

In this talk, we’ll cover the basics of type checking and share the lessons learned from our adoption of Sorbet type checking across our 2,500-file codebase in just six months. We’ll talk about the technical challenges we faced and how we solved them with a new Sorbet-Rails gem, which makes it easy to gradually integrate type checking into your Rails app & improve your team’s efficiency."
