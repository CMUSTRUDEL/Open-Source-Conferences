Description: 
	Deeper Understanding & Better Communication through Art by Anna Rankin

"Understanding new concepts and complex systems is hard. Explaining them? That’s even harder.
Like anyone in a highly specialized career, software engineers may struggle to convey information concisely, confidently, and clearly to their technical and non-technical teammates. As a former illustrator and graphic designer, has found that visual art can be the key to both deeper understanding and clearer, more accessible communication. In this talk, we’ll explore why the ability to clearly communicate is so vital to mastering a complex topic, how to choose the right abstractions to present to a specific audience, and how a different medium can provide a new lens through which to view a familiar topic."

__________

As a tech lead, Anna spends her days at General Assembly helping a team of engineers deliver reliable, useful software that helps adults learn the skills they need to pursue a career that inspires them. Before transitioning to software, she was an undercover tech enthusiast working in roles ranging from graphic designer to ESL tutor — and even community relations for a small island! In her free time, she makes pixel art, designs punny stickers, and hangs out in dog parks with her pup.

hello and welcome to my railsconf couch

00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,940
talk today I want to talk to you about

00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,440
what it means to build understanding and

00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,630
improve communication through a visual

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,000
art if you want to get in touch with me

00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:26,260
my twitter handle is at the bottom of

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,880
this slide and the next introduction to

00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,220
me my name is Anna Rankin

00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,230
I am the tech lead on the EdTech team at

00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,449
the education company General Assembly I

00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:35,949
work with some excellent humans on the

00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:38,830
software that powers our in-house

00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:41,080
student and administrator tools before

00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:43,780
that I was a web development instructor

00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,460
at the same company I have a BFA in

00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,680
illustration from the School of Visual

00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:51,729
Arts I create a lot of pixel art

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,339
stickers and really great puns in

00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:56,890
addition to my sticker problem and my

00:00:54,339 --> 00:00:58,870
pixel art addiction I like to push the

00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:01,120
limit of the custom emoji as art form

00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,379
and slack although honestly since I live

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,449
in New York City and the time of

00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:06,549
quarantine it's been a lot more animal

00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:10,930
crossing than productivity and that's

00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:12,850
okay today we're going to talk about how

00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,860
you as a technologist can use the

00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,500
creation and dissemination of visual art

00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,790
to train yourself train others and get

00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,690
in touch with the depths of your own

00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:24,340
knowledge on a given subject a little

00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,590
bit about me and why I care about this

00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,330
stuff so I don't have a CS degree I

00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,280
never considered myself to be very good

00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,620
at math I spent a lot more of my time

00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,880
drawing dogs than making websites so as

00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,160
a person from a non-traditional

00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,930
background who's now working in a very

00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,220
technical field with a lot of topics

00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,640
that aren't familiar to the general

00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,140
public

00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,690
I've been able to use my artistic

00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,470
abilities to my advantage this didn't

00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,150
come immediately

00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,860
but I found that I could communicate my

00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,420
ideas better with my teammates when I

00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:52,780
drew them out on a whiteboard or a scrap

00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,520
of paper it was helpful to be able to

00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,200
sketch out what I was thinking and see

00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,870
how my co-workers thoughts fit into mine

00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:02,250
visually as an added bonus gaps in my

00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:04,480
knowledge became clear very very quickly

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,310
as I becomes take a larger role in

00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,140
designing architecture and mentoring

00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,300
other people s ability to represent

00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:12,489
complex topics in a simplified way has

00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,290
helped me a whole lot I tend to use

00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:15,430
visual tools every step of the way

00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,290
whether I'm working with a staff

00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:20,799
engineer a summer intern or just

00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:22,689
brainstorming on my own what it all

00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:23,140
comes down to is using different lenses

00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:25,090
or

00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,530
different ways of thinking to examine

00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:29,020
what you know and build the

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,490
understanding of people around you there

00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:33,280
are two specific problems I'm going to

00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:35,709
tackle today One is using drawing as a

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,620
way to clarify what you don't know and

00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:42,940
two as a way to help explain the things

00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:45,100
that you do know the main reason I

00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,540
became a developer on a product team was

00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,380
in order to solve problems for people

00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,540
that I cared about

00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,250
in this case teachers and students on a

00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,560
larger scale than I could without

00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,760
software a lot of other important

00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,290
considerations go into becoming

00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,760
developer but if you're not delivering

00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,050
something of value that people are

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,930
actually going to use what's the point

00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,340
of the effort if we want to solve

00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,230
anything for anyone we first need to

00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,300
understand the problem at hand and the

00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,950
tools that we can use to solve it and

00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,720
where we understand about the ecosystem

00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,310
that we operate within the more informed

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:17,350
or decisions and overall approach the

00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:18,730
problem will be this quest for deeper

00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,709
understanding is something that we have

00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,810
in common with artists we're both in

00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:24,220
pursuer of or both in pursuit of a

00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,970
higher understanding of the world around

00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:30,280
us or of some deeper philosophical truth

00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:31,480
but wait you say I can't even draw this

00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,030
has nothing to do with me

00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,620
I say you're wrong everything that you

00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,320
can do now everything that you're an

00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,299
expert in and you do have expertise you

00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,190
once had to start from zero with so

00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:44,110
please don't let inexperience or a lack

00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,150
of formal schooling stop you from

00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,340
experimenting with new skills and new

00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,540
ways of seeing if I had done that I

00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:53,620
would probably still be a graphic

00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:55,600
designer and be miserable let's jump

00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,579
right into building understanding we're

00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,620
gonna use drawing as both a learning and

00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:04,150
a diagnostic tool for our own knowledge

00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:06,010
stored in our brains the drawing process

00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,530
is a lot like the development process in

00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,000
a lot of ways there are skills and

00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,950
techniques that are taught formally in

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,750
art school that can be exceedingly

00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,880
helpful during the learning process I'm

00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,650
gonna introduce a few tools from the

00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,090
illustrators toolbox to help you work

00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:23,080
through technical problems and teach

00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:24,850
others drawing from observation for

00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,520
example is a key tool in any artists

00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,600
toolbox this is important because before

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,010
you can solve a problem or learn

00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,080
something new you've got to know your

00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:36,039
goal how do we even figure out where to

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,969
start by looking drawing from

00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:38,829
observation a

00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:40,809
you to practice hand-eye brain

00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:42,759
coordination you can sketch out

00:04:40,809 --> 00:04:44,769
unfamiliar features of a subject that's

00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:46,629
already familiar to you and basically

00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:48,849
put things in context to the general

00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:50,799
idea that's already in your head without

00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:52,659
first carefully observing source

00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:54,279
material that you want to understand you

00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,899
can only hope to depict an object or a

00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:57,699
concept based on what's already in your

00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:59,049
head if you're learning something new

00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:01,119
that's not what you want you want to

00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:02,709
bring in new information elaborate on

00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:04,599
what you already know and put that

00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:08,709
additional information into context in

00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:09,699
your brain when it comes to software

00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:11,769
this might mean keeping the

00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:13,449
documentation your application the

00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:15,219
codebase or other artifacts open while

00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:17,349
you draw or write out your ideas or take

00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:19,569
notes you're just gonna try and confirm

00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:22,989
that what's in your head matches up with

00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:25,299
what's in reality for example say you

00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:27,039
had a question how do I add a new route

00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:29,439
to this rails app that hits a given

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,959
controller the first place that I would

00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,939
start to look for that would be at the

00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:35,349
documentation the rails caves are

00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:38,769
actually fantastic and they're how I

00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:40,119
learned that I use rails once you look

00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:42,159
at the documentation though you're gonna

00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:43,689
start noticing new questions pop up you

00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:45,519
solve one problem and another one comes

00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:47,499
up and that's progress so why aren't

00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,969
these parameters coming through what if

00:05:47,499 --> 00:05:50,439
this route is nested does that change

00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:53,769
the controller it goes to what's going

00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:55,809
on here so you're gonna come up with new

00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:58,539
questions you can dig further deeper

00:05:55,809 --> 00:06:01,749
into the documentation I also love using

00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:03,069
pry as a playground so just throw a

00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:05,769
binding net price somewhere in your code

00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:08,379
play around with things see how things

00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:11,669
work and then record your findings so

00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:11,669
that you have it to look back on later

00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:15,939
once you've identified what it is that

00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:18,279
you're trying to learn or understand

00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:20,259
it's time for the sketching phase you're

00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:21,909
translating what's in your head onto a

00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:23,079
piece of paper which is a weird and

00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:25,779
difficult process if you've never done

00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:27,339
it before for an artist this is where a

00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:30,399
rough draft of the final composition

00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:32,019
comes together so sketches though are

00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,119
ephemeral they're meant to be destroyed

00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:36,729
or thrown away so now is not the time to

00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:41,199
worry about accuracy think of it as a

00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:42,789
rough draft of what's in your head this

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,259
is the stage where your brain digests

00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:45,669
all of the scattered little bits of

00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:47,860
information that you've given it and

00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:50,380
begin to synthesize it into a cohesive

00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,580
whole getting it all out on paper

00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,410
raise up some working memory in your

00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,880
brain and it allows you to examine your

00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,650
knowledge without having to keep it all

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,440
in mind at once just don't have enough

00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,700
room it's not possible this picture

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,710
shows how knowledge of different

00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,630
individual features can be combined to

00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:07,780
paint a fuller more complete portrait of

00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:09,820
a human being each individual feature is

00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,560
important to understand but it's the

00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:14,050
relation of the features to each other

00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:20,710
that makes us a recognizable accurate

00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:23,110
portrait I found this awesome study from

00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:26,140
1996 that talks about drawing as a means

00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,370
to have a conversation with paper the

00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:30,070
same way that you represent with your

00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:32,680
co-workers you can also use a drawing as

00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:34,960
a sounding board I like this quote a lot

00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,140
sketching on paper and pencil supports

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,540
ambiguity imprecision and incremental

00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:43,180
formalization of ideas as well as rapid

00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,890
exploration of alternatives what this

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,720
means to me is that drawing out a new

00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,880
idea can help you formulate an approach

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,180
by encouraging experimentation and

00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,620
iteration on an idea with code you have

00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,630
to know exactly what to tell the

00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,240
computer in order to get your idea you

00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:00,040
know working with a drawing you can be a

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,510
lot more hand-wavy and that gives you a

00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:06,010
lot more flexibility in what you're

00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:08,020
doing this concept was also referred to

00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:10,420
in the paper as thinking with a pencil I

00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:13,000
really liked this thought by drawing and

00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:15,070
looking designers find visual analogies

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,360
they remember relevant examples that are

00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:18,910
related to what they're working on and

00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,430
they discover entirely new shapes based

00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:23,860
on unrecognized geometric configurations

00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,780
in their sketches I find that absolutely

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,400
fascinating your brain links different

00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,470
ideas and experiences together in a lot

00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,330
of ways and putting that down all on

00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:34,360
paper allows you to take a look and draw

00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:38,320
parallels to prior knowledge it's really

00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,300
really helpful once you've got an

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,310
outline of what you know laid out on

00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:45,670
paper in front of you it's time for a

00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:48,100
critique and refinement you can erase

00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:50,170
some parts at others maybe propose

00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,510
different configurations solicit

00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:54,130
feedback you can keep this drawing in

00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:56,190
your head as a mental model of how

00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,480
things work and refer back to it later

00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,490
added bonus as long as you have this

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,230
high level idea of what's going on you

00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,030
can keep adding to it you can keep it up

00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,500
to date and you have a strong model that

00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:09,720
you can use to contextualise new

00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:11,650
information as it comes in pretty cool

00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,480
while you're doing all this it's

00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:15,400
important to remember that the end

00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,780
result is not nearly as important as the

00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,850
process you're going through to get

00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:23,290
there this is not the time to be

00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:25,270
precious with your work story time when

00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,800
I was NART school one drawing class in

00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:29,110
particular was infamous for how it was

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,850
taught it was an observational drawing

00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:33,880
class that ran for three months

00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,710
six hours a week each session students

00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,480
would spend hours working on a single

00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:40,090
drawing of the same model in the same

00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,560
setting position and lighting after a

00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:43,150
final critique of their work the

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,070
instructor issued a cruel sounding

00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:48,270
instruction take that drawing you've

00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:50,620
created and erase the entire page as

00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:52,450
message the students was you've done it

00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:55,180
once and now you can do it again you

00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:56,980
know how this approach may have been a

00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,770
little heavy-handed but it definitely

00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,060
drove the point home the most valuable

00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:03,880
thing that you wind up with in the end

00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:06,310
is your improved skill not a single

00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:11,230
drawing or a painting so don't be

00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:13,240
precious with your artwork once we've

00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:15,130
built this understanding up and we have

00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,170
a strong proposal or mental model and

00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:19,330
have a goal in mind it's time to share

00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:20,800
it with others I'm going to talk about

00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:23,020
different formats and types of

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,060
illustration where best to use those and

00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:30,250
share some tips for creating clear and

00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:32,320
compelling imagery so this here is an

00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,910
excerpt from Wikipedia's article on the

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,380
publisher subscriber pattern that I

00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:37,930
found when I was looking up how it

00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,430
worked if you're anything like me your

00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,110
reaction to a wall of text that

00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:45,400
describes an unfamiliar topic is

00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:46,690
something like this and so I had a ton

00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,790
of information in front of me without

00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:49,630
context though I had very little

00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:54,400
understanding

00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:56,770
I found this diagram in real-time api's

00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,120
documentation so props to them any

00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:00,190
different parts of the system it

00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,720
described a lot clearer to me like I see

00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,710
the publisher I see the chalice and the

00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,380
message is going through to the

00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:06,670
subscribers it seems so simple when you

00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,070
look at it here means it's a good

00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:10,930
illustration this gave me a really nice

00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:12,340
high level shortcut to keep in mind and

00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:17,470
refer back to while I got deeper into

00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:18,970
the documentation spring goes to

00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:21,340
keeping your goal in mind when you're

00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:23,050
creating illustrations is this something

00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:25,270
that's gonna be put in an architecture

00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,410
proposal is this an illustration of a

00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:28,660
problem that you want to show to your

00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:30,820
team is this gonna be accompanying a

00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:34,000
blog post are you creating documentation

00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:35,680
for your team or for end-users the

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,780
function of your visual aid will heavily

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,390
affect the forum and the content so it's

00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:43,420
helpful to nail this down in advance

00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:45,660
illustrators do this all the time let's

00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:48,340
really quick define what illustration is

00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,320
so in general and illustrators goal is

00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:53,650
to bring illumination to what is obscure

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,300
to clarify or enlighten it could be an

00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:57,640
example that helps make something clear

00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:00,400
or a picture or a diagram that makes

00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,620
something clear or attractive Thank You

00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,600
merriam-webster even within this

00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,640
definition though there's an entire

00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:10,660
world of variation depending on what the

00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:13,420
artist wants to communicate I wanted to

00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,770
use you koshimizu editorial work as an

00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,890
example of a strong conceptual

00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:20,110
illustrator rather than depict processes

00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:21,220
or create portraits she tackles the much

00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:24,370
more elusive job of illustrating

00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:27,690
concepts these images depict online

00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:32,170
shaming dusting off the male gaze and

00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:33,760
tolerance intern Yoko was an instructor

00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,560
of mine when I was in school and she is

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,510
a wonderful human if you're interested

00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,370
in the process behind these images she

00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:42,010
has a really great sort of step-by-step

00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:44,460
on her website so highly recommend

00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,460
checking that out

00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:49,780
another artist I love is Andy rash I

00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:51,040
love his pixel art portraits he's a

00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,570
large part of what inspired me to

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,600
actually get back into pixel art and

00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:58,540
create it again this is an example of

00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,400
taking minimalism to an extreme without

00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,560
losing the gist of what you're turning

00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,110
it across in this case he's showing a

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,700
likeness the portrait he's able to

00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,590
create a recognizable image of a

00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,900
celebrity using the least amount of

00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:16,030
detail possible that's hard to do and

00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:17,980
very impressive speaking of impressive

00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:19,990
Ernst Haeckel was a German zoologist

00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,760
that an artist among many many other

00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:24,010
things very very much a Renaissance dude

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,500
who discovered described and named

00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:28,560
thousands of new species his work is a

00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,820
good example of scientific illustration

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,310
these drawings are precise in a way

00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,620
photo

00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:36,380
can't be they highlight the important

00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,750
features proportions shapes and textures

00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,490
of the creatures he was depicting while

00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,890
leaving things like irrelevant latent

00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:45,110
shading backgrounds and related to Bri

00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:48,140
out of it it's also beautifully done

00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:53,180
he's exacting and detailed just as you'd

00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:55,040
expect a scientist to be in software

00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,260
conceptual illustration is still

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,880
extremely useful

00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:01,310
Maggie Appleton is an art director and

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,350
the lead illustrator at egghead IO she

00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:05,480
creates fantastic visual analogies

00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:07,910
ranging from like simple concepts to

00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,470
extremely complex ones highly highly

00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:12,320
recommend checking out her website for

00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:14,210
more very good examples illustrations

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,190
like this are especially useful for

00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:18,950
beginners but they're still awesome for

00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:20,870
advanced audiences it's great if you can

00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:22,820
meet your audience on familiar ground to

00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:27,680
lessen the barrier to entry for your

00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:29,529
explanation analogies are wonderful in

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,300
general for communicating understanding

00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:34,550
so these two pictures are examples of

00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,020
visual analogies that I came up with to

00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:38,089
answer the question what's the

00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:41,270
difference between two identical objects

00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:42,890
in JavaScript and Ruby the first is a

00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:45,560
more general illustration that frames

00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:49,070
the question one should be equal to your

00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:52,160
clone are you the same person do you

00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:54,740
have all the same attributes the second

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,570
one is more specific and it shows the

00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,850
philosophical differences between how

00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:02,000
Ruby and JavaScript treat data structure

00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:03,470
quality the second one is a shortcut to

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,750
a mental model that I have in my own

00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,940
head that I wanted to share JavaScript

00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,650
equality works on identity so is this

00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,140
the same box no it's not the same box

00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:13,940
it's not equal ruby looks at the

00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,430
attributes of an object looks at these

00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,770
two boxes same stuff in this box yeah

00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:22,910
they're equal so just a philosophical

00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:24,800
difference this example gets a little

00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,780
closer to the scientific illustration

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,279
side of things it's an example of a

00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,260
diagram that I created to show how our

00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:34,010
system would integrate with an external

00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:36,290
system so this external system routes

00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:39,440
the users to a show page for a given

00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:42,350
thing with a specified ID along with a

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,209
secret our server checks to see if the

00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,200
thing exists and if the secret token

00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:47,329
provided his vow

00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:50,029
if both those checks succeed we display

00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:51,019
the thing if they don't we 404 and we

00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:53,360
don't even tell them that there was a

00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:55,190
thing to begin with obviously some

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,050
details have been changed but a simple

00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,610
illustration like this is a great entry

00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,899
point for keeping the overall flow in

00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:04,070
someone's mind as they read your

00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:05,269
proposal for the purposes of this talk

00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:07,579
I'm going to encourage you to think like

00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:09,680
a scientific illustrator someone who

00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:12,890
brings clarity and simplicity to the way

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:16,339
that complex things work be the hakko

00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:19,610
you want to see in the world that brings

00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:20,839
us to what makes a good illustration so

00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,709
I'm going to share a couple of tips for

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,940
accessible effective illustrations

00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:27,110
before you can draw out an illustration

00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,690
you've got to know where your audience

00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:31,310
is starting from if you're teaching for

00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,839
example you should know the experience

00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:34,279
level of your students and their

00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:36,620
familiarity with the topic that you're

00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:38,839
addressing for example are you teaching

00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,579
a brand new cohort of people who have

00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:42,500
never touched programming before in

00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:44,180
their lives are you teaching Ruby to

00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,160
someone who already knows JavaScript how

00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:52,279
can you tie in to what they already know

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:53,750
to give them some new knowledge one way

00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:56,390
you can do that is to use familiar

00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,949
symbols and language so when presenting

00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,870
a new or complex topic the best way to

00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:02,000
lower the barrier to entry is to make it

00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:04,000
easier for your learner to kind of lean

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,439
on the knowledge that they already have

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,209
one reason learning to code is so

00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:10,280
difficult not only are you having a ton

00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:11,959
of new concepts thrown at you you're

00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,329
also expected to learn the syntax of a

00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:16,309
new language at the same time using

00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:18,829
familiarity to make this a little less

00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:20,959
intimidating and add some clarity is a

00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:23,000
lot way to tap into what your audience

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:27,199
already knows and make it a little bit

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,910
easier for them to ramp up for example

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,210
if I asked you to explain what a hash

00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:34,549
was how might you answer it's kind of a

00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:37,250
tough question is a hash a container for

00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:40,070
a set of keys and values great what does

00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,480
that actually mean is it a bag is it a

00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,919
bucket you reach into and keep checking

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,840
to see if you got the thing you wanted

00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:46,760
throw it back if it's not or is it more

00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,320
like a filing system where you look up

00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,710
values by the label that you put on a

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,330
folder as you think about this keep in

00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:55,520
mind which representation makes the most

00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:58,370
sense and conveys the most truth to the

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,669
learner if it's simple but wrong it's

00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:03,350
not

00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:04,850
to help you at all for them that kind of

00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:10,100
leads me to my next point which is

00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:12,019
creating a clean noiseless visual as an

00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,759
illustrator and a technologist I spend a

00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:15,230
lot of time getting into the weeds sort

00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,480
of getting into the nitty-gritty details

00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,769
of how things work while I'm in the

00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,869
process of wrapping my brain around

00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:22,759
something it's really hard for me to

00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:25,029
draw a clear and concise picture because

00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:27,710
I get bogged down in all the details

00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:29,389
this illustration for example shows many

00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:33,350
different systems of the body overlaid

00:18:29,389 --> 00:18:35,749
one on top of the other someone who is

00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:37,730
concerned with say heart health or the

00:18:35,749 --> 00:18:40,070
location of major arteries in the body

00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:42,350
will most likely be interested in the

00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:44,330
third diagram here it's not that the

00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:46,999
location of the muscles bones and nerves

00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:48,739
isn't also important it's just removing

00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:50,330
them from this diagram so we can see the

00:18:48,739 --> 00:18:50,980
facet that we're focusing on more

00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,149
clearly

00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,859
once I'm really solid in my own

00:18:53,149 --> 00:18:56,989
understanding of the subject I find it a

00:18:54,859 --> 00:18:58,609
lot easier to depict just what's

00:18:56,989 --> 00:19:02,659
important and get rid of the noise

00:18:58,609 --> 00:19:04,369
because I know it's noise for example

00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:07,489
does your audience need to know the

00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:09,019
entire content and the HTTP requests

00:19:07,489 --> 00:19:11,989
that a client sends to the server or

00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:13,669
will arrows suffice this drawing is fine

00:19:11,989 --> 00:19:15,559
for helping explain the general flow of

00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:17,119
a request that hits the database but is

00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:18,470
really not great for explaining routing

00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:23,450
or how the client knows where to send

00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:24,799
the requests that might be fine it also

00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,989
includes semi-concrete

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,450
examples in your illustrations showing a

00:19:26,989 --> 00:19:31,309
use case versus showing abstractly how

00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,960
something supposed to work can help

00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:35,929
bring your example into the realm of

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,970
your audience expertise so this diagram

00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:40,100
is a depicting a depiction of an

00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:42,889
imaginary message queue and the system's

00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,629
it talks to a user service picks up on a

00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:46,999
new user registering for a program and

00:19:44,629 --> 00:19:49,850
sends out a message the message queue is

00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:51,950
listening note the ear and it broadcast

00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:54,109
this message out to other services which

00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:56,330
are also listening with their own tiny

00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:59,090
ears they can then do whatever they need

00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:00,919
to in response so this diagram is

00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:03,679
helpful to show someone who's familiar

00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:05,119
with these imaginary services where we

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,369
expect a particular message to be

00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:09,799
broadcast and which systems could pick

00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:11,629
up on it but it really doesn't tell you

00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:12,350
anything about the how or the content of

00:20:11,629 --> 00:20:14,639
these

00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:16,740
in case like this you would get into

00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:21,450
that later this would be your high level

00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:24,090
sort of map of where things are this

00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:25,889
brings us to making it memorable if you

00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:29,429
provoke an emotional response in the

00:20:25,889 --> 00:20:31,110
users mind humor empathy you're leaving

00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:32,549
this idea even more strongly into their

00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:34,440
minds you're making an impression it's

00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:36,360
gonna stick with them I like to think of

00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,529
this as like you throw an idea at the

00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,389
wall of someone's brain and then you

00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:40,919
just stick tape on it the more different

00:20:39,389 --> 00:20:42,299
ways you can come at it the stickier the

00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:44,730
idea will be and the more likely they

00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:47,129
are to remember it

00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:49,139
this silly software bug as actual bug

00:20:47,129 --> 00:20:51,419
drawing is an example of using humor to

00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:52,860
drive a point home if you can keep the

00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:54,240
image of two caterpillars on a branch

00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,549
that can't get around each other in mind

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,110
the idea of a program running into

00:20:56,549 --> 00:21:03,029
deadlocks is a lot easier to think about

00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:04,289
and reason around regardless whatever

00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:06,110
you're depicting you'll want your

00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:08,370
drawing to be clear and understandable

00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:10,259
these examples that I'm going to show

00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:11,519
you will demonstrate a few formats that

00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:16,019
have helped give me some structure in

00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:18,029
the past when I'm thinking about how to

00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:19,440
model relationships different pieces of

00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:22,379
data have to each other in my

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,799
applications I like to draw out an ER D

00:21:22,379 --> 00:21:27,210
or an entity relationship diagram this

00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:31,190
kind of diagram is perfect for showing

00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:33,179
how one thing relates to another thing

00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:35,070
we can show different kinds of

00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:37,409
relationships between entities using

00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:39,659
different kinds of lines for example

00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:42,929
this branching line here is known as a

00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:45,750
crows foot ah and it indicates that one

00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:47,429
entity can have many of another a user

00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:50,279
has many blog posts that they may have

00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:51,840
authored a user has many favorites that

00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:54,389
they have maybe favorited someone else's

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,269
blog post but you can only favorite one

00:21:54,389 --> 00:21:59,610
blog post at a time and a blog post can

00:21:57,269 --> 00:22:01,110
only be authored by one person you can

00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,519
get really detailed with it but I

00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:08,009
usually like to try and stick to simple

00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:09,090
drawings like this a sequence diagram is

00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:11,070
really great if you need to show the

00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:12,480
order that things happen in it's really

00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:14,070
nice for when you want to show how a

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,039
request travels between different

00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:19,289
systems so each system here is its own

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:22,080
separate column we have the browser the

00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:24,300
server and the database the browser goes

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,760
ahead loads HTML it may

00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:29,100
an AJAX request for cat pictures to our

00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,320
server server ask the database hey what

00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,750
cats do you know about database sends

00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,700
back all the cats it knows about the

00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:37,110
server see realizes those records and

00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,940
throws them back on over to the browser

00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:41,340
or you can render a beautiful list of

00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:44,280
cats for your viewing pleasure there's

00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:45,690
also a lot more that you can do with

00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,520
these as you get more specialized but

00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:52,890
the gist is columns with arrows showing

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:54,360
the sequence of events visual analogies

00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:56,940
also have their place and finish

00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,980
documentation the analogies in your mind

00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,620
are hard one learning something new

00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,090
takes a lot of effort these analogies

00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,530
can help others understand the same

00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,610
concepts without going through all of

00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:09,680
the pain that you went through

00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:09,680
so I recommend sharing them if you can

00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,880
now that you know a bit more about

00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,830
creating clear concise and impactful

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,210
illustrations you may be thinking about

00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:20,060
how you can bring the practice of

00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:22,290
drawing into your daily work I

00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:24,270
personally like to keep a paper notebook

00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:25,920
around for easy scribbling but you can

00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:28,770
use any tool that works for you be it

00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:30,810
Gliffy be it a mirror board you know you

00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:35,280
don't have to physically draw this out

00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:38,120
to get the benefits of it the general

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,620
flow that's worked for me goes like this

00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:43,170
one I have to know what I want to

00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,880
understand or communicate so I have to

00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:49,470
set out and define the problem upfront

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:51,330
that way I know what to look for - I

00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:53,820
need to test that what I know is

00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:55,470
actually true test my knowledge sort of

00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:58,170
test the boundaries push on a little see

00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:03,120
falls over by observing what's happening

00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:06,330
in reality once I know that what I know

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:09,090
is true I like to sketch out the big

00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:11,040
picture so I sketch out how my idea or

00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:13,230
the concept I'm looking at fits into the

00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:16,620
picture in my mind contextualize that

00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:18,210
information once I've done that chances

00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,100
are I've got more questions so I'm gonna

00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:24,690
do some more detective work and refining

00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:26,580
and fill in the details finally do it

00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:27,990
all over again you're never going to

00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:30,390
stop having questions you're never gonna

00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:33,000
stop learning as a software engineer so

00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:35,160
the more you do this the more practice

00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,710
you get easier and more effective your

00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:41,640
drawing sessions are going to be

00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:43,590
I found that including visuals and

00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,870
diagrams and my engineering proposals

00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:47,190
has helped grabs folks attention it

00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:48,840
makes it more likely that whatever I'm

00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:49,820
proposing is going to get viewed and

00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,529
reviewed

00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:54,990
even if my visuals highlight a concept

00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:56,460
or an idea that's incorrect just having

00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:57,690
more eyeballs pointed at it makes it

00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,610
more likely any mistakes will be

00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:02,580
corrected quickly and collaboratively

00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:06,450
and 100% for collaborative

00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:08,429
problem-solving visuals can also help

00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:10,289
you out by helping you present a

00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:12,990
convincing and compelling argument for

00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:14,460
your ideas so more than just sort of

00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:16,860
giving your audience something fun to

00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:18,990
look at visuals can help folks see your

00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,549
ideas something that could be real they

00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:22,620
see it on paper they see how it might

00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:24,840
work and it seems like something that

00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:26,039
could come to fruition reality so when

00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,840
you're trying to convince other people

00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:34,020
to give your ideas shot this is really

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:35,370
nice as I progress in my career I

00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,100
continue to struggle with new

00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:39,539
information and new technologies I know

00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,309
that these are just growing pains as

00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:43,080
they deepen my understanding in one way

00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:47,159
or another it's just something that you

00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:49,260
know it's a sign of progress as we draw

00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:50,610
to a close on the talk I hope to leave

00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:53,789
you with some tools to keep making that

00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:55,049
progress to keep getting better and to

00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:57,840
share the truth that building

00:25:55,049 --> 00:26:00,059
understanding and sharing knowledge that

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,279
you have these are these both

00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:04,620
demonstrate mastery of a subject and

00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:07,799
mentorship and these to me are both

00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:09,510
signs of a mature engineer as you create

00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,440
drawings and diagrams please keep in

00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:12,210
mind that you're building your own

00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,820
mastery as you communicate to a new

00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:16,409
audience drawing out the way your system

00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,100
works and stripping away the things that

00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,840
don't matter

00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:23,490
strengthens your mental model of how it

00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:26,340
really works to be an artist is to build

00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:28,169
understanding just like artists we need

00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,669
to spend time and effort practicing and

00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:32,250
giving careful consideration to the

00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:33,659
tools to work with day to day the more

00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,549
time we spend being thoughtful and

00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:39,960
observant the stronger our understanding

00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:42,059
becomes becoming a senior technologist

00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,429
is also built on building understanding

00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:45,899
our responsibilities as we progress in

00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:48,149
the field is not only to master our

00:26:45,899 --> 00:26:50,880
craft but also to build up those around

00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:51,360
us I hope that you'll be able to use the

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,220
tips in the

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,620
presentation to create strong visuals

00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:58,320
and help get the ideas in your head out

00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:02,460
on a paper you can assess elaborate

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:05,120
refine and share them all so good luck

00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:08,190
explaining what knoweth is the diagram

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:11,490
thank you very much my twitter handle is

00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:13,679
here so get in contact with me if you

00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:16,280
have any questions and thanks very much
