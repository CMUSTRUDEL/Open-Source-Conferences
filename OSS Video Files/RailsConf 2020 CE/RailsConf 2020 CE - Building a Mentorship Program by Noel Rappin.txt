Description: 
	Building a Mentorship Program by Noel Rappin

Mentorship is a great way for a newer developer to benefit from the experience of a more senior developer. While there are lots of available resources on how to be a good mentor or mentee, there are far fewer guidelines on how to set up a mentoring program within your engineering organization. I'm doing this now, and I'll share the process with you: why we decided to start a team-wide mentorship program, how we got volunteers and how we matched them, and how we followed up and what worked and what didn't. You'll get everything you need to start a mentorship program at your organization.

hey everybody its Knoll and before I

00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:15,410
start the actual talk I just wanted

00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,939
first of all to thank you all for

00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,740
listening to this and I just wanted to

00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:21,200
mention that I was feeling a little bit

00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,610
sad and lonely not to be delivering this

00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,849
talk in front of a bunch of people at

00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:28,670
railsconf so I kind of made my own

00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:31,640
railsconf here and populated it with

00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:34,400
some of my favorite Ruby heroes so I

00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,620
hope you enjoy that and I wanted to

00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,710
apologize in advance for any weird audio

00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:43,010
problems or editing during this talk I'm

00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:44,690
doing the best I can thank you and I'm

00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:47,000
looking forward to seeing all of you in

00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:50,719
person sometime in the near future and

00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,059
now on with the talk I want to start

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,469
with telling a little secret about

00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:57,260
somebody who's running a mentorship

00:00:54,469 --> 00:01:00,050
program which is that I really don't

00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:02,359
like the word mentor and it took me a

00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,070
long time to figure out why I didn't

00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:06,789
like the word mentor but then I realized

00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:11,690
that it always kind of reminded me of

00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:14,630
this guy this is a character from the

00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:17,750
Shazam TV show of the early 70s the mid

00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:20,150
70s and he is actually referred to in

00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,970
the show only as mentor he does not have

00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:25,130
a name and I realized that because of

00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,740
that my association with mentor was like

00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,540
an old kind of weird-looking guy who was

00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,000
always being kind of a killjoy with

00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,579
advice but I think that is an incomplete

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,619
vision for what a mentor is and I'll

00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:38,509
talk a little bit more about what I

00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:40,930
think I mentor should be sort of

00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:43,610
implicitly in this talk but mostly

00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:47,180
really just wanted to show this Shazam

00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:49,250
clip so thanks for indulging that this

00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:51,530
is building a mentorship program I'm no

00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,210
lapin I work for route insurance in

00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,729
based in Columbus but I work in Chicago

00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:57,740
and you can reach me on Twitter at Noll

00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:59,299
rap that's the best place to find me you

00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,930
can also find me online at Norrell

00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:04,969
rapping comm I really hope that you will

00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,430
ask any questions or give any comments

00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:10,220
over twitter at an oil wrap but really

00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,840
appreciate that to give a high-level

00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:15,230
overview of what i'm going to talk about

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:19,669
here i started a mentorship program at

00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:21,799
route and ii don't really know how well

00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:22,490
it's going it's been about three months

00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:24,560
i know that it's

00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,690
going a little bit okay but I don't have

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,730
really great details on it so this is

00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,500
not gonna be like a scientific study or

00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:34,340
anything but I do think I have some

00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,420
thoughts about what I did and what I was

00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,740
comfortable with doing what I was not

00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,870
comfortable with doing that might help

00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:42,470
you as you try to set up a program like

00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:45,130
this at your own company so why do you a

00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:47,570
mentorship program with a lot of

00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:49,700
interventions or the kinds of things

00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,650
that you try to do to fix teams or

00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,450
improve the way your team works I think

00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,290
it's important to start with what

00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,200
problem

00:02:54,290 --> 00:03:00,110
you are trying to solve so let me back

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,650
up a little bit and tell you about my

00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:05,870
team at root root is about five years

00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:09,110
old as an entire company is a start-up

00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:10,910
obviously and is now just under I think

00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,260
150 engineers right now it was about a

00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,450
hundred and twenty-one I started the

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,270
mentorship program it had been growing

00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:19,940
fairly rapidly with the result that most

00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:22,570
engineers at root have been here less

00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:25,040
than two years which means that it is a

00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,110
relatively new engineering team that

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,750
doesn't have experience moving people

00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:31,010
forward that said it's a pretty strong

00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,290
engineering team it's got a lot of

00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:36,440
really talented people who have done a

00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:39,140
lot of really cool things one of the

00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:42,050
first things that I did when I got to

00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:45,700
read about six months ago was I wound up

00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:47,930
interviewing a bunch of team team leads

00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,630
and I learned a lot of interesting stuff

00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:52,880
about the way route works internally

00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:55,070
that I probably can't or shouldn't share

00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,100
publicly but one of the things that

00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:59,480
caught my ear was that many of the team

00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,550
leads or at least a couple of the team

00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,760
leads mentioned that they had informal

00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:07,880
mentorship arrangements with more junior

00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:10,430
members of the route team and that was

00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,060
interesting to me because I didn't first

00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,090
of all didn't know what was happening

00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,970
and obviously there's evidence that a

00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:18,799
mentorship relationship is good for both

00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,200
sides it's obviously good for the mentee

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:25,400
to have access to the mentors experience

00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:27,500
but it is also good for the mentor to be

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:31,760
in a role of teaching and be in a role

00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:34,910
of having to articulate what they do so

00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,170
looking at those mentors who you know

00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,670
seem to be pretty happy with how they

00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:40,220
were doing it seemed like a mentorship

00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:41,810
program was a pretty low cost but

00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,080
potentially pretty high benefit way to

00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:47,840
improve the way route handled career

00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,400
growth so although people were pretty

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,870
satisfied with the way team leads work I

00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,120
think there was at the time I did this

00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:55,700
some ambiguity about the way career

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,580
growth worked at route and also sort of

00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:02,270
the general ambiguity and confusion that

00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:04,550
that often newer engineers face as they

00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:06,860
try to take on more senior skills and

00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,540
they try to find a role model to help

00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,090
them do that

00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:13,610
so in my position at root as a person

00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:15,140
with no authority over this whatsoever I

00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:18,470
decided to start a mentorship program

00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:20,390
the senior leadership the very senior

00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,970
leadership of route engineering wisc was

00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:26,480
quite supportive and basically gave me

00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:29,150
some time to put this together which led

00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,280
to kind of the obvious question of like

00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,350
how do you start a mentorship program

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,140
which is I guess mostly what I'm gonna

00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,460
be talking about for the rest of this

00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:39,170
there's a lot of advice online about how

00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,850
to be a good mentor there's a lot of

00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:43,430
advice online about how to be a good

00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,140
mentee by the way I hate the word mentee

00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,790
probably even more than I dislike the

00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,170
word mentor but I don't have a better

00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:51,050
word for that either so we're gonna

00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:53,210
stick with mentee here there is not a

00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,460
whole lot of advice about how to set up

00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:58,820
sort of a culture of mentorship or build

00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:01,780
up a larger mentorship program within an

00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:04,580
organization so I started to think about

00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:08,060
what the goals of a mentorship program

00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:11,210
would be and in this case the main goal

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,830
was to promote career growth among the

00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,720
mentees and that would be career growth

00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,120
not just along the sort of route

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,620
engineering career ladder but also in

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,930
the more general sense of helping them

00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,930
become better engineers and pick up more

00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:26,120
senior engineering skills

00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,890
the only real note that I got from route

00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,570
senior engineering as I tried to set

00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:33,050
this up was that they felt fairly

00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:34,790
strongly that the primary role in the

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,169
relationship should belong to the mentee

00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:39,169
that the mentee should be responsible

00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:41,360
for setting up scheduling and to some

00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:42,470
extent setting the agenda and that they

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,610
did not want to have they wanted the

00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,790
mentee to sort of own the relationship

00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,170
and own their own

00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,270
and not have that be the mentors

00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,950
responsibility so that became an

00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,690
important goal in designing the program

00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:53,700
and now I'm gonna take a sip of water

00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:56,000
and regret that I did not take a picture

00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:59,040
of leggo me drinking a cup of water to

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,510
cover that moment I guess I could auto

00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,770
idiot Auto edit it out if I chose to so

00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:07,290
if you hear this I didn't edit it out

00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,640
anyway the idea here was also to give

00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:10,800
mentors a chance to learn and improve

00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,360
communication skills actually mentorship

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,890
is explicitly a part of the career

00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,450
ladder for seniors but there's no sort

00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:19,200
of formal or structured way for them to

00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:20,730
show that skill within route before this

00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,420
mentorship program they did it in other

00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:26,670
ways this was meant to be a sort of a

00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:28,050
more explicit way for them to do it also

00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,540
in the long term I wanted it to be

00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:32,900
self-sustaining I did not want to be the

00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:35,040
blocker on the mentorship program in

00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,320
perpetuity I wanted the sort of the

00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,830
mentors and the mentees together to sort

00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:43,020
to own the program and and how it works

00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:46,500
so with that in mind the next question

00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:50,160
was again like sort of not what the

00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:52,890
thing is that the the thing that had to

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,620
be done really was to enable a set of

00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:57,210
mentor mentee matches to be created I

00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,370
also not quite sure whether I prefer

00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,320
matching or pair for the mentor mentee

00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,780
relationship I'll probably go back and

00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:06,390
forth I tend to choose match anyway

00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:10,440
matching the concept of matching a group

00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:12,750
of people really scared me I knew it was

00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,130
critical to the way the program was

00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,990
going to work and whether it was going

00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:19,770
to work at all and yet at the same time

00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:22,410
like this sort of matchmaking is is very

00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:24,990
uncertain um compounded by the fact that

00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:28,320
I don't know it didn't know most of the

00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:30,870
participants the route engineering team

00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,820
is primarily based in Columbus I work in

00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:35,700
Chicago so I did not have day-to-day

00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:38,460
interactions with approximately 85 to 90

00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,260
percent engineers so I would sort of

00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,330
necessity be going off their own

00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,280
self-reported wishes for what they

00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:47,510
wanted out of the program for better or

00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:50,160
for worse um a thing that really

00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,390
concerned me and I didn't didn't didn't

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,730
don't know what the best way to handle

00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,900
it and I'm not sure whether I'm not sure

00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,010
with or what I did is the best way to

00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:59,240
handle it

00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,440
handle it I did I suppose is the

00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,430
question of what to do with people who

00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:06,019
are members of underrepresented groups

00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:09,230
people in an underrepresented group

00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:10,970
often but not always prefer a mentor who

00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:13,310
is of the same group and can sort of

00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:16,399
share their life experiences and give

00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:18,200
them a path forward that is kind of

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,620
specific to the experiences of their

00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,529
group at the same time I didn't want to

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,940
assume that person a member of a

00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:28,700
particular underrepresented group would

00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,769
always want to have a mentor from that

00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,519
group I didn't want to soon they never

00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:36,019
would either and asking flat-out

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:39,170
explicitly asking flat-out also seemed

00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:41,149
problematic so with that in mind was

00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,529
with none of the potential options

00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:45,320
looking good

00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:48,560
I really thought hard about how to plan

00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,630
for making matches involving engineers

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,180
who are members of underrepresented

00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:56,510
groups the other thing that I sort of

00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:59,390
fell back on is the idea that especially

00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:01,970
in personnel issues where there is

00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:04,399
uncertainty try to be as transparent as

00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:07,399
possible and make the stakes as low as

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,680
possible those were my guiding

00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,240
principles as I put together the program

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,709
in the matching process trying to be

00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,360
transparent and trying to make the

00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:17,660
stakes of the match as low as possible

00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:20,079
so that people felt more comfortable

00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:23,540
with it so here's what I actually did

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,190
and and you can obviously quibble with

00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,860
this in many different dimensions but

00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:29,600
here's what I did the first step I did

00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,520
was I asked for mentors I did not ask

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,750
for think for mentors and mentees at the

00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:39,320
same time I asked for the mentors first

00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:42,260
I sent out a survey for people who

00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:45,440
wanted to be mentors I did not limit it

00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,060
to people of any particular level I did

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,610
limit it to people who are in the

00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,260
engineering team I asked them for a

00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:53,630
picture which I actually wound up not

00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,579
using for no principled reason it was

00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:58,910
just complicated to set up the the image

00:10:55,579 --> 00:11:01,130
storage and I asked the mentors for

00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:04,339
their level of experience how long

00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:06,560
they'd been at root I asked them for a

00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:07,260
list of topics I gave a sample list of

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,370
about a dozen

00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,010
things that they felt that they could

00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:13,110
mentor people Anna and then I asked them

00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:15,690
both a public-facing why do you want to

00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:17,820
be a mentor and then a private facing is

00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:21,270
there anything I should know about who

00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:22,770
you want to mentor question and so I

00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:25,290
sent that out for give those up gave a

00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:27,480
few days for people to apply into that

00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:29,490
program and once that was in place only

00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,740
then did I ask for the mentees and the

00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,000
idea here was that again off the

00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,680
principle of the mentee should be in

00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,810
control of this and wanted the mentees

00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,600
to see the list of potential mentors

00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:42,420
when they signed up for the program so

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,800
the mentees got a similar form I asked

00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,920
them the same level of experience

00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,870
question I asked them the question of

00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,460
topics the level of experience by the

00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,800
way was because I wanted to try to avoid

00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:55,020
unless there was a really component

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,910
reason to do it I wanted to avoid having

00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:59,790
a mentor that technically had less

00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:01,440
expertise than the mentee so as the

00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:03,840
mentee is the same experience a topic

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,670
question and again the mentees both got

00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,280
a public what are you looking for in a

00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:09,990
mentor and then a private what are you

00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,700
looking for in the mentor the intention

00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:15,150
here which was implicit but not

00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:17,940
particularly explicit was that the

00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:19,290
private list would be the intention here

00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:22,170
was that the private list would be with

00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:25,440
a mentee would say I would really prefer

00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:30,170
a mentor who has X characteristic or as

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:32,550
a member of Y group and I think a

00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:34,290
definitely nonzero number of people took

00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:36,030
advantage of that to make more specific

00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,560
requests more to the point I gave

00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,680
mentees the option of selecting up to

00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,050
three specific mentors as their first

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,790
choices which also gave the mentees the

00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,530
ability to self select or make their

00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:48,630
intentions known or choose among

00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:51,620
criteria other than the ones that I was

00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:54,090
like offering because they might know

00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,950
the mentees most of the mentors and

00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:57,390
mentees did work in the Columba's office

00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:00,000
and had much more of a chance of knowing

00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:02,490
each other so that they would be able to

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,230
pick hey this is a person I really do

00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,060
get along with or this is a person who I

00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:08,370
know shares this particular interest as

00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:13,710
a member you know as a member of this

00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:16,830
particular group so that was the idea in

00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:19,410
the end we wound up with 33 mentors and

00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,970
41 mentees with a little bit of overlap

00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,890
a few people

00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:25,620
requested to be both mentors and mentees

00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:27,720
which I thought was actually great so I

00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:30,690
think I wound up with sixty five people

00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:34,140
total something like that and at that

00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:36,570
point I needed to match now obviously I

00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:38,190
had more mentees than mentors the

00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:39,920
mentors have been asked whether they be

00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:42,890
willing to handle more than one person

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,200
so I used that as part of the criteria

00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:48,570
to match people I tried to make it as

00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,950
transparent in sort of algorithmic as

00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,450
possible with the understanding that

00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:54,810
it's never gonna perfectly be

00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:57,230
algorithmic I went through the mentee

00:13:54,810 --> 00:14:00,180
forms sort of in the order they arrived

00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:02,210
and if the mentee made a choice through

00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,990
master the highest available choice

00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,940
unless there was some reason why it

00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:08,010
didn't make sense to do so if they

00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,260
didn't give a choice I tried to use the

00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:12,270
overlapping interests and the levels and

00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,100
whatever to make as good a match as I

00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:16,680
could I tried to get a mentor where the

00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,510
mentor was one one level up on the route

00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,510
ladder if possible it was not always

00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:24,740
possible and then I did kind of a second

00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:27,240
path this was more or less a cleanup

00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:29,580
some of the mentors had not been chosen

00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,200
other people had like three or four

00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:35,280
people who had picked them and I'd tried

00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:39,810
to sort of even that out as best I could

00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:41,640
tried to give the mentors who who had

00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,900
explicitly recommended more than one

00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,310
more than one mentor the people would

00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,870
say that maybe want to do it I tried to

00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,910
avoid it anyway you kind of get the

00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:51,420
point try to give people mentors who are

00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:52,890
closer to their level and then uh that

00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,450
so that that to me covered the

00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,670
transparency part I tried to give them

00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:58,410
mentees as much power as possible over

00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:01,260
the matching and I tried to make the

00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:04,500
matching process as like transparent and

00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:06,720
and and clear as I felt like I could

00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,090
conceivably make it the part where I

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,070
tried to make it low stakes was that I

00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:13,530
very clearly and explicitly and

00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,720
repeatedly set the expectation that it

00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:17,490
is absolutely okay for either side in

00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,610
the relationship to end it to end the

00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,660
mentor match for any reason at all there

00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,490
are all kinds of relatively benign

00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,890
reasons why this match might not work

00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,940
people might be logistical incompatible

00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:29,580
they might be in different time zones

00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:32,310
they might it might turn out that their

00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:34,200
interests don't actually overlap and

00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,780
that is those are benign reasons and

00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,250
also

00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,750
are less benign reasons you could just

00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:40,210
not like each other there could be some

00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:42,520
other thing going on in any case I made

00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:44,110
it clear that there was no like lengthy

00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,460
process to stop the relationship you

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,990
didn't have to justify it at all you

00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:49,930
just had to say this is not working

00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:52,360
either side and we would attempt to

00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:55,570
repair the mentee to the best of my

00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,070
ability that the goal of doing that was

00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:59,290
to try and give the mentees in

00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:01,750
particular as much control over the

00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:03,970
relationship as possible and not make

00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:06,100
people think they were being made to

00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:08,140
have a relationship with a specific

00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:13,030
person that they could get out of it at

00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:15,460
any time with no with no stigma against

00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:17,080
it like that is the expected part of the

00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,660
program that these relationships will

00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,880
start and stop on a regular basis for

00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,320
any reason we also explicitly said that

00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,780
at the six-month mark which we have not

00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,160
reached yet will explicitly ask people

00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,770
whether they want to keep going or

00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:32,050
scramble it up again the point is to

00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:33,130
make it an explicit like expected part

00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:36,570
of the culture of this mentorship

00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:40,360
program that these matches our temporary

00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:42,400
if you need them to be so that was that

00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,140
was sort of the the the best that I

00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,220
could think up with within my own

00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:51,339
limitations as to how to make this like

00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:54,880
as fair and useful a relationship as

00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:56,760
possible I published the list I went to

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,220
Columbus and met with everybody

00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:01,180
everybody in the program and I shared

00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,400
essentially what I had shared with you

00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,930
what I've shared with you so far and I

00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,910
made some suggestions as to how to move

00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:10,660
forward I did not make a lot of

00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:12,939
structured suggestions I suggested a 30

00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:16,630
to 60 minute meeting every two weeks or

00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:18,490
so as being a useful cadence and again

00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:21,760
said that the mentee was responsible for

00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:24,250
doing that scheduling I further

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,579
suggested really only that the focus of

00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:29,170
the meetings being the mentees goals for

00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,430
their career for what they wanted to

00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:32,740
learn in the next six months but that

00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:34,570
that was a since by and large the

00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:37,240
mentors and the mentees were not on the

00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:39,790
same team at root I tried to keep the

00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,700
focus of the mentor mentee meetings away

00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:44,740
from immediate like project goals and

00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,420
had the focus be on the mentees career

00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,470
growth goals and I suggested a couple

00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:51,700
activities to

00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:53,789
and solicit goals for the mentees and

00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:57,429
then basically set up a slack channel

00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:59,380
which has been pretty low energy and

00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:01,990
then I left it alone for six weeks on

00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:04,210
theory that someone flawed theory that I

00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:06,700
kind of wanted to see what happened and

00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:10,539
the like specific practical problem that

00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:12,669
I was busy and doing other things but I

00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:15,909
mostly just let these things sort of

00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:17,919
ride for about six weeks in retrospect I

00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:20,679
kind of wish I'd been a little bit more

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,720
present but I'm not sure that it made

00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:24,250
that much of a difference so you're

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,919
probably curious as to what happened to

00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:28,299
the extent that I know what happened one

00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:30,640
of the interesting things that happened

00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:32,770
was that I got a lot of relatively

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,890
senior people looking for mentors more

00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:37,570
than I expected which was particularly

00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:40,450
hard to match because the number of like

00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:44,350
very senior people who were there tore

00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:45,640
able to mentor like less senior people

00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:49,840
less senior was still pretty senior

00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:52,900
people was not very high and and so that

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,280
had that had both the effect of those

00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,890
people were hard to match and I had kind

00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:00,130
of the second-order effect that it meant

00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:02,919
that the very very senior mentors in the

00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:04,539
program were mostly paired with like

00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:07,390
relatively senior people rather than

00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:09,190
relatively entry-level people for better

00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,120
or worse I don't know I don't know

00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,640
whether it's better or worse there's

00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,710
just kind of a thing that happened um as

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,990
far as the matches go there was an

00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:18,990
initial handful of requests for changes

00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:25,419
maybe four or five less certainly less

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,610
than ten most of those changes were

00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:29,140
logistical people again timezone

00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:31,270
incompatible there were a couple people

00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,799
who there was one couple cases where

00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:35,320
people had an existing relationship and

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,240
hadn't like clearly communicated to me

00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:40,450
are more likely had communicated it to

00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,400
me but I misinterpreted it and so there

00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:44,080
were just a couple of switches that I

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,840
needed to make up it was not an

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,809
avalanche by any means and they were all

00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:52,929
able to be accommodated after that

00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:55,770
initial flurry I've gotten something

00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:58,929
like zero requests to change mentors um

00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:00,039
that's honestly too few and I suspect

00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:01,509
that what's happening is that

00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:03,070
people who the mentorships don't click

00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:04,690
are just dropping out of the program

00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:07,450
rather than requesting different mentors

00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:10,539
I don't know that for a fact but it's it

00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:12,220
seems it certainly seems plausible I

00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:14,649
kind of suspect that that's what's going

00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:17,409
on at the six week mark I surveyed all

00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:20,100
the mentor mentorship pairs and I got 40

00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:22,539
responses which is about a 60% response

00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,950
give or take like some people who are in

00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:25,749
multiple relationships fill them out

00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:27,669
once for each relationship and some

00:20:25,749 --> 00:20:30,759
people didn't so there's no it's not

00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:34,450
really clear it was about 60% but about

00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:36,519
three-fifths of the people replied and

00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,960
almost half of those people were in

00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:40,389
pairs that had met three or more times

00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,149
in the six weeks which meant that they

00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:45,909
had really started with and had begun to

00:20:43,149 --> 00:20:47,349
follow a regular schedule which was a

00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:49,539
little surprising to me that that was

00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:50,710
that high I was I was like you really

00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:53,769
had to have your act together to meet

00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:56,889
three times in six weeks and I was

00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:58,090
really pleased with that result a third

00:20:56,889 --> 00:21:00,849
of the relation of the rest of the

00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:03,399
respondents met twice the rest of them

00:21:00,849 --> 00:21:05,649
had met once so even if the most

00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:08,499
pessimistic assumption is that nobody

00:21:05,649 --> 00:21:10,149
else in the program had met at all that

00:21:08,499 --> 00:21:14,889
means that about half the groups were

00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:16,960
meeting regularly my initial conception

00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:20,499
was that probably about a quarter to the

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,119
third groups would do that so I was I

00:21:20,499 --> 00:21:24,399
was actually fairly pleased with this

00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:26,169
the comments that came in which I'm not

00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:28,929
gonna really put up because they were

00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:30,879
not cleared for release and also I would

00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:33,249
just be cherry-picking them but overall

00:21:30,879 --> 00:21:35,289
people were the people who gave

00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:37,509
responses were fairly appreciative of

00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:40,239
the program and I think in at least a

00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:43,499
couple cases anecdotally it's been

00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:46,509
really successful in helping people

00:21:43,499 --> 00:21:47,830
improve their their career growth I've

00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:50,649
definitely had people reach out to me

00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:53,649
and say that also at the beginning of

00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:55,090
March we on boarded four more pairs in

00:21:53,649 --> 00:21:57,369
the India that this was a dynamic

00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:59,799
ongoing program this was actually a

00:21:57,369 --> 00:22:01,840
little bit tricky because the onion

00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:03,639
boarded pairs had like fewer mentors

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,979
available since we had a relative

00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:08,049
shortage of mentors but I did manage to

00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:09,909
parallel all four of them up I have no

00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:12,580
real sense about how those pairs are

00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:14,860
doing because well then after

00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,510
early March came bid March and you know

00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,910
you you kind of know what happened there

00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:21,250
we went to a hundred percent work at

00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:23,440
home fairly rapidly there have been a

00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,910
ton of surveys from route about how

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,350
that's going and I have been a little

00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,570
reluctant to throw another survey at

00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:31,030
people and we also haven't quite reached

00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:32,380
the second six week mark to survey again

00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:36,250
that'll actually come in a couple of

00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:39,130
days so I don't really know how many

00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:42,100
groups have kept up over the last six

00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:44,830
weeks I know that some have I definitely

00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,630
know that that my groups have but I

00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:50,770
don't know about the the program in

00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:53,080
general and I just don't sorry but I do

00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:54,670
think a couple things take away I do

00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,980
think overall this has been like

00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:58,570
successful it has cost relatively little

00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,890
time and effort on the part of route

00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,750
engineering as an organization or

00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:04,840
individual people and I think it has had

00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:06,640
some clear benefit at least for some of

00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,680
the people involved with it so if you

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,750
want to set this up in your own team I

00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,280
think you should think really hard about

00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,080
the goals of the program your

00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,820
organization's goals will probably

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,170
different from organization's goals your

00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:19,090
organization's needs will probably

00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:22,240
different from ours and and try to

00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:23,590
define what success looks like be as

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,990
thoughtful as you can about matching

00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:27,700
people up while understanding that you

00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:29,110
also need to make sure that people feel

00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,970
like they have agency in their choices

00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:33,120
that's really important to have in the

00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:35,350
program seem effective I feels to me

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,720
yeah so I think mentorship is an

00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:40,300
effective way to help team growth and I

00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:43,030
hope that this will help you allow more

00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:45,760
mentorship at your organization again

00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:46,930
thanks for listening I really wanted to

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,750
throw a joke in here involving my

00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:52,120
infamous falling laptop video so here it

00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:54,570
is starring Lego me in the following

00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,570
laptop

00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:01,330
that was not good

00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:12,680
thank you all for being a part of this

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,360
so again I'm Noelle rappin you can reach

00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,890
out to me on Twitter at an all rap I

00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,470
really appreciate it if you would ask

00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:20,810
about this or anything else I have a

00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:22,510
book in beta from pragmatics called

00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:25,040
modern front-end development for rails

00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:28,730
it's about web pecker and stimulus and

00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:31,100
react and we it should be as you listen

00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:32,570
to this fairly close to coming out for

00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,760
real we were waiting to see what got

00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:36,980
announced at railsconf before we pushed

00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,170
it all the way through there mayor Matt

00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:41,900
so you can get it at prairie comm slash

00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:44,780
book slash and our clients there may or

00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:48,260
may not be a 20% off with railsconf 2020
