	Fake It While You Make It by Kevin Murphy

"We all write code to interface with external systems, like a web service or a message queue. Can you confidently write tests without requiring the system as a dependency? How can you shield users of your code from the inner workings of the interface? Explore one attempt to answer these questions.

There's no shortage of tools at your disposal to solve these problems. This talk will introduce some available options, provide guidance on when one approach may be more appropriate than another, and discuss how to use these tools together to ease the testing process."

"Kevin spent more time investigating, refactoring, and rewriting tests for the project that prompted this talk than he did writing the actual implementation.

Kevin lives near Boston, where he is a Software Developer at The Gnar Company."
