how are you hanging I'm pretty good no

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:24,220
better than I was two or three weeks ago

00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:27,430
I'd say I think just the exclamation

00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,919
that always happens has happened yeah

00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:33,540
for me at least to to a large extent I

00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:37,480
mean the world is still up and

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:40,420
life is not back to normal but no I

00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:44,769
think week five or week six yeah our

00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:46,530
scene at the house so yeah yeah so II my

00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:49,120
eight-year-old asked me that yesterday

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,319
what week is it like what we calmly

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,690
Long's will be doing this sounds like

00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:54,609
honey I don't know I'd have to figure I

00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:57,609
was like you're lucky I know it's

00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:59,199
Thursday so yes

00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:01,449
yeah that's it's almost like we're in

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,670
like the new time calculation like time

00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:09,700
started at zero with the quarantine

00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:11,890
we're now in week of the seventh pretty

00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,240
much all right so we got a bunch of

00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,420
questions I thought we kind of wander

00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,010
around in the questions and just talk

00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,390
about various things we can kind of

00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,190
referee I'm still make it through our

00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:24,270
the whole the whole topic list and I

00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:28,270
figured we'd go about 45 minutes or so

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:31,180
but just first perhaps is just I had

00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,470
kind of hyped my my keynote and what

00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,060
that was gonna be about and I just

00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:38,350
wanted to sort of address that a little

00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:40,510
bit which was our plan was to launch a

00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:44,530
brand new product right the week

00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:47,470
actually before restaurants so we

00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:50,590
launched hey calm the week before rails

00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:52,750
come and we just had a bunch of new tech

00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:55,210
in that app that I wanted to talk about

00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:58,480
and then when all this sort of happened

00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:02,140
well I went three weeks where I did

00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,700
nothing but rant on Twitter and try to

00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,470
pressure companies into doing the right

00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,319
things and all sorts of other things

00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:10,149
except program Ruby and read progress

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,190
product and therefore also make progress

00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:14,260
on the things I wanted to talk about and

00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,519
then was kind of how I ended up with do

00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,080
you know what I just I don't have the

00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:20,620
product out I want to talk about I don't

00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:23,319
have the technology wrapped up so rather

00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,849
than do this kind of half

00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:27,760
thing where I can't actually show and

00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:30,819
tell I can just tell ya I'm gonna we're

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,129
gonna save that and kind of do that

00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:34,359
whole reveal of how we do the front end

00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:39,430
differently and hey

00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:41,859
once a is out sure so okay yeah yeah I'm

00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,269
sure that that question got asked on

00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:46,810
Twitter like it what's going on with

00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:49,389
that thing so yeah I mean we've got some

00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,639
kind of maybe adjacent stuff we get into

00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:53,200
on there you know for instance if you

00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:55,030
like if you want to get into it

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,530
one of the questions we can I guess we

00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:59,530
could just dive in what that is you know

00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,519
people were interested in stuff like you

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,469
know have you been doing anything

00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:06,340
different on mobile like you're building

00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:11,469
a you could you're building a email app

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:13,389
we presume it's an email app and people

00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:15,129
who read email on their phone so that

00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:16,510
was that may be a good like have you

00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:20,230
been working on that I mean I know that

00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:21,969
Basecamp has has an app still and so and

00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,319
that's been and I remember when you

00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:25,989
first came out with that there's been no

00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:27,939
evolution there - so yeah any thoughts

00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:29,079
on yeah no that's that's a that's a

00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:30,849
great question and I mean it goes

00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:35,439
directly to what I was going to talk

00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:38,409
about like our philosophy of making apps

00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:41,199
at Basecamp is first of all the majestic

00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:44,019
monoliths that at the center of not just

00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:46,900
the web app but at the center of all the

00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:49,239
apps lives this majestic monolith that's

00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,540
not just an API server either right like

00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:56,169
when for Basecamp for example when you

00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:58,540
in our native iOS app go to a message

00:03:56,169 --> 00:04:00,459
that rendering comes straight from that

00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,139
majestic monolith it goes straight

00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:07,180
through a controller straight through a

00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:08,560
ARB view and it spits out HTML now what

00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:12,810
has changed over the years and has

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,549
changed even more so perhaps in hey is

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:18,340
where is the border right like how much

00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:20,859
if the work comes from HTML in terms of

00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:24,009
the majestic monolith how much is sort

00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:26,110
of a native fully native application and

00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:29,050
we've added more and more native stuff

00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,900
but still that that was taking it from

00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,419
like 1% like our I had a write up I

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,500
think four or five years ago maybe even

00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:35,950
a little more where I talked about like

00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,980
hey

00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:41,860
99% of Basecamp is just the web and then

00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:44,770
there's 1% of native stuff that wraps it

00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:48,130
now it's perhaps a little more like 10%

00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:49,990
is negative 90% is still the majestic

00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:53,590
monolith and we've followed the same

00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:56,680
approach in in hey but we've just kind

00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:59,830
of doubled down and expanded upon it in

00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:04,090
a large variety of ways where we'd been

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:05,920
skim the native apps were kind of we're

00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,640
gonna ask the thought we sort of had it

00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,480
in mind

00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:12,460
but with hey we started with the native

00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:16,060
apps writing one I mean this whole idea

00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:18,790
of building an email app that doesn't is

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:22,450
nice and the phone makes no sense surfer

00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:24,370
for base camp I get something like 70 or

00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:27,790
80 percent is still actually desktop use

00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:29,830
we have 20 to 30 percent on mobile but

00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,870
you go to email and it's probably the

00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,760
other way around right like it's

00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,980
probably 80 percent is going to be on

00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,110
yeah on the phone and 20 percent is

00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,700
going to be on the desktop so we went

00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,830
from the start and said like deist oh

00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,200
just have to be good they have to be

00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:46,060
great and I've got to do the full native

00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,560
thing right from the get-go in I think

00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,990
perhaps they're it's it's interesting

00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,390
where we picked a different path and

00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,980
then some like our native app wrappers

00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:59,020
they're written in complete native we

00:05:53,980 --> 00:06:01,450
don't use a ionic or some other way of

00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,580
kind of getting to the native stuff we

00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:05,920
have fully native teams that work in an

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:09,580
iOS they were pinched in Swift and they

00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,900
used all the default Apple stuff yeah

00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,890
and then they just put web views

00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:17,800
everywhere right yeah not just web views

00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:21,040
but er buildings web views triple links

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,630
sort of forms the core of all this

00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,850
interaction since that it's fast and

00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:26,020
it's not continuously reloading and and

00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,970
all these other things and we do the

00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:31,300
same thing on on Android on Android we

00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:33,910
use cotton and we use again the standard

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:37,300
Android setup and we can kind of we can

00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:38,410
do that because we have native teams how

00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,300
many of these teams are still tiny

00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:43,030
though we have two programmers on each

00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,890
side to Android programmers to iOS

00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:48,010
programmers and a designer for each team

00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:49,720
so it's teams of three on iOS they

00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:53,230
handle ball

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,850
the iPad and the iPhone and probably

00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:58,450
owns are gonna handle the mac app for

00:06:54,850 --> 00:07:00,660
for hey and then on Android well it's

00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:03,400
mostly Android the the phone right so

00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,710
but kind of like the philosophy of the

00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,480
approach has remained the same like for

00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:10,450
me what I want to write I want to write

00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:13,600
Ruby yeah I not only do I want to write

00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:15,760
Ruby I want to write as little sort of I

00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,370
want to write as much of the application

00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,830
in Ruby as possible so that's the other

00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:23,200
thing where we've kind of taken a

00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:25,240
different path and the rest most of the

00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,100
rest of the industry is that our

00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,240
majestic monolith again is not just

00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:32,970
about an API server

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:35,650
it really has HTML on its core and we

00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:38,260
try to do as much as we can cystic we

00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:41,020
can write applications in kind of like

00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:42,760
the vintage style yeah I like to think

00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:45,430
it was like in terms of developer

00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:48,940
ergonomics the peak of the web happened

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:50,500
in like 2004 in terms of them think

00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,790
about like oh well then that means just

00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,580
like you're just stuck in your ways this

00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:56,860
is just no like look at what it

00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:00,720
takes to develop a modern app with like

00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:03,190
a full api split distributed system

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,500
react on the front end the whole shebang

00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:06,520
right the number of moving pieces is

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,890
just enormous

00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,870
now some people go like well that's just

00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:17,590
what we have to do that's what modern is

00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:20,040
and we just win no we can get virtually

00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:23,380
all the benefits you get from that model

00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:25,840
in the traditional approach with the

00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:28,510
traditional economics that just makes

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,660
that wonderful rails productive

00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:34,570
experience by going through things like

00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:37,990
triple links and I mean then the rest of

00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:40,240
the picture was sort of what I was gonna

00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:42,910
present and I'll talk about later yeah

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,770
yeah but general philosophy is that yeah

00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:47,380
I think it's you know it's such an

00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:49,450
interesting approach to because it

00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,520
allows you to keep I imagine I guess I

00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:54,250
imagine it's the ability to keep your or

00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,960
your design team small right because you

00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,330
imagine like if you have a if you have

00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,530
all native like no none of this if

00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,400
you're like I'm gonna be able to

00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,530
completely made

00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,090
app then you're like okay great like I

00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,920
have three different designer design

00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:07,120
teams because I got a design the one and

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,390
I got a design now so what am I gonna

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,490
decide the third one is yeah that really

00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:15,130
probably is the number one benefit here

00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:16,620
is that we picked this architecture not

00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:19,450
just because we think it's a good

00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,400
technological approach I think it is I

00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,560
think it's great I think it's a lot of

00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,620
fun but we picked it because it works

00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:30,370
for our company sighs sure like we are

00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:32,440
56 people at Basecamp 15 of those are

00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:34,780
even a little more on the support like

00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:38,620
we have very small teams as I said like

00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:39,790
Android there's three people for all of

00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,950
it right Brian

00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:44,140
yes and I've had three people all that

00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:47,110
could they rebuilt an app like Basecamp

00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:49,930
from scratch in native there's like 260

00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:54,010
screens or more never ever going to

00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:56,160
happen you'd need a team of of tens of

00:09:54,010 --> 00:10:00,760
people right that's our entire

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:02,170
development team support again - you

00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,530
have to have a different support for iOS

00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,300
- then - yes yes and like we just we

00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:09,820
didn't want to do that right you look at

00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,260
our we call the core product um that's

00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:15,910
the team that develop all the features

00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:18,640
under whip it's for developers like that

00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:20,680
yeah that's it like and the reason we

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,870
can we can have such small group like

00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,840
you count all that up right so to

00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:28,450
developers on Android to developers on

00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:31,390
on iOS and then for that's eight

00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:33,790
developers basically making the whole

00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:36,190
app right right for everything on all

00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:38,560
the platforms at once that's just not

00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:41,110
compatible with like recreate everything

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,970
everywhere do the whole thing is like

00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,590
this big distributor that and I think

00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,500
I'm glad you asked about the designers

00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:50,080
because I think that's also which

00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,340
weirdly unique I look it like why aren't

00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,950
more people doing it and all of our

00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,720
designers they don't just like draw

00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:58,900
right like that's not what the sign

00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,580
means a very skimp they make like all of

00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:03,190
our designers they write their own

00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:05,320
JavaScript they write their own Ruby on

00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,090
Rails code now it's not necessarily the

00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,370
final thing but every single developer

00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,840
or designer we have they can stand up

00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,370
like hey here's what the features going

00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,510
to look at now if it's complicated on

00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,529
the backend obviously

00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:17,440
program is gonna come in and they're

00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:19,000
gonna help with it but like a lot of

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,709
features we actually have there they'll

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,160
end up fully skipping just off a

00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:26,230
designer yes because they can write like

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,269
right Ruby rest is approachable enough

00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,889
that like if you're a designer who knows

00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:31,720
how to make HTML you know how to make

00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:33,639
the CSS you can jump into it you can

00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,180
figure it out and I think that's also

00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:38,199
one of those things that's unique about

00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:40,750
Ruby and why it's just such a wonderful

00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:43,060
language is it like it allows people to

00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,290
make that small jump from JavaScript

00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,630
like hey I know a little bit JavaScript

00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:48,040
just like hey I also I can do it in Ruby

00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:50,320
and then they can put full Sebastian

00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,630
because they own the whole stack right

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,820
what generalist at Basecamp can ship an

00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:59,320
entire feature to everyone on every

00:11:54,820 --> 00:12:00,850
platform at once right absolutely is you

00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,529
compare that to a lot of other

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,209
organizations and how they're set up and

00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:06,190
it's absolutely not how it is right like

00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:08,470
I've been ranting about this idea of

00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:11,079
specialization like we've really gotten

00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,699
to the point where in a lot of

00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:14,699
organizations the layers are getting

00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:19,420
sliced thinner thinner yeah well I

00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:22,000
front-end engineer for like this yeah

00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:26,589
well that is just such a small

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,870
slice compared to hey at Basecamp there

00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:30,250
might be sort of leaning so you have a

00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,560
preference but like everyone can do

00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,839
everything and they do it most of the

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,579
time yeah so it's like good this is a

00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:39,880
good segue into another another Kinect

00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:43,000
question I had which is so Basecamp has

00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:45,120
been well prior to the 37 cycles prior

00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,519
has been around for how long it's been

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,620
20 years almost 20 years yeah so it'd be

00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:52,420
interesting you're like you know we're

00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,889
not to go super super long on this but

00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,569
like it'd be interesting like if you

00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:56,829
think back on like where you were and

00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:58,389
where you started do you feel like

00:12:56,829 --> 00:12:59,980
you've like obviously things have

00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:01,690
changed as technology's changed we've

00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,310
all gotten older every like we're stuck

00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:05,230
at home now we were stuck at home 20

00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,910
years ago but it'd be interesting like

00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,949
to kind of get your feeling like do you

00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:10,569
feel like if you were to look if you

00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:12,069
were to project forward or look

00:13:10,569 --> 00:13:13,389
backwards either either direction and

00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:16,120
say like dude I think it would look like

00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:17,860
this are you there or what has surprised

00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,980
you guys have been fairly consistent in

00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:23,079
that time this is a good question I

00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:26,270
think my overall take and maybe it is

00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:28,370
just because I'm I'm getting old and

00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:30,590
much in that heart is just like things

00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:34,310
just don't change that rapidly like I

00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:36,050
look at I look at the original Ruby and

00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:38,170
rails codes that I wrote like what is

00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:41,330
that like 16 17 years ago

00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:45,410
you don't speak that much to see how we

00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:46,670
still write apps right in fact um if

00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:49,130
anything and maybe that's like in that

00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:50,870
nostalgia and I can just imagine kind of

00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,820
like well this just proves that you're

00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:55,070
old and like you can't evolve applause

00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:58,310
but like I'm holding back to that and

00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:59,510
like do you know what it it's funny it's

00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:01,910
kind of like the same thing with music

00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:04,040
right a lot of people that they'll go

00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:05,990
with they're most the time in their life

00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,010
that was most formative that's when they

00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:11,150
attract the most sort of stubborn

00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:20,600
preferences for music they're like ready

00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:23,600
if your life was great in 84 so I'll

00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,130
accept that right up front but some of

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,460
this again goes back to this sense that

00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:31,760
like dad developer ergonomics experience

00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:36,230
that we had in the early days 2004 2002

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,790
2008 before kind of the pressure of what

00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:40,100
you needed to do on the front end with

00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:42,500
JavaScript was was kind of tearing

00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,990
things apart I'm holding on to that like

00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:48,640
the 84 hairband right like this

00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:51,050
is so this was the peak in many ways of

00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:53,120
of the developer ergonomics experience

00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:57,320
and that's a lot of why I'm here why I'm

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:59,720
still here right so I'm an executive at

00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:02,270
a company of 56 people they have this

00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,710
DTO hat on a lot of other people who

00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:06,740
have that hat on like they don't program

00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:09,110
that much every day anymore all blessed

00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,270
be with that like I would just go nuts

00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,730
if that was me right I need to program

00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:16,280
every week at the very least and I've

00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,350
been I've had just had two weeks in a

00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,060
row that's why I was into such a cheery

00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,280
mood when you you asked me about like

00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,840
hey how are things going right because

00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,760
for the last two weeks I have had

00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,010
basically nothing but Ruby programming

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:31,310
in my programming like four or five

00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:33,050
hours a day and it's just like I shot my

00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:36,700
computer at 5 p.m. and I just go out of

00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:40,040
my office with a goddamn smile on that

00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:43,009
smile is that why is that

00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:45,920
there is that just joy of the work and

00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:51,519
the joy of the impact and the jewelry of

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:54,199
kind of the the dance the aesthetics

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,820
everything that sort of hopefully we all

00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:57,769
love about Ruby although I just got into

00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,209
a tangle on Twitter the other day where

00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:00,980
some words like grow people who only

00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:04,910
care about program or aesthetics or

00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:07,720
something they're toxic that toxic I am

00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:11,000
I care so deeply about that and like

00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:13,430
that hasn't changed that much right like

00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,540
we continue to fiddle at it it's the

00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,399
same thing when I look at the evolution

00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,750
of Ruby you look at I just did it the

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,009
other day I was like oh I want to

00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,779
actually work at added in Ruby in the

00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:24,050
last few versions that I would sort of

00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:26,750
use and look like - seven - six - five -

00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:29,920
four you're like things aren't changing

00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:33,560
that radically because they're great

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:36,410
right like it reminds me of I think it

00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:38,480
was Johnny I who was remarking of

00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:39,680
something about like why some design for

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,259
either for a Mac or something hasn't

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,029
changed and he was like an apple we're

00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:45,199
not just looking to make change we're

00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:47,360
looking to make things better

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,430
right so I've really internalized that

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,170
since that like you can get to a certain

00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:53,329
point where if you don't have an idea

00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:55,100
for making it better the most likely

00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:56,930
thing you'll do is you'll it up

00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,880
by changing it right like you'll make it

00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:01,399
worse and there's so many things we keep

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,819
making were solvent on on this industry

00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:07,909
it's just sort of a group hug of amnesia

00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:10,520
work we go like we've learned all these

00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:13,520
things like it's funny obviously with

00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,990
Ruby when I got into that like I would

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,120
talk to people we're in small talk for

00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:19,250
example and there's like all the things

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,949
we have like the refactoring browser the

00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,120
lobby a place you only like it was lost

00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:27,230
through the ages and it still hasn't

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,000
been rediscovered no no like in some

00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:31,309
ways some of us Ruby folks are sitting

00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:40,130
in that camp shouting - the JavaScript

00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:42,320
people but the things we had yeah do you

00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:44,840
want the world hasn't changed that much

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,480
they're really the main thing when I

00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:50,240
look back over the 20 years of doing web

00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,730
apps the things that changed was the

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,660
iPhone that's pretty much what I could

00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,240
point to

00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:58,010
and like that was the big change for me

00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,450
that you really needed to tackle in a

00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,610
different way and what's that kind of

00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:04,970
ironic is that like that change has

00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:06,290
almost petered out to some extent

00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:08,480
because when the iPhone first was

00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:10,490
introduced it was like just a horribly

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,250
slow machine and you had to build web

00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:14,690
apps in a different way you couldn't do

00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,640
it in the same way since the CPU was

00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:19,280
just terrible right now I just

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,710
benchmarked my iPhone 11 Pro yesterday

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,100
you're just putting down like 160 on the

00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:26,780
speedometer or 200 which is compared to

00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,720
like I have an iMac Pro but like I don't

00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:32,510
know 12 course it does like 130

00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:35,180
my macbook a 16 it does like a hundred

00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:37,250
20 now the fastest computers we own for

00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:40,280
operating the web are our phones yeah

00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:43,340
and it's getting crazy like apple just

00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:47,810
released that the new iPhone what's it

00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:50,720
called I see a TSE right a3 $899 phone

00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:53,990
that has that chip that does 160 on this

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:57,950
diameter - oh just like right so in some

00:18:53,990 --> 00:19:00,050
ways like that mobile change is now more

00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,400
of a UI change it used to be a thing we

00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:04,600
needed to care about like when we built

00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:07,400
Basecamp - we built an entirely separate

00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,230
JavaScript model for the web views we

00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,240
needed on the phone because we couldn't

00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:15,950
run the real JavaScript it was just too

00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:17,150
slow this was 2013-14 right so like

00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,950
there's some convergence where things

00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:22,880
are getting sort of back and they're

00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:24,920
getting better so anyway on the tech

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,690
side I don't thinks have changed that

00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,760
much I think a lot of people think they

00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,900
have changed the law and that like now

00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,050
you have to do all these things now we

00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:34,970
have to have 15 people just to stand up

00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:38,630
a crud app because you've sliced it into

00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:41,390
all these different specialties and it's

00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:43,970
a blind alley and I think it's a

00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:46,160
terrible way to go and it's such a weird

00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:49,130
thing where we in the Ruby mirth

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,650
community like hey it all exploded mm I

00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:53,780
don't know five six people going oh wow

00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:55,670
this is new this is change this is

00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:58,490
different right and then we had sort of

00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:01,550
I don't know five years until JavaScript

00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:03,200
kind of got a second wind where everyone

00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:04,850
just internalized and adopted this idea

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,169
that like hate productivity is good

00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:07,369
having one developer

00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:09,350
being able to do a lot of progress is

00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:11,330
good and then we got to this point where

00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:13,789
like oh no now we have to make a basic

00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:22,070
thing yeah there'll be 15 developers and

00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:25,429
nine months what I think perhaps some

00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:27,859
what did happen was that Silicon Valley

00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:30,139
started slashing so much money

00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:32,509
around that it just didn't matter it

00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:35,480
just didn't matter whether your MVP

00:20:32,509 --> 00:20:36,679
needed 15 people plus tax right because

00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,169
you could just hire whatever right

00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:42,950
versus Ruby and rails and the whole

00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:44,869
ethos was born out of hey what can you

00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,850
do with one developer right like I built

00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:48,679
all of base camps myself I installed it

00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,970
under servers I operated it I did the

00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:51,649
whole thing I needed a toolkit that

00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:53,690
could do that right and we kept that

00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:55,039
ether that's going up until now and I

00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,899
think perhaps not this pendulum is gonna

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,850
swing back where someone goes like yeah

00:20:56,899 --> 00:21:00,409
I can't do the 15 developers and plus

00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:02,629
tax anymore right like we just don't

00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:06,499
have the money now things are anyway

00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:08,779
yeah I think that's great I mean I think

00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:10,730
that what you know one interest at on

00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:13,609
here that I added this morning out of my

00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:16,249
list was this interesting on this swing

00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:18,919
and and is you know I think that a

00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:22,249
couple of things I was thinking back on

00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:23,809
when you were trying at rubyconf in San

00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:25,700
Diego that time when you were trying to

00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:28,190
get rails one out and I just did I was

00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,619
thinking back on it being like if if you

00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:32,029
were to look at an app now that that DHH

00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:33,379
would look at an app now you'd be like

00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:35,419
yeah this looks basically the same like

00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:36,950
oh what's a concern there's been a few

00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:39,590
concepts in there but I look effectively

00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:41,029
the same so the other the other thing

00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,769
that's interesting is you know like we

00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:45,320
had that like sort of we're talking you

00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:47,600
you had mentioned like like the monolith

00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,450
the majestic monolith and I think it's

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:53,210
it's even it feels like even just the

00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:55,070
last few months we saw it we've all of a

00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:56,690
sudden we've seen again you know we had

00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:58,940
we had less than we saw the

00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,559
microservices and now we've like

00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:02,059
everybody's like hey you know let's just

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,129
go back to monolith again I feel like

00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:06,470
that has that zeitgeist has become again

00:22:04,129 --> 00:22:08,299
which is it's it's so interesting I feel

00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:10,249
like I feel like there's a lot of things

00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:12,139
that that you personally as well as

00:22:10,249 --> 00:22:14,119
rails have been like you know like kind

00:22:12,139 --> 00:22:16,130
of just the steady like I built a small

00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:17,570
sine wave and that the rest

00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:20,050
this tree has been the big sine wave and

00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:23,300
like it matches back up sometimes again

00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:25,310
yes yes so there's all these very

00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,350
interesting theories and I kind of like

00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:30,620
the historic dialectic and you swing

00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:32,780
back from theses and antis ec's and

00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:35,360
hypotheses and like back and forth and I

00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:36,830
think some of it is is not to get this

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,110
too political but I look at someone like

00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:41,780
Bernie Sanders right dudes been saying

00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:44,720
the same for 40 years no one gave a

00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:47,150
crap in like the 80s the 90s and then

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,150
all of the sudden like 2007 except

00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:53,150
simmering 2006 all sudden people show up

00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:55,520
hey that dude's got some points right

00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:57,890
think he's like no new points just you

00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,440
look at a clip from like 72 and you're

00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:02,360
like yeah I mean sloppy more hair

00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,330
perhaps like otherwise same dude same

00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:08,240
same right the pendulum swung to

00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:09,800
him and I think of the same way with

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,870
with rails he's like the pendulum keeps

00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,000
swinging you're never going to be in the

00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:17,090
sweet spot forever that's just not how

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,170
the world works right um so we were

00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:23,810
swung in in like 2006 - 2010 or whatever

00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:26,810
the page start swinging back we kept

00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:31,670
going right now depends on his back at

00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:33,740
end and relight yep still here yeah like

00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:35,510
all these questions you're rediscovering

00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:37,430
right like that and Misha is sometimes

00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:39,080
like it runs in cycles and that's partly

00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:40,910
why the pendulum keeps swinging I saw

00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,980
this thing about like the number of

00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:44,780
developers in the world doubles like

00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,790
every three years or something so just

00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:48,950
the influx of new boomba like the app

00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:51,530
age someone has spend in the industry is

00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:53,150
very short so that's the explanation for

00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,470
the omission in larger parts right like

00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:56,090
someone comes into the industry and they

00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:58,130
go like what's hot right now

00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:00,170
Ralph's used to be just a hot thing and

00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:01,760
that used to be the default now it's it

00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:04,010
was no longer the default and now to go

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,260
like oh react is the default right and

00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:08,360
then some point people sort of grow up

00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,370
through that and they go like yeah this

00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:13,250
kind of hurts I would have someone have

00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:15,500
some some some massage tools here that

00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:17,810
we can use can we stop some of this hurt

00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:20,810
like what does my neck crane like this

00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:22,460
yeah we've got like hey hey we're

00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:25,040
solving here it's still good and and I

00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,960
think that that's where weird things are

00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,600
coming back to and do you think with

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,280
that is if you were

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,960
investing your ego into like I want to

00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,000
be the hot and we always got to be

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,720
the hot like you're gonna have a

00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,549
bad time

00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,760
cuz nothing stays the hot forever

00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:43,549
yeah so for me personally like why am I

00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:46,280
still working on Ruby and rails after 17

00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:49,400
years because the hot was like a

00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:52,130
sideshow the mansion was what I just

00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,320
talked about that bliss of me getting to

00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:56,330
do Ruby on Rails for two weeks straight

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,610
walking out with the biggest grin on my

00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:00,620
face at five o'clock because I got to

00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:02,570
work in this amazing environment like

00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,890
that's the main attraction with the main

00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:05,270
attraction is your own intrinsic

00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:07,340
motivation yeah

00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:09,200
the other stuff can come and go yeah

00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,270
right same thing I said what's in theirs

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,789
like if he's saying the he actually

00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:16,580
believes right he's not trying to sort

00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:19,370
of a focus group his way into like what

00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:21,169
should the message be it's so much

00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:23,270
easier to stay consistent it's so much

00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:25,159
easier to stay in the game and I think

00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:27,650
that's the game we've we've stayed in

00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:30,620
and the other thing there too it's just

00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:32,059
like things just don't change that much

00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,130
we love to believe that they do

00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:36,919
oh man technology so fast no it's not

00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:38,570
like you look at the broad scheme of

00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:41,480
like what has happened in programming

00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:42,440
over the past 60 years there's these

00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,450
thirsty spliffs

00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,840
where should it happen right yeah but

00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:48,950
like get immediate when I look at

00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,470
functional programming is another great

00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:53,860
example program is few tries obviously

00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:55,880
but like it was also there before right

00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:57,350
stories its again it's sort of this

00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,450
initiative word we kind of just feel

00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:01,789
like to make our own lives interesting

00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:06,169
on a broad scale we can kind of have to

00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:07,549
run around in these circles sure so yeah

00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:09,669
that's actually a good that's another

00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:14,150
good a good segue into sort of like

00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:14,990
maybe a not a lighter topic necessary a

00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:17,000
little bit a slightly different topic

00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,650
which is you know like so you've yeah

00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,450
you've going in you're working on your

00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:22,580
stuff and like other other things that

00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,690
you look at like other technologies

00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,549
stuff that you would look at it'd be

00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:28,010
like yeah this is just like it sort of

00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:29,539
sort of secret to to to sate that crave

00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:31,340
in some way you'd be like oh maybe I

00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:34,610
want to go write assembly

00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:36,049
you know like 68k assembly today eyes or

00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:38,120
other things like that you know we had

00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:40,100
some questions about like crystal or

00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,780
truffle Ruby or

00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,800
typescript things like that are there

00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,970
things in there that

00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,610
necessarily have to be stuff that goes

00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:48,110
that go into into rails but something

00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:51,500
like maybe you like to dabble with you

00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:52,850
like to play with on at times yeah it's

00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:56,120
it's a good question because I think I'm

00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:57,710
a misnomer in that sense like I the way

00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,900
I approach a lot of things is when I

00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:01,730
don't know what to pick like I'm gonna

00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,770
try all the options and I try everything

00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:06,080
and I figure it all out and then at some

00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:07,790
point I'll reach my conclusion and those

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,360
conclusions can stay stable for a very

00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:11,270
long time

00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,670
I have not I have not found a better

00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:16,520
programming language than Ruby right and

00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:21,740
I've tried a fair a number of different

00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:23,510
things but I am so intensely enamored by

00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,790
what we have in Ruby and how that model

00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:27,770
works that the pool of a lot of other

00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:29,210
things is just not really there and a

00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:31,750
lot of the things that to me for example

00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:35,150
makes Ruby special is the fact that it's

00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:38,240
it's dynamically typed so typing for me

00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:41,000
is really I mean I'm allergic and I I

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,640
don't say that with mr. d-pryde because

00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,760
I do recognize the benefits you can get

00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,830
from static typing or invert typing in

00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,990
different ways but you know what I'm not

00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:53,240
willing to pay any of it like types trip

00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:56,000
is probably the closest where you can go

00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,040
there a number of people the JavaScript

00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,540
crew we have a base camp they're pretty

00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,880
fond of typescript

00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:04,190
I look at time script and like and like

00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,350
I'd rather not write like I'd rather not

00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:09,020
so we actually don't we use typescript

00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:10,310
to write some of our library code we

00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,170
don't use typescript to write our

00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:14,450
application code at base kick we still

00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:17,840
just JavaScript JavaScript I'd say

00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:20,660
modern JavaScript like es6 + is probably

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,790
closest where I go like know what this

00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:24,680
is a good time like I'm not having a bad

00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:26,960
time I used to have a bad time writing

00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:31,850
down today like doubts but very

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,300
intensely six-plus JavaScript not bad at

00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:34,490
all

00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:37,010
right and if some of that is like I just

00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:39,590
I'm an oil programmer right like you

00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:40,970
have these sort of leanings functional

00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:43,070
programming is great I like a bunch of

00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:46,790
it it has influenced my code style and

00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:48,590
Ruby is this wonderfully poly paradigm

00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:50,720
language where you can mix and match in

00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:53,330
such a great way but like my emphasis is

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,690
very much on the object-oriented side of

00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:59,500
things so in that sense like I'm not

00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:00,820
not like super interested in that and

00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,039
then I could some of these other things

00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:05,019
like crystal or other sorbet or these

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,809
other things that can add time to Ruby

00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:10,149
and I go like I love that we have such a

00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:14,409
big tent that people can play with that

00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:16,539
there's a way I'm gonna do it if

00:29:14,409 --> 00:29:18,639
it mats if you are listening do not put

00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:21,340
this into Ruby the Ruby we have right

00:29:18,639 --> 00:29:24,610
now and it's a relationship with typing

00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:27,129
is wonderful do not it up like I

00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:30,340
look at something like PHP and I go like

00:29:27,129 --> 00:29:33,279
I have fond memories of PHP the PHP I

00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,970
look at today no don't try to be

00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,990
something you're not

00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:39,009
like dirt there are an endless amount of

00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:40,629
environments and so on that already do

00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:44,019
these other things we don't need to turn

00:29:40,629 --> 00:29:46,750
Ruby into another version of that Ruby

00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:49,929
is beautifully unique for what it is and

00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:53,200
a core appeal of that what that is is

00:29:49,929 --> 00:29:54,639
the dynamic typing at least for me now

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,679
I've had some conversations with other

00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:58,059
teams like that seems to shopify their

00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:00,580
experiment with sorbet

00:29:58,059 --> 00:30:03,250
they have legitimately different

00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:05,580
concerns and like the kind of bugs that

00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:06,820
they see in production I go like huh

00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,860
okay

00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,000
that's fascinating I guess different

00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,679
things happen when you have a hundred

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,870
plus programmers working on a single

00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,169
codebase and like right like there you

00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:19,330
have different concerns and I fully

00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:22,360
accept the limitations of my preferences

00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:25,330
are born within like long-running code

00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:27,070
bases made by small teams of staple

00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:29,679
crews who work together for a long time

00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:31,629
you can do different things you need

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,700
different safeties on your knives right

00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:35,830
like yeah we can have the sharpest

00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,169
goddamn knives in the drawer that are

00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:40,269
really good and precise and like yeah

00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:42,100
they can't cut a finger off right that's

00:30:40,269 --> 00:30:43,750
the whole thing about the rope to hang

00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,429
yourself yeah you can use the rope to

00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:48,519
hang yourself or you can use it to climb

00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:50,289
up to a more beautiful vantage point we

00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:51,789
using that rope all the time to climb up

00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:53,350
to the beautiful vantage point and I'm

00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:54,549
not giving up a rope just

00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:56,080
because someone can use it to hang

00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:58,870
themselves with right the same thing

00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:01,840
with the knives so in that regard like

00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:04,419
yeah I'm I'm boring like that like I

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,159
really focused on finding the right

00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:07,419
thing and then once I do like I move on

00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,200
to other things like there are other

00:31:07,419 --> 00:31:10,940
things that then interest me finding

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:15,049
another programming language is not high

00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:17,149
on my list of sort of Abhi's sure it's a

00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:19,220
good one thing you mentioned that would

00:31:17,149 --> 00:31:21,860
be a good go sort of track to take is

00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:23,330
you know so in addition to to you know

00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,470
working out working on Basecamp for as

00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:27,620
long as you have you've basically been

00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:30,110
the the head the top of the rails open

00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:32,870
source project for for basically about

00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:34,750
that same length of time and so it would

00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:37,970
be interesting to hear sort of you know

00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:39,529
how that has your role with the larger

00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:41,690
project has evolved over time but also

00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:43,399
like kind of what you look for in people

00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:45,440
who work on the project I mean the core

00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:47,990
team if people who come and go from the

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,139
core team over time and and you know in

00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:53,179
some ways the core team you know sort of

00:31:51,139 --> 00:31:55,909
some of the the things that you is that

00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:57,289
you espouse today sort of map towards

00:31:55,909 --> 00:31:59,149
things you look for and people who are

00:31:57,289 --> 00:32:02,000
on the rails core team as well so anyway

00:31:59,149 --> 00:32:04,039
so so yeah I'll let you talk about that

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,320
yeah note that that that's great because

00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:07,970
it told you did change a lot like when I

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,830
started working on rails or when I

00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:14,149
started extracting rails in 2003

00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:15,860
obviously I wrote it all myself because

00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:18,889
that was what it is was right and then

00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:21,649
for about a year after it was made

00:32:18,889 --> 00:32:24,169
public I just took patches I still

00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:27,950
committed everything myself these days I

00:32:24,169 --> 00:32:29,120
write the minority of rails directly

00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:32,510
myself by my own hands

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:34,820
like I am the role that I play now is

00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:37,330
more like the biggest fan the biggest

00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:41,960
user right like I care

00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:44,090
extremely deeply about um like how it

00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,860
feels to use it I cared a little less

00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:47,779
about like necessarily how its

00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:50,570
implemented like if you asked me how is

00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:53,090
the active record fallacious model set

00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:55,130
up and implement I couldn't tell you off

00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:56,539
the top of my head or like how's the

00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:58,820
view up to my stations how do we do

00:32:56,539 --> 00:33:00,710
caching for templates and so on I have

00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,880
this fuzzy rough at the end I could look

00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,590
it up I could probably follow the code

00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,409
but I can't reciting it I can't write it

00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:08,269
on the whiteboard and that has changed

00:33:06,409 --> 00:33:10,519
because we've just got such an influx of

00:33:08,269 --> 00:33:13,070
people who care very deeply about very

00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:14,659
specific things and I golike wonderful

00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:17,029
now I don't have to care about that

00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:20,240
anymore right there's someone who now

00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:22,549
knows the the depth of the relation in

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,970
inactive record and I can go wonderful

00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:25,340
do you know

00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:26,870
I'm just gonna park that out of my

00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,250
brain like I'm gonna I'm gonna pour it

00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,630
out actually like I'm gonna just go

00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:31,159
facing down my head and just gonna flow

00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,640
up and then I could fill in some new

00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:33,380


00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:35,240
got a villains and stuff and I can let

00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,640
that play around and then we'll have

00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,380
someone else with lines up to to kind of

00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:43,010
do that and I think that that to me was

00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:45,380
always my my hope for rails that we

00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:47,720
would have people who individually cared

00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:50,480
about different things and then we'd all

00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:52,490
come together and we'd go like hey this

00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,799
is better I can share my part like hey I

00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:56,000
care a lot about API design let me do

00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,760
some designs here I care a lot about

00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,610
extracting new frameworks everything

00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:03,919
from action mailbox to active storage

00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:05,270
all these things come from me using the

00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,470
framework and go like you know what I

00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,610
don't want this in my app this

00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:09,440
should be in the framework such that I

00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:12,710
have it next time I do another app um

00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,879
and and so I do that and then we have

00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:17,240
all these other people show up with all

00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:18,830
the other stuff I think the experience

00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:21,500
with merb which was this sort of

00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:23,419
alternative framework that was doing a

00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:26,540
lot of the similar things to Rails back

00:34:23,419 --> 00:34:29,240
in 2000 I think nine eight um but from a

00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:30,679
different care like the people who are

00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,520
working on the care about some different

00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:33,530
things

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,639
Ashwin Yehuda like there was a lot of

00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:37,040
things about performance and

00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:39,080
extensibility and so on and we thought

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,520
in the beginning like well I don't know

00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:43,220
if I ever thought but there was a

00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,629
misconception that like well it's rails

00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,830
doesn't want these things they don't

00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:48,770
care about speed they don't care about

00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:51,589
existence extensibility and I was like

00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:53,720
no I just don't it's not that I don't

00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:55,399
care it's just not that's not my focus

00:34:53,720 --> 00:35:00,500
right like that's not the main thing I

00:34:55,399 --> 00:35:02,570
want to do so you can do it if you want

00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,880
to do it like wonderful come please come

00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:07,609
on come in here right we have right now

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,440
in the rails group a lot is we have a

00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:12,410
bunch of people who care about different

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,240
things like Aaron and Eileen have worked

00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:17,060
a bunch of on performance stuff they

00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:20,900
have worked on making active record work

00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:22,670
better at get up and then we have a

00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:25,550
bunch of people also like it from Java

00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:27,500
and so on that kind of bring all that

00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:28,880
stuff in and we go like hey this is

00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:32,810
great we're sitting at this big table

00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:34,270
and we're sharing all the plates yeah so

00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:35,950
that is really that has

00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:38,110
in the philosophy I think it's been like

00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:42,100
that for a long time and I think that

00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:43,780
that's the the most successful or

00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:45,580
easiest path to get on the core team

00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:50,680
it's just start caring about something

00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:52,570
that no one else while and like show up

00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,980
with the work and go like hey here's a

00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:56,830
bunch of stuff that I care about and I

00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:59,920
made better do you like it and like we

00:35:56,830 --> 00:36:01,900
all go yes yeah I think that's that's

00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,700
super great to hear I love the idea of

00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:05,620
thinking about you as just like the

00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,690
superfan right like this the person

00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:08,980
who's like hey like like hey I like you

00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:11,050
know I have an opinion about this

00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,460
because I want it to like it works the

00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:14,680
way that I like to work so let's maybe

00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:16,570
not change it because like I I want it

00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:19,210
to work that way right I love that idea

00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:21,550
that you you're sort of like the the

00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:23,350
person who arrives at the amusement park

00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:24,940
and it's like what new rides are there

00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:26,230
today like dope but don't take now I

00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:28,060
love these old ones don't take the old

00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:29,830
ones down I do but what new rides are we

00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,410
gonna do today right it's and it's not

00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:33,490
like I'm building all the rides myself

00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:37,750
no totally and I think that has changed

00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:39,910
like I've gone a lot where I'll put on

00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:41,620
like it an idea of like how I I'd like

00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:43,360
to see something work and like I'll just

00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:45,250
open a pull request like I'm kind of

00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,900
using the executive privilege there

00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:48,790
right like normally we don't use pull

00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,980
requests for future requests but I'm

00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:52,120
like I I really want this thing is to

00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:55,780
someone who's interested in doing that

00:36:52,120 --> 00:37:00,600
and I'll pop it on there and another

00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:03,220
tactic I often use which I found very

00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:05,500
rewarding is I'll make a really shitty

00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:09,130
version of what I want and then I'll put

00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:10,960
it up there programmers love to do it's

00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:12,820
point out shitty code right like they're

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,800
like well here's the thing that's kind

00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:18,490
of shooting like I can make it better

00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,710
right I think I'm I'm good at not

00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:22,840
feeling embarrassed about shitty code

00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:24,760
like I'll ride some shitty code actually

00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,620
usually it's not necessary to code as

00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,910
shitty it because I do care about making

00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:31,510
it nice but it's like it's very

00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:33,280
incomplete sure or it's slow or it's all

00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:35,080
these other things right you put it out

00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,390
in the open and like a bunch of people

00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:39,250
show up and they they want to help they

00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:42,640
want to make it they want to make it

00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:44,980
make it better so I I pulled back more

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,380
and more like the drafts that I share

00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,980
now they're so rough right like

00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:50,650
I remember

00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:51,970
when when when we first published when I

00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:54,550
first published when we announced like I

00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:56,500
pored over it to light the point of

00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:58,240
perfection partly I could because I

00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:00,850
think the first version of rails was

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,700
literally a thousand lines of code

00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:06,640
I read those thousand lines of code I

00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,960
mean hundreds of times changing

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,670
everything and making it perfect right

00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,840
now where else is not a thousand lines

00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:12,580
of code I don't even know how many lines

00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:16,210
of code it is but it's a lot right it

00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:18,040
does a lot and I've just gone like hey I

00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,480
let me just make the rough draft let's

00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,100
get someone else involved look let's

00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,710
work together with someone else and then

00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:26,500
we can move forward with it nerd Snipes

00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:32,280
so you just love to like go out there do

00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:32,280
a little nerd tonight like sort of does

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,010
to go exactly like perfect can you just

00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:38,020
do it for me then right

00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:42,119
I'm very acceptable to those as my

00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:45,550
co-workers will tell me as well so yes

00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:47,590
it's a honeypot yeah exactly

00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:49,510
you know it's thinking about like just

00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:52,510
the evolution of rails as well you know

00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:54,310
are there things if you look back on the

00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:56,380
things that you've that you've added and

00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:58,090
taken away or things that like patterns

00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:00,460
maybe that don't work as well as they

00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:02,440
used to I think that like even one of

00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:04,210
the questions that somebody had was like

00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,220
you know what are we doing with asset

00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:08,380
pipelines and how that has migrated or

00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:10,660
changed over time and I think I added in

00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:13,750
here like do we still do you still use

00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:17,170
table polymorphism and stuff like that

00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:19,150
like other just like it doesn't you know

00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:21,130
it's just like this was good for now and

00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:24,190
now maybe don't use it anymore that kind

00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:28,600
of stuff yeah I think that's that's good

00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:31,119
I think with the asset pipeline we ended

00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:35,290
up building or building essentially like

00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:38,050
the transpiler approach that has taken

00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:40,480
off immensely in JavaScript before the

00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:42,640
Java community was really easy that

00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,950
interested in working on it right and

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,290
now they are and now there's a bunch of

00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:49,030
great tooling for it it doesn't mix it

00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:51,220
relson have to do that anymore right

00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:52,660
right so we could pull back and go like

00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:55,869
you know what the asset pipeline doesn't

00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:59,080
need to be in the forefront of the

00:39:55,869 --> 00:40:00,609
JavaScript development now it's funny

00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,430
though because they look like well why

00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:04,040
don't you

00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:06,020
shift completely assisted all assets

00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,610
have run through that CSS and everything

00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,710
else goes through it and I'm like

00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:12,470
because it's not better like have you

00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:15,590
tried actually including CSS in webpack

00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:17,060
 no it's not a nice experience it's

00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:19,460
not great it's not better than what we

00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:22,250
have so I'm in that regard I'm very much

00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:24,380
like Ruby with the poly paradigm

00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:26,390
approach like I'm a poly solution

00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:28,190
approach like hey let's keep the asset

00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:31,820
pipeline in place to do things like

00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:34,010
copying images and dealing with with CSS

00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:37,790
as long as it does that better in a

00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:40,820
nicer way to use than the alternatives

00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:43,010
um I like what act for what it does for

00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:44,300
JavaScript we don't really tinker with

00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:46,540
it I think we use something that's

00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:49,520
pretty close to the standard web Packer

00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:51,590
contract it does that great wonderful

00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,330
and then we use the asset pipeline for

00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:55,180
CSS and the combination of these two

00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:57,680
things it's great like I don't have

00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:59,510
there's a lot of people in in in

00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,820
programming who have a very pure

00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:03,050
approach right like I think that's part

00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:05,690
of the appeal of JavaScript is like I

00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:07,370
can use the one language for both the

00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:09,560
the back end in the front and Erlich

00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:10,970
that means a lot to me and I golike that

00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:15,380
means nothing to me

00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:17,900
nothing I don't give a in fact it's

00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:22,910
even more militant than that I think

00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:24,470
it's bad there's a good group who've

00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:26,900
been working on making essentially a

00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:29,120
ruby to JavaScript transpiler and like

00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,530
I've heard a lot of pitches for it and

00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,810
they're like but it's Ruby and like

00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:34,670
isn't that better and I'm like no like

00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:36,440
JavaScript is great for what JavaScript

00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:37,790
does why do I like I don't have this

00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:41,180
idea of just like there's the one

00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:42,950
approach to everything the same thing

00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:45,800
that goes all the way back to thinking

00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:47,360
like sequel is not a bad language active

00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,190
record has never taken the approach that

00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:52,220
like sequel is this sort of demon that

00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:53,720
needs to be exorcised we've reduced the

00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:56,720
amount of sequel you need to write on a

00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:58,520
regular basis it's I don't write a lot

00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,080
of sequel we used to write more because

00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,790
active record didn't do as much but it's

00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,310
not from this perspective of like we

00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:06,380
have to eradicate it um we do to

00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:09,320
compress the the conceptual compression

00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:11,980
but when I look at something like Ruby

00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:14,360
to JavaScript transpiling

00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:14,840
limited amounts of conceptual

00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,250
compression

00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:18,290
because you still have to understand the

00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:22,430
model of what it outputs into and like

00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:24,260
it just it's not from so there's that

00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:25,730
and there's something else which which

00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:27,620
is sort of funny since we just talked

00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:29,510
about micro services um and I think

00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:34,870
about like 2007 we had a framework

00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:37,310
called active resource it was a

00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:39,410
service-oriented approach like hey make

00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:42,440
a bunch of apps tie them together you

00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:44,420
can talk to the boys boom right and like

00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,220
I used that framework and we built a

00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:49,840
bunch of things on him and it's in those

00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:52,580
scars that I draw the fierce opposition

00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:54,770
to micro services and service-oriented

00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:56,180
architectures in general right cuz I ran

00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:57,740
that and it sucked

00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:00,560
and you know why it hasn't gotten

00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:02,780
materially better this idea that like we

00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:06,980
replaced a method call or a sequel query

00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:08,390
with an HTTP call no as far as we

00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:10,670
can avoid it it doesn't mean always

00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:13,340
right like there are times where we're

00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:15,410
it makes sense I think just the times

00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:17,900
that it makes sense it's like 1% of the

00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:21,020
time compared to sort of this

00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:24,590
infatuation we've endured over the past

00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:28,040
like 5 plus which is so funny because it

00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:30,080
was in sort of version 100 of those well

00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:32,090
not even 100 200 perhaps you could think

00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:34,010
Corbett before this but like it was in a

00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:37,430
past version of this same battle that

00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:41,470
rails was born the ws Death Star was

00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:44,600
literally the first kind of big

00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:46,520
ideological battle that rails picked up

00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,280
the other side off like you have WS

00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:50,570
start which was this whole

00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:55,760
service-oriented thing remember well

00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:59,420
yeah terrible sort of approach to it

00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:02,090
right it was j2ee was a local and remote

00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:04,280
dude javabeans it was all the same

00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:06,500
right and you go like all the bad ideas

00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,600
all the zombie ideas of suffer at the

00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:10,760
moment they're on the same trip Mel has

00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:12,920
the good ideas and they come in bulk

00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:15,800
just as frequently as the good hitches

00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:19,490
come back in boat and we go like no

00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:21,020
I mean yeah this is it's just it's

00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,760
interesting to have been through a full

00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:24,350
clock cycle of that right like I am see

00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,670
I got started with Ruby on Rails I

00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:26,980
hadn't gone through any of the clock

00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:29,079
cycles I just been on the first

00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:31,060
now I've been a couple of two loops and

00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:33,190
you just go like yeah it just does

00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:34,869
repeat but anyway active resource was

00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:36,579
the thing that they said she was like

00:44:34,869 --> 00:44:38,440
well maybe there's an okay way of doing

00:44:36,579 --> 00:44:44,290
services oriented architectures and

00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:47,200
conclusion was no like don't pretend

00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:48,820
that what happens over the network is

00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,800
the same as what happens locally like

00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:52,930
that's one of the immutable laws of

00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,630
distributed computing well law number

00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:58,660
one is don't do it yeah Lana two is if

00:44:55,630 --> 00:45:01,150
you do do it don't pretend that a method

00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:03,579
call is the same as a service invocation

00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:05,380
they're just doing different timescales

00:45:03,579 --> 00:45:06,520
and they should actually feel different

00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:08,530
that's the other thing of this

00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:10,359
transpiling making it all be the same

00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:11,109
language that I don't like like

00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:13,660
different things have different

00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:16,089
pressures like when I'm calling a remote

00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:19,000
object um it shouldn't have the same

00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:22,300
taste as calling local it should look

00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,820
foreign we preferably should even look

00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:27,400
bad right yeah this is what the idea of

00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:28,990
syntactic vinegar comes from the things

00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:34,720
you shouldn't do too often they should

00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:37,030
look annoying and bad mmhmm yeah III you

00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,280
know those those days of trying to make

00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:40,750
soap feel like it's just the thing that

00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,480
you call over the network it's like we

00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:45,790
look like yeah I mean yeah well I think

00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:47,380
it's what's funny is I don't I don't

00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:49,540
think it takes either of our opinions to

00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:51,190
say that it that it didn't work because

00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:53,680
if you look around like no one writes

00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:57,069
soap apps now like every single soap app

00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:58,660
is Allah is is like the far legacy ones

00:45:57,069 --> 00:46:00,579
and I would say there are probably more

00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:06,910
COBOL apps and there are some apps at

00:46:00,579 --> 00:46:08,680
this point in time so yes and I think

00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:10,150
they say it's going to be true for micro

00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:13,930
services people are going to look back

00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:15,760
and like I don't even the funny thing

00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:17,890
about my use of the micro services is

00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,990
like I don't even always know when where

00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:23,079
the limit is between sarcasm and comedy

00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:25,900
and reality like I think I saw a

00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:28,359
write-up were had like thousands of

00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:30,130
microchips yes I'm not sure that's an

00:46:28,359 --> 00:46:32,020
actual maybe that's an overstatement is

00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:36,339
that no no that was that was legit what

00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:38,440
that thing said so okay like that's a

00:46:36,339 --> 00:46:40,030
thing that like people are going to find

00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,980
like in the ground

00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:47,050
like 20 years from now like excavating

00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:49,090
things and you're like what what yeah

00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:52,420
yeah I think that article also talked

00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:54,790
about uber starting to do macro services

00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:56,290
to which a bunch of us said like I I

00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:57,880
think we already had a name for those

00:46:56,290 --> 00:47:02,020
but anyway that's a different

00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:03,940
conversation so um I think you know this

00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:06,570
has been great I think we're kind of

00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:07,930
we're getting towards the end here I

00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:12,460
guess I have to

00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:13,660
maybe maybe quickish ones one was you

00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:15,160
know so we've got some you were trying

00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:17,470
we were talking about sorbet earlier and

00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:19,240
sort of typing and stuff like that we

00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:20,950
had some questions about like for

00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:23,740
matters like syntax for manners and

00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:25,660
stuff like that right yeah I want to

00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,800
know like Oh would you are is that

00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:28,270
something that you'd be in favor of I

00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:31,090
mean like Ruby's never really had that

00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:32,890
and so it's sort of becoming more thing

00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:36,400
in various programming languages maybe

00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:37,870
give your quick thoughts on that yeah

00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,250
first I'm gonna say I do not have quick

00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:45,160
thoughts and that I only have one okay I

00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:47,170
have such a twisted tormented

00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:50,110
relationship with linters and formatters

00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:55,090
in general and if there's one thing I

00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:57,190
swear sort of at most in Ruby it's

00:47:55,090 --> 00:48:00,270
probably a group okok like we run

00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:03,430
Robocop and at base camp with an

00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:05,800
extremely limited set of rules right

00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:08,080
like it's nothing like the default thing

00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:11,470
but even the extremely limited set of

00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:14,020
rules has me swearing at the computer

00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:15,550
like almost nothing else that I can

00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:18,100
imagine and I'm at the point where I'm

00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:20,260
like I understand some of the benefits

00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:23,490
but I don't actually think they're worth

00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:26,620
it like I'm more on the side that like

00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:30,430
the amount of things I'm willing to let

00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:32,890
a format or lecture me about can fit on

00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:35,470
a dime like you can tell me

00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:37,720
about some spacing maybe at the end of

00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:40,780
the thing start telling me about like

00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:43,180
how I line up my things or where I use

00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:43,990
parentheses or whatever and you're in

00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:48,940
for a fight

00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:51,859
in fact Ruby to me so much of the

00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:55,789
enjoyment in Ruby is these

00:48:51,859 --> 00:48:57,410
credible subtleties of how many

00:48:55,789 --> 00:49:00,319
different ways you construct our

00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:02,450
conditional right like root has I don't

00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:04,190
know even the count there's got to be 60

00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:07,039
different ways you can say if something

00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:10,039
right and it is in those 60 different

00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:13,369
ways that I find half the enjoyment of

00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:15,109
writing Ruby like it was one of those

00:49:13,369 --> 00:49:17,900
things where I knew very early on that

00:49:15,109 --> 00:49:20,690
Python was not a language for me because

00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:23,150
it's set right in the manifesto there

00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:25,180
should be preferably one and only one

00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:29,869
way to do things

00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:32,119
Ruby has the exact opposite approach

00:49:29,869 --> 00:49:34,460
there should be preferably ten thousand

00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:37,039
some different ways of doing things that

00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:40,700
will allow you to write just that

00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:42,529
particular conditional with just the

00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:44,480
right emphasis do you run it in the

00:49:42,529 --> 00:49:46,369
front do you put it at the back is it

00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,369
multi-line is a single line like there's

00:49:46,369 --> 00:49:52,970
just so much variety and it's that

00:49:49,369 --> 00:49:55,549
variety that I find poetry and it is the

00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:57,769
poetry of writing Ruby code of making

00:49:55,549 --> 00:49:59,450
those subtle distinctions we're at the

00:49:57,769 --> 00:50:02,769
end you can like should we move it

00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:04,999
around like where I just go like right

00:50:02,769 --> 00:50:07,309
like we talked about that big smile

00:50:04,999 --> 00:50:09,559
right yeah so much that big smile comes

00:50:07,309 --> 00:50:13,730
from not just like solving the problem

00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:18,289
but solving it in a poetic way and this

00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:21,259
is where it is funny like for me Ruby is

00:50:18,289 --> 00:50:22,999
is almost like the Turing test by the

00:50:21,259 --> 00:50:25,730
time you can write a formatter

00:50:22,999 --> 00:50:27,200
that can accurately appreciate all these

00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:27,859
subtleties like we're gonna have

00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:36,170
general-purpose

00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:39,799
AI because all that intricacy is really

00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:41,960
difficult it really is and it's funny

00:50:39,799 --> 00:50:43,309
it's where I know that this is

00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,599
particularly of our Ruby it's like I

00:50:43,309 --> 00:50:46,910
don't quite feel the same thing about

00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:49,789
JavaScript we you also use a formatter

00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:51,410
in JavaScript and JavaScript is just

00:50:49,789 --> 00:50:53,029
more constrained like it doesn't have as

00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:54,380
much of this salty there are ten

00:50:53,029 --> 00:50:56,390
thousand different ways of writing a

00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:57,920
conditional and sometimes that often

00:50:56,390 --> 00:51:00,140
bothers me right but you have these

00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,940
service or constraint but I think also

00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,380
goes for the route right the thing the

00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:05,060
one most people point to is the one from

00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:06,290
go right like I think perhaps that

00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,790
the one that kind of like started it

00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:09,860
we're hoping maybe you would win again

00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:13,700
boom we're gonna have a 4-minute yeah go

00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:15,890
is a new speed kind of language

00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,540
right now they try to reduce the scope

00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:19,400
of the whole thing down to like it could

00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:20,780
just be like five words that we say

00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,460
different ways and like it has to build

00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:24,920
everything down of the tiniest box I got

00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:26,960
build everything up yourself Ruby is is

00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:29,210
English in the sense of like there's

00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:31,370
 ten thousand different adjectives

00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:33,410
that means just a sub difference slices

00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:34,880
of yeah it's like the joke of I don't

00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:39,470
even know if this true but I remember

00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:41,480
hearing that like I'm in new ink or I

00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:42,620
forget what the the language of

00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:45,020
Greenland is called but there's like

00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:49,460
there's like 13 different words for snow

00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:50,960
yeah right right this is and this is

00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:53,420
beautiful right look this is not an

00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,940
error like that link which would be so

00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:59,420
much worse off if it had just one word

00:51:55,940 --> 00:52:01,700
for snow right Ruby would be Ruby

00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:03,140
Woodstock if there was a format that

00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:08,020
said there's one way you could say if

00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:11,830
something might stop writing Ruby so

00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:14,450
yeah not a big fan very much hope that

00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:16,640
it doesn't get included in the official

00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:19,040
language in any way because the other

00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:23,060
thing too is Ruby has dialects

00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:25,300
yeah this is this is like a cultural

00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:27,740
treasure there's like Seattle style

00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:29,750
there's like I remember when I first

00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:31,670
read the the Ruby standard library and I

00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:33,590
could see all the dialects in all the

00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:35,270
different libraries in like poop I went

00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:36,500
like here's what I like here's what I

00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:38,840
don't like and they taught my own

00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:40,310
dialect right right could you write in

00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:43,940
your own dialect in terms of what Ruby

00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:46,490
you wanted active support is the rails

00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:48,680
dialect of Ruby and allowing you to have

00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:51,680
my own dialect and control over it it's

00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:53,600
just spectacular and like

00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,430
there's so much enjoyment out of that

00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:58,040
and there's I have such deep

00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:59,660
appreciation for that that like it's one

00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,890
of those things to were we talked about

00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:03,050
okay hey what do you like what do you

00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:04,940
know like you don't always know up front

00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:07,520
like what turns out to be significant

00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:09,740
the fact that Ruby is so expressive and

00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:12,620
has sixty different ways of saying if if

00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:14,090
that is one of those things where like

00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:15,680
in the beginning maybe you didn't bring

00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:17,960
so much thought into it but now you see

00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:21,079
the blossoming of culture that comes for

00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:25,520
decision and you go like do not

00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:29,780
with it right it comes it's actually

00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:32,240
it's the one way I try to very much

00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:34,880
restrict my commentary on what goes into

00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:36,470
Ruby core because a to me almost all of

00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:39,079
it is optional I could just choose not

00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:40,760
to do it and B it's optional in the ways

00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:42,109
where if I have a better way I can just

00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,839
put an active support and I do it all

00:53:42,109 --> 00:53:46,730
the time

00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:49,670
for example the new underscore one we

00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:51,230
have for implicit yields in the box it's

00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:53,960
one of those things where I like you

00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:54,349
know what I wish that wasn't that didn't

00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:57,109
happen

00:53:54,349 --> 00:54:00,410
and I can imagine a formatter

00:53:57,109 --> 00:54:02,150
going like you're yielding a name

00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:18,589
variable here let's replace that with

00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:20,690
underscore one and me just know I have a

00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:23,299
very torment nation ship with for

00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:25,880
matters and I'm Eric rutting Lee used

00:54:23,299 --> 00:54:28,309
them and in fact if anything I think

00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:30,589
whatever formatting rules should be they

00:54:28,309 --> 00:54:33,369
should be far more constrained like I

00:54:30,589 --> 00:54:35,630
like the one up that of course or that

00:54:33,369 --> 00:54:37,730
pulls me back from the temptation are

00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:39,740
using single quotes versus double quotes

00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:42,530
like I finally after fifteen years

00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:44,030
Ruby I came to the realization that

00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:45,380
trying to do the self distinction

00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:47,930
between single quotes and double quotes

00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:50,540
was not worth anyone's time and even I

00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:53,240
kept getting it wrong so I committed to

00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:58,010
just always using double quotes young I

00:54:53,240 --> 00:55:01,099
think that the the subtlest a form of

00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:03,650
formatting of linting then yeah well

00:55:01,099 --> 00:55:06,740
this has been great thank you so much

00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:08,990
for your time for doing this I hope that

00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:12,559
everything's going well at home and your

00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:14,329
everybody staying safe and sane and I'm

00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:18,290
hoping that I'll get to see you again in

00:55:14,329 --> 00:55:22,430
person soon and yeah any any anything

00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:24,170
you want to perper a some kind of

00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:28,910
podcast anything you'd like to promote

00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:32,359
here at the end well the funny thing is

00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:34,670
is that it's like I'm kind of like an

00:55:32,359 --> 00:55:36,200
involuntary promoter like an involved

00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:37,640
term marketer I just can't help it

00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:40,490
because I just get excited about the

00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:42,589
things that I work on right yeah I work

00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:43,910
on them I keep telling myself this every

00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:45,980
day when I get up like do you know what

00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:48,710
if you don't want to go to work you

00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:49,579
don't have to right and I tell myself

00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:52,730
that every day

00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:54,200
because it ensures that when I show up

00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:55,970
to work I work on the things I want to

00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,650
work on because why the else would

00:55:55,970 --> 00:56:01,190
I do it at this point it's like I don't

00:55:57,650 --> 00:56:02,630
have to right so that did that it kind

00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:05,510
of means that I end up working on things

00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:07,190
I'm really interested in because I could

00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:07,400
just totally not do any of this

00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:08,839


00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,490
right so the things I'm really

00:56:08,839 --> 00:56:13,819
interested in right now is obviously hey

00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:16,220
it's our new email service and email

00:56:13,819 --> 00:56:21,460
client baked into one thing it's hgy

00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:25,099
calm it's where I'm doing all my work

00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:27,950
research extractions for for new things

00:56:25,099 --> 00:56:30,589
in rails like whenever anyone sees like

00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:32,150
my byline in in the change locks it's

00:56:30,589 --> 00:56:33,740
always because I'm working on the next

00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:37,730
product or something else like that and

00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:39,710
I'm just up I never just sit Sunday

00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:41,839
morning let me put some new features

00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:44,000
into rails right yeah that's not a thing

00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:45,680
that happens it is like really excited

00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,750
about working here right now yes start

00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:53,150
working and then I go like hey to make

00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:54,950
hey ha to make a I rails should do this

00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:56,839
for me right like why am i the verdict

00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:58,430
is into my application code BAM

00:56:56,839 --> 00:57:00,020
yank it out put it in like that's how we

00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:02,869
actually already ended up with two

00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:04,339
frameworks action mailbox and active

00:57:02,869 --> 00:57:05,839
storage both of those things were

00:57:04,339 --> 00:57:07,250
extracted because I wanted to do with

00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:09,500
hey and we have that code in Basecamp

00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:10,970
and we haven't extracted it like I'm not

00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,990
 pulling that over another

00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:14,809
copy/paste

00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:17,780
yeah sorry so let's just put it back in

00:57:14,809 --> 00:57:21,260
so yeah hates it um we're gonna push it

00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:22,940
out hopefully I don't know I don't this

00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:23,540
summer maybe let's see where the world

00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,820
goes

00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:27,950
we were gonna put it out and say now I

00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:30,560
was and then I was gonna go talk about

00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:32,030
it that at railsconf but like hey I'll

00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:35,120
come soon enough and we'll pull these

00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:37,010
things out and I hope that this pendulum

00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:39,200
that's swinging back on the majestic

00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:42,980
monolith there's another pendulum that

00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:44,630
also swings back on api's and on how to

00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:45,830
do the front end and the pendulum is

00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:49,310
gonna kind of back and we're

00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:50,930

00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:53,240
bunch of other that gives a

00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:57,350
complete cohesive story on it I even

00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:59,060
have a sassy new name for it that we're

00:57:57,350 --> 00:58:01,910
gonna we're gonna put together such a

00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:04,760
whole unified theory of how to build

00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:07,160
