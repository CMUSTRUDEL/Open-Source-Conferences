[Applause]

00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,880
[Music]

00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,230
[Applause]

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,570
[Music]

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:18,720
[Applause]

00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:21,450
all right the future of web animation so

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,490
usually I get up here and I do a bunch

00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,930
of things where I try to make performant

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,029
animations in the browser and give you

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,430
tips on how to work with performant

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,619
animations but it's gotten a little bit

00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,450
boring I have so many videos like that

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,530
out there in the world so if you want to

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,630
see something like that

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,940
then go watch one of those but today

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,070
today we're gonna take things a step

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,350
further we're gonna talk about the

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,360
future of web animation and what might

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,400
be possible in the future we're gonna

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,590
start with some things that you can

00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,840
already do today so things that are like

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,270
kind of cutting edge things that you are

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,250
maybe experimental things that you can

00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,110
try and apps now that many people

00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,880
haven't tried yet and then we're gonna

00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:02,610
take it a step further so it's gonna be

00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,409
kind of exciting so before we talk about

00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,270
the future of the web the first thing

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,150
that we need to deal with and talk about

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:12,270
is the goal of the web the web is first

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,490
and foremost about communicating we can

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,220
communicate happiness we sure can share

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,619
stories and memes we can talk about fear

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,630
and talk about politics but really what

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:24,840
we're trying to do the main goal of the

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,159
web is to communicate with each other so

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,259
what does this have to have to do with

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,259
animation well I want you to think back

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,119
to your earliest sensory memories I want

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,829
I want you to think back to the first

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,079
time that media not something in your

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:40,259
lives but something like media made you

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:44,039
feel any one of these things happiness

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:47,219
sadness fear curiosity could it have

00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:51,049
been spirited away maybe it was you know

00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:53,159
up maybe it was toy story or wall-e

00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:56,030
how about something that makes you feel

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,030
all of them

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,020
[Music]

00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:32,660
[Music]

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:32,740
well that's very nice come here you

00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:37,650
[Laughter]

00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:37,650
[Music]

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:58,590
nothing's coming out of the closet to

00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:58,590
scare you anymore yeah goodbye

00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,430
kitty has to go

00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,560
sadness

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,400
curiosity

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,209
so the reason we talk about these things

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:03,060
and the reason why it's so exciting to

00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:07,670
us and the reason why let me get my

00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,670
mouth again the reason why

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:26,050
the reason why it was then so exciting

00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,210
to me and is still so exciting to me now

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,040
is that anything can happen you see

00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,470
emotions attached to the limbic system

00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,810
making things easier to recall if I

00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,250
asked you what happened to you what some

00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,810
day when you were five years old you

00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,940
might not remember what happened that

00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,889
day but you might actually remember all

00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:45,010
the words to Hakuna Matata or under the

00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:46,690
sea these cartoons may have seemed like

00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,520
just basic line drawings and

00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,680
entertainment but they gave color and

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,380
shape to our imaginations and brought

00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,240
life to our internal worlds part of the

00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,700
reason we could do this what was then

00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,520
exciting and is still so exciting to me

00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:02,560
is that anything can happen and that's

00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,360
why when we talk about the future of the

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,240
web in the future of what's possible on

00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,190
the web we talk about animation I'm

00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,070
Sarah Dresner I'm known as on Twitter as

00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:14,620
Sarah IDO as mentioned I write for CSS

00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:16,810
tricks I'm also head of developer

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:21,010
experience at nullify nullify as neither

00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:23,440
Netflix or Shopify even though that

00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:25,000
really confuses my parents but what it

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,220
is is super awesome and that's why I

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,889
really wanted to go work there and reach

00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:32,020
out to them so I'm here today to talk

00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:33,490
about the web's bright future we're

00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,080
gonna start with what's available to you

00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,210
today and then we're gonna push the

00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,789
boundaries even further with the goals

00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:41,919
for the future so let's first talk about

00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:43,990
hooks but we're gonna talk about hooks

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,330
in view because I think that we talk a

00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,770
lot about hooks and react and a lot of

00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,389
people might not know that hooks are

00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,580
available in view or that they will be

00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:53,080
available in view but just recently

00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:57,310
something changed

00:05:53,080 --> 00:06:00,190
we have hooks into X in u3 we're

00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:02,200
actually changing them to be composition

00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:04,360
components how many of you have had

00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,830
software change right when you were

00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,940
working on it you had to update some

00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:11,260
code yeah like most of us right so a lot

00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,810
of the code that you're gonna see here

00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:15,910
works experimentally in 2x it won't work

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:17,889
in future versions in 3x we're gonna

00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:20,289
have a slightly different API for it but

00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:23,680
that all of the underlying concepts are

00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:25,690
the same ok so what makes hooks so

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,430
interesting what makes hooks in

00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:30,219
framework world in general

00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:33,010
aside from react also with you just like

00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:33,670
altogether so exciting it's because

00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,500
there

00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:37,030
times when you need disparate pieces of

00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,500
stateful logic and you need to

00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,690
encapsulate them so that you can use

00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,820
them all over your application and use

00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:44,860
them in myriad ways so let's look at

00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,960
this food example occasionally made for

00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,420
example you can see how the corner

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,640
animates that logo and then the food

00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,970
actually animates as well those titles

00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,170
animate in so with each of these

00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:59,380
restaurants the text does the same

00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:01,330
animation as we work with it so we might

00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,280
want to keep animation consistent across

00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,830
an application we might want to reuse

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,960
that same kind of animation in different

00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,950
ways just like we do with design systems

00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,080
and patterns and this is done with

00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:12,820
JavaScript right it's not done with CSS

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,920
so I might want to encapsulate that

00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:18,220
stateful logic of the animation and

00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,990
reuse it in several different ways you

00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,420
might have noticed that the logo it has

00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:24,820
this lettering animation that I showed

00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:27,550
but what I didn't show was that if you

00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:30,730
you know kind of bring the window down

00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:32,530
for using a media query basically you

00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:35,230
not seeing that animation anymore if

00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:37,150
you're on a phone it doesn't fire so a

00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,380
media query is something that I mean

00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,120
javascript is something that I might

00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,590
want to use all over the application as

00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,360
well I might want to use the aunt the

00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:45,040
animation separately from the media

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,400
query and I might want to use them both

00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:51,010
together so in the first hook will

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,560
gather some some information about the

00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:55,390
window width and in the second we use a

00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,400
conditional to show different animation

00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:00,310
logic depending on the window size so

00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:03,240
now we can resize reuse the first hook

00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:06,220
for other tasks because it's decoupled

00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,380
now we passed the first hook as a

00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:10,090
parameter to the second hook and we're

00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,920
allowed to the compose those pieces

00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,560
together and this is where it's really

00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:17,110
really cool because hooks achieve what

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,120
mix-ins do but they avoid two main

00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,040
problems with mix-ins because mix-ins

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,150
in view can also achieve the same things

00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:28,090
they allow us to pass date and they also

00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:30,910
make it really explicit where that logic

00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,979
is coming from by the return value so if

00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,479
you're using more than one mixin they

00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,430
are not aware of each other they don't

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,170
have any access to each other or access

00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:40,510
to each other's state but we're but with

00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:43,660
hooks we actually have the ability to

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:45,820
compose multiple disparate pieces of the

00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,320
logic together so if you want to learn

00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:50,200
more about that there

00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,870
the article here and a demo here and a

00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,030
repo that you can check out so those are

00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:58,210
all things that you can explore cool

00:08:55,030 --> 00:09:00,160
let's move on to the next thing alright

00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,900
let's talk about how to make your

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,750
existing site a little bit more

00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:06,790
intuitive use using page transitions the

00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,550
web has become under critique in recent

00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:11,230
years because it doesn't for iOS and

00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,390
Android apps we get these nice slick

00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,730
smooth animations from one state to

00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:17,950
another and the web doesn't typically do

00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,720
that right for every new page we

00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:23,140
actually have to remap all of those

00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:25,180
values so this is a heat map of an eye

00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:27,550
on a page as you go from page to page

00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:30,070
you're having to actually remap of all

00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:31,870
of those pieces of of the space and

00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:34,150
actually it encouraged a lot of

00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,580
cognitive load because you have to

00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:40,630
create those mental Maps every single

00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:43,080
time so what if we reduce this cognitive

00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:45,700
load and maintain state for the user I

00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,590
love this example by Kathy Sierra from

00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,150
badass making users awesome it's like

00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:51,430
every time you use one of these stoves

00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:53,800
you just have like a second where you

00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:55,720
have to think about what knob goes to

00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,290
what burner but if you just change it

00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,600
slightly just just slightly the

00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:03,610
cognitive load goes away you actually

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,650
know exactly what burner is associated

00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,720
with what knob and we're not incurring a

00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:09,280
lot of things here we're actually doing

00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,530
less work we're just showing people

00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,450
exactly where it is

00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:15,430
so recently JIRA made an update that

00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:17,080
reorganized all of the information on

00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:19,000
the page and they did this in a way to

00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,670
make sure that everything was clustered

00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,560
in similar areas so that you could scan

00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,180
and understand it much better but what

00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,340
was interesting about this release

00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,870
wasn't necessarily these two page views

00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,560
it was how they did it

00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:34,090
so not only does the final design

00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,010
adequately arrange everything so that

00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:41,380
you can scan more easily but the way

00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:44,530
they was to bring a lot of Av problems

00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:47,290
today the way they announced it was to

00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:50,590
show all how all of those spaces are

00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:52,300
remapped and moved into place so to

00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:54,430
achieve effects like this on the web

00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,710
we're going to use a thing called next

00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:59,620
so if you used react and use next Jass

00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:00,850
next is views version of that it offers

00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,670
server-side rendering

00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:05,380
and code splitting and all sorts of

00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,269
other things that also had offers page

00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:10,269
transitions directly under the hood oh

00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:13,449
and also out of the box wrapping so in

00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:15,339
order to create fully routed view

00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:17,529
applications all you have to do is put a

00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:19,380
dot view file in the pages directory and

00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:21,459
it'll set up routing for you it'll

00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:23,230
automatically create something like that

00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:25,630
and then you can also see in Lance

00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:27,009
default up view we have this persistent

00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,360
layout we're going to use for each one

00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:29,709
of the pages but you can make several

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,209
different layouts like let's say you

00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:33,040
have a blog layout or something like

00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:35,230
that you can have you reuse those

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,819
components as well so if you're not

00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,139
familiar with view single file

00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:40,209
components this is what they look like

00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:42,459
you have a template area where you have

00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:44,290
your HTML you have a script area where

00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:45,550
your view script and you have your style

00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:47,380
which you can also scoped to the

00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:49,930
component you either use the scoped

00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:52,750
keyword or attribute or you don't and

00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:54,699
then its global but usually we kind of

00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:56,589
suggest that you work with these scoped

00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:58,449
styles so what's nice about that is you

00:11:56,589 --> 00:12:00,790
have everything kind of encapsulated in

00:11:58,449 --> 00:12:03,639
one dot view file and that's how you

00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:05,230
make you know one of these pages so

00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,699
you'll be given an index page in the

00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,380
pages directory and if you set up a

00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:10,420
mirror one with links that point to each

00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,339
other you can see you already have a

00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:15,220
fully routed application this is like

00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:17,769
one terminal commands and then creating

00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,350
a file and that's it so that's super

00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:22,569
cool but there's something more in view

00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,670
we have a transition component and that

00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:27,160
allows us to have hooks to apply

00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:29,920
animation for the enter and leave States

00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,660
and next assumes that you might want

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,569
this functionality out of the you know

00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,880
just out of the box so it actually

00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:39,250
offers that page transition hook right

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,560
there for you so you don't have to do

00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:44,769
any kind of setup you can just plug into

00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:47,470
the CSS classes and use those to create

00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:49,810
animations and then you can have layouts

00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:52,269
for that go into you know have an enter

00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:54,100
and leave States another thing that's

00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:56,019
cool and this is what I personally like

00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,910
is they also have JavaScript hooks that

00:12:56,019 --> 00:13:00,339
you can work with so you can make really

00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:03,820
dynamic stuff so you can do things like

00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:06,430
this never do this

00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:09,640
this is just me messing around just

00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:11,200
never do that to users but you can but

00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,420
you shouldn't this is kind of like the

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,120
software and ethics talk that we saw

00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:19,660
earlier like you should you can't don't

00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:22,720
do that okay so these JavaScript hooks

00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:24,190
we have these transition modes so you

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,140
can see that I'm using this library

00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,440
called green sock work and use tween Max

00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:30,040
and I can apply all of these really cool

00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,500
animations to it

00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,680
I'll have this transition mode that says

00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:38,740
out in that means wait for one page to

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,840
leave and then do the animation of the

00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,760
next page coming in which is really cool

00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,500
because usually we don't have that and

00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,240
there can be like things happening at

00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,460
the same time which you can solve with

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,290
like weird delays but like if you change

00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,150
the vet the timing value then you have

00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:54,310
to update the late delays or you can do

00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:57,130
a callback which can lead to callback

00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:59,530
hell here we're literally just saying

00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:01,660
transition mode out in it waits for the

00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:03,580
entire thing to transition out and then

00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:06,460
brings the new page in which is actually

00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:08,050
kind of hard to implement not too hard

00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:11,320
but it's a it's a little bit of a slob

00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:14,170
so you can make things like this where

00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,880
you can have really slick animations

00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,950
that come per page if you pay attention

00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,300
all of the ways that the text and

00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:22,060
mountains are coming in are a little bit

00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:24,190
different per page too so each one has

00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:26,050
kind of like an individual page I could

00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:28,000
have set it up so that they all use the

00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:30,310
same one and that default dot view that

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,170
layouts default but I could also do one

00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:34,090
that's particular for each one and

00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:37,210
because it's done with SVG it's like

00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:39,490
super easy to make responsive the SVG

00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:42,970
scales and it's the same kind of

00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:44,710
functionality for each okay so here's

00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,600
where the repo and the demo are to check

00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:48,940
out but this is the first step let's

00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,770
take it further really what we want to

00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:53,320
make is something like this where when

00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:55,660
we go from page to a retaining State for

00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,950
the entire option we're going through we

00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,570
have a few different things we can do

00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,970
but we can even switch the users and

00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,950
then we go to the page and it has all of

00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:04,840
that new users information as well and

00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:06,940
it changes all of the kind of

00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:09,490
information for the application so we

00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,560
can have a more personalized view but we

00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:13,450
still have those specific pieces of

00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:17,140
animation that look really slick per

00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:17,710
page as well so first we set up of UX

00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,750
store

00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:23,440
a victorious similar to Redux if you're

00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:25,570
used to react so here we in the store

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,820
we're storing the page that we're on and

00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:31,270
a mutation that allows us to update that

00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:32,920
page then we'll use that that mutation

00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:35,320
to update the state by committing it in

00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,390
middleware so middleware gives us access

00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,370
to the root context where I can say like

00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:41,110
what page are you ok great thank you

00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,930
and then I store it in the store that's

00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:46,390
available application but I also have to

00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:50,589
add that middleware and register it in

00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:52,899
Knox j/s in the nuts config j/s and then

00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:55,120
in layouts default view I have the app

00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:57,160
navigation component that persists on

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,630
every single page so that app in epic

00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,209
ease navigation if I put it in the

00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,560
layouts default basically all of our

00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:05,380
page is going to be routed through that

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,420
next component but I can put things you

00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:10,450
know like headers and footers above or

00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:13,510
below and they say stay persistent so

00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:15,670
then in the app knavish in' i'm going to

00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,410
create a transition group component

00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:20,279
let's talk about that transition group

00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:23,740
component real quick transition group

00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:26,320
component applies flip under the hood so

00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:28,029
we you know view already gives you this

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,459
transition group component you can just

00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:32,230
wrap anything around it and then it will

00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:34,900
apply these flip animations does anybody

00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:37,450
know what flip means yet like one or two

00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,400
people that's ok it's it's not commonly

00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:41,290
used but basically if you're trying to

00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,810
move a lot of different things on the

00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:46,360
web using transforms is the most

00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:48,400
performant way to do that but the way

00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,900
that's most performant to use these

00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,270
transforms is to get the coordinates

00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:55,209
from the first elements position find

00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:57,220
its last position and invert that so

00:16:55,209 --> 00:17:00,640
finding the distance between those and

00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:03,010
then so its first last invert play now

00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,860
that's ok to implement for one element

00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:08,620
but it becomes kind of hard to do for

00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:10,120
like lots and lots of elements so rather

00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,890
than making you and that's actually when

00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,290
the performance is really really good

00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:15,370
right that's when you really want to

00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:17,770
have something like that so that

00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:19,809
transition group component applies all

00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,910
of this logic under the hood so it's

00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:24,220
really cool so we can do something like

00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:26,709
this where we wrap all of our elements

00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:28,990
in the nav and then we apply some styles

00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:30,840
so we're just going to apply it these

00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,880
transitions just say like ok

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,340
when you're transitioning generally do

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,980
this and then we tell it where we want

00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:40,380
it to be in the last place like on that

00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:42,510
page there's a page called place we're

00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,690
applying a class conditionally based on

00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:47,760
the that view X store and now you know

00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:50,340
how to make all of those animations so

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,159
our storing the page context and then we

00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,750
basically just apply some transitions

00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:57,029
between them or we can use CSS or

00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,159
JavaScript and it works for each one of

00:17:57,029 --> 00:18:01,409
them cool so that's something that you

00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:02,970
can do in your applications I have my

00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:05,309
demo with view and next I wrote an

00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:07,470
article about it and then Simona Cochin

00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:09,480
forked it to angular and Shawn Wang

00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,820
Swick's who's on my team now at net

00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,880
laughs I forked it to react so you can

00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:16,799
actually use this on any one of those

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,600
frameworks that doesn't have to be even

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,010
X it's that's like basically the

00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,580
concepts that you're gonna be using for

00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:25,559
each one of those frameworks okay so we

00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,149
just looked at some ways to create

00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:29,070
seamless page transitions and animations

00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:30,750
on the web and as you saw some of those

00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:33,720
experience what experiences were

00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:36,450
responsive and at this point you're with

00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,669
some design right that's the thing that

00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:40,529
we typically do it's been around for a

00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:42,690
while so we can accomplish a lot of

00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:45,390
responsive with grid flexbox media

00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:47,399
queries but what if our websites weren't

00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:51,029
just responsive in two dimensions but

00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:54,029
three what if the browser offered some

00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:56,429
bait expects to hook into and create

00:18:54,029 --> 00:19:00,570
these experiences with ease just like

00:18:56,429 --> 00:19:02,460
box or media queries so if we had a

00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:05,130
phone and we're browsing and looking at

00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,529
this kind of experience here and we have

00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:10,980
like a kind of cheap headset that we pop

00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:13,260
it into and at first it's just kind of

00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:17,549
like the same thing and it moves around

00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:20,159
and it's kind of the same experience but

00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:23,010
what if we detected that and it also

00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,809
knew hey like this is a scene that you

00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:27,360
actually want to pan around and if

00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:29,909
you're in on a site where you're like a

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,169
hotel or it's place-based you might

00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:32,340
actually want that information right

00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:35,730
that gives you so much more information

00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:37,529
than the two-dimensional version so I

00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:39,360
made this demo the technique these

00:19:37,529 --> 00:19:40,860
techniques that you can do using some of

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,919
the stuff that I just showed you with

00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,760
the View knucks page transitions so here

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,480
we're going into

00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:50,190
the stir damn I did you know a click

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,660
here but you can also do with detected

00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:56,010
by the headset and then you can look

00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:58,680
around so your look full seen you get

00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:02,100
better sense of what it would travel to

00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:03,630
Amsterdam on the page itself we capture

00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,210
the coordinates of the mouse as it moves

00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:08,730
and then we'll update some transforms as

00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:12,540
well as prospective origin on those Dom

00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:14,550
elements will also create sphere buffer

00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,050
geometry with three J s with the

00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:18,210
location image as the mesh so what I

00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:21,210
mean by that is I create a circle I

00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:23,520
apply a mesh to the inside of that

00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:26,070
circle right that's how I'm putting that

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,750
in and then I'm going to take the camera

00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,400
and I'm going to pull it so that it's in

00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,200
the center of that circle and can pan

00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,210
around the circle so that that mesh is

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,420
now something that we can look around in

00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:38,400
yeah but what's interesting here though

00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,800
is not actually how it was made with

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,810
current browser technologies but how it

00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,480
could feasibly may be made in the future

00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:47,520
with a new spec if ENDIF the specs

00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,160
allowed for it so if we want to make

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,190
this div a circle we can apply a border

00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,890
radius but what if to make it a

00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:58,440
dimensional circle with grass what if we

00:20:55,890 --> 00:21:01,710
had something that had at media VR and

00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:05,880
we can simply apply with a bit of cess

00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:08,400
something like material so here's what

00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,290
we do in three J s we have a few

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,780
different and maps and things that we

00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:14,550
can materials we can work with but you

00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:16,280
know three J's can be kind of hard to

00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:18,960
set up so what if would the browser

00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:21,240
offered these capabilities when it

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,300
detected something that was 3d or more

00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,970
3d experiences this is a leaked

00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:29,310
screenshot of the chrome dev tools it

00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:32,310
might be of what might be on the horizon

00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:33,930
for 3d responsive coming out so if you

00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:35,520
don't already know Josh Carpenter you

00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:37,380
should follow him on Twitter he posts

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,720
really amazing stuff so this is them

00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:42,060
building out these like basic primitives

00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:46,080
that you might be able to use in the

00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:47,730
future so here's a detailed view of a

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,320
chair and what that might look like if

00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,330
you're in a two-dimensional experience

00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,220
same thing it's just like a flat

00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:55,440
experience it's totally fine but if you

00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,910
have the ability to pan around then you

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,410
get offered some things by the browser

00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:02,580
to make that experience

00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:05,220
a bit more rich cool so in fact he was

00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:07,380
on the a-frame team who invented some of

00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,240
these primitives for 3d experiences so

00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,070
here's a demo showing some of the small

00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,950
primitives that you can use for some

00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:15,840
more complex scene and also dual

00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:20,310
inspector that comes with that that they

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:22,110
might be being used in chrome and it

00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:24,300
doesn't end there if we're building

00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:26,610
using building blocks of to explore

00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:29,250
augmented reality as well what if the

00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:31,920
browser let us extend what the user was

00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:34,020
seeing and give us information and you

00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,330
know that was encapsulated within it

00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,350
using native specs right now we can

00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:39,900
accomplish something like this with a

00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:42,090
our kit but what if these experiences

00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:45,900
were available to us with native

00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:47,640
JavaScript and CSS think about it how it

00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,500
could advance our Tiki teaching

00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,410
capabilities if you have to learn

00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:55,080
chemistry from a textbook or something

00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:57,690
like this as a kid what are you learnt

00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,430
likely to remember I mean look and think

00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:01,920
about the periodic table of elements and

00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:03,750
how you learned all of these things you

00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:06,660
can actually get a sense of how things

00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:10,080
combine and how they you know work

00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:14,420
together and maybe even how they kind of

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,420
work together to make something new I

00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:20,160
mean we talked about emotions attaching

00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:22,350
to the limbic system this makes it much

00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,360
easier for me to connect those dots and

00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:27,140
recall so the abilities and capabilities

00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:29,550
for teaching are really extraordinary

00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:31,890
and you can apply this to learning other

00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:33,720
tactile things as well like piano I

00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:36,810
guess it's not wanting to play because

00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:40,050
the computers hate me today there we go

00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:41,580
so if we're playing piano really these

00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:44,070
notes are an abstraction for your

00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,660
fingers right that that's a metal mental

00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:47,580
model that you have to connect those two

00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:50,130
things so we're actually just reducing

00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:52,800
the cognitive load of those notes and

00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:54,450
making them connected more intrinsically

00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:59,490
with the piano that you're actually

00:23:54,450 --> 00:24:02,880
seeing okay we are going to jump out of

00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:05,160
this and try this again let me try to

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,890
not lose my cursor this time can I do

00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:10,490
that no I definitely can't okay it's

00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:10,490
this way yeah

00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:26,869
all right wants to see a volcano three

00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:29,909
two one look at that live but let's

00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:37,769
pretend you're an airplane and fly over

00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:40,739
the tornado we're learning about DNA and

00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:43,169
genes things that we can't see and so

00:24:40,739 --> 00:24:46,049
the most exciting thing for me with the

00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:49,829
air technology was that I could see kids

00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:51,599
get an aha moment that I couldn't get by

00:24:49,829 --> 00:24:53,429
just telling them about it the minute I

00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,139
saw it pop up on the screen I mean when

00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:56,489
can't ever walk to it you actually get

00:24:55,139 --> 00:24:58,709
to turn around and look at things from

00:24:56,489 --> 00:25:00,719
all angles so it gave us a nice

00:24:58,709 --> 00:25:02,820
perspective see if you can figure out

00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:04,589
what that might be based on what you

00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:06,599
know about the respiratory system I got

00:25:04,589 --> 00:25:09,089
to see where the alveoli branched off

00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:11,309
and I can look inside them and see how

00:25:09,089 --> 00:25:16,289
everything works which I never saw

00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:18,329
before it was really really cool I mean

00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:20,579
that's so cool right because spacial

00:25:18,329 --> 00:25:23,820
awareness is really important though how

00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:26,820
big things are relative to us how things

00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:28,919
move all of these things get big get

00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:32,700
people in classrooms super excited with

00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:35,999
this AR expeditions because we live in a

00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:37,919
world that's in 3d and we live in a

00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:39,779
world that's in motion people often

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:43,589
think of these experiences as additive

00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:47,399
but static 2d is actually an abstraction

00:25:43,589 --> 00:25:49,799
of 3d in motion this is complementing

00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:52,440
our reality not pushing us away from it

00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:54,929
an education isn't the only place where

00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,879
motion can be really effective if you're

00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:58,679
trying to buy something or you're trying

00:25:56,879 --> 00:26:00,299
to explore a product you get a better

00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:01,619
sense of it if you can look around it

00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:03,719
and that's the reason why you go to

00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:05,579
stores right is to pick it up to get a

00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:07,529
sense of it to look all the way around

00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:09,839
and you can understand these products

00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:12,859
just a little bit better if you can get

00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:12,859
a better view of them

00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:19,100
and it's not just for things like

00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:21,080
product and teaching virtual reality

00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,240
actually benefits seniors so an indie

00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,529
tease post how virtual reality benefit

00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,090
seniors she talks about some of the

00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:29,299
research that she did at Microsoft and

00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:31,220
VR with elderly people in disorders one

00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:33,470
of the participants was overcome with

00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,870
emotion as she told us she had macular

00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:38,500
degeneration the VR experience was the

00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:41,210
clearest she had seen in over a year

00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:44,179
there are even games like this see Hero

00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:45,980
Quest this is super cool so you think

00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:47,690
they create this game and it's about

00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:50,240
spatial awareness and these kind of VR

00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:51,799
AR experiences and they allow many many

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,539
people to play with it well it turns out

00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:56,510
that when you are dealing with dementia

00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:57,950
and Alzheimer's in elderly people one of

00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:00,580
the first things to go is the spatial

00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:03,460
awareness so if everyone plays this game

00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:07,279
basically what they get is the ability

00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:09,529
to detect early onset or they get the

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,269
ability to tech to detect these kind of

00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:14,000
symptoms and people that they couldn't

00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:16,130
normally detect with just basic tests so

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,539
they start to see oh okay we know that

00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:18,980
this is coming and they're able to treat

00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:21,320
them more effectively and earlier

00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:23,389
they're also because it's a game instead

00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,789
of inviting three or four or seven

00:27:23,389 --> 00:27:28,190
people to do a control testing they can

00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:29,929
deploy it and have many thousands of

00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:32,029
people try it out and the data becomes

00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:34,309
much more accurate so that can be really

00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:35,929
cool as well so I'm really excited about

00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:39,320
how some of these things can creatively

00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:41,809
be used for medicinal uses or what if

00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:44,090
it's progressive enhancement so here's a

00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:46,549
regular book that functions well as a

00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:48,590
book it's an awesome book but if you

00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:50,600
have an iPad you get a different kind of

00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:52,940
experience you can actually see the

00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,980
creatures kind of jump out and move and

00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:57,919
they're you know three dimensional you

00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:59,630
can move around with the iPad and see a

00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,029
different point of view and see them

00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:03,440
animated but the book still exists right

00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:04,909
this is kind of like the browser thing

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,919
where like the two-dimensional

00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:09,110
experience is still there the book is

00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:11,570
still there but if you have the ability

00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:14,630
for something a little bit more than you

00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:16,820
can have them so remember this from

00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:19,340
before this isn't just a metaphor for

00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:22,190
how we perceive cartoons it's also how

00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:24,200
we create them in old cel animation we

00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:26,899
broke these pieces down into smaller

00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,920
bits and they became reusable and had

00:28:26,899 --> 00:28:31,070
depth

00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:33,380
in the movies of the past that we spoke

00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:35,330
before uses techniques just like the

00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:38,740
ones we just covered where we basically

00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:41,450
have all of these different layers and

00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:45,290
this movie that's not going to play any

00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:49,790
sound for you is actually showing how in

00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:51,920
old animations they made this basically

00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:53,690
become true because they would have

00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,640
these flat pictures and the flat

00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,860
pictures didn't give that sense of depth

00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:00,470
right it was too flat it made people

00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:02,420
kind of lose faith in that experience so

00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:04,820
what they did was they make made many

00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:07,160
many layers and then they built a camera

00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:09,740
so that they could explore those layers

00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:12,380
and that depth and have the camera at a

00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:13,640
certain level the cool thing that you're

00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,290
missing it you should watch this video

00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,910
later with the sound because they've got

00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:19,520
these like trumpets playing it's like

00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:21,500
Bom Bom Bom like it's really dramatic

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:26,750
like I should do that too like me up

00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:28,340
here with like buffer arrays so you can

00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:30,800
they're actually expanding and

00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:33,050
contrasting in contracting that camera

00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:36,590
to give that illusion of depth in these

00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:38,840
old Disney movies and then what they did

00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:40,760
was create this camera and they made it

00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,040
sideways so that you could explore it

00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,530
down in just a second though they'll

00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:48,140
actually show you the video where you

00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:50,260
can see backwards and forwards how that

00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:53,330
scene looked so that's what the camera

00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:55,040
that they use but you can see how like

00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:57,050
if you're working on the web you would

00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:02,480
treat those as different z-index layers

00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:04,580
on top of each other and this is a 1957

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,860
right we still haven't done things like

00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:10,580
this on the web I love the drama of it

00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:12,560
and if this is from 1957 and we have so

00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:14,710
many capabilities like this available

00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:17,780
today that we explored just a piece of

00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:20,350
why do I feel like as Jen simmons

00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:23,600
eloquently puts it that we're in a rut a

00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:25,820
rut shaped like this why are we still

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,950
making table based layouts that are

00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:30,410
super static when we have all of these

00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:32,930
opportunities to create new experiences

00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:35,060
and share Jen's not the only one who

00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:37,580
noticed this this tweet resonated with a

00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,880
lot of people we make the same sites

00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:41,610
again and

00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,290
and you know none of them are very

00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:45,060
memorable remember when we were talking

00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:47,100
about how emotions attached to the

00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:49,620
limbic system and they make them easier

00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:51,960
to recall how are people gonna remember

00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:53,700
your project your site the thing that

00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,580
you're spending so much time building if

00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:59,370
it all is the same and no one's feeling

00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:01,800
anything when they go there it's time

00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:03,450
for us to take up some space hopefully

00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,430
some of the things that I showed you to

00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:06,900
show to you today become beautiful

00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:09,240
primitives in the web of tomorrow

00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:11,970
tomorrow but I also built them with the

00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:15,000
existing technologies for from today so

00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:17,220
it's it's time to expand our minds and

00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,550
our projects beyond the rectangles of

00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:21,150
the past as noted before anything is

00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:24,450
possible

00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:27,600
so my question for you is what are you

00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:30,300
going to build how can you and your

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,430
everyday development life push the

00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,710
boundaries of what's possible how can we

00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:36,630
all think bigger how can we make

00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:38,460
something that doesn't exist make our

00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:40,350
dreams out of code and share them

00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:43,230
because after all that's what the web is

00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:50,220
for to create these dreams and share

00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:52,350
them with each other thank you so the

00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:55,200
first question I have is um do you

00:31:52,350 --> 00:32:00,450
remember when the canvas tag was

00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:03,030
introduced to HTML and what what do you

00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:04,830
see like from Mike back into like now

00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:08,130
like the evolution of the web and like

00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:09,750
animation and also like did you did you

00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:11,640
think did you think about the future of

00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:14,010
web animation let you know around that

00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,510
time or even like even three to five

00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:17,880
years ago and like did any of those

00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:19,710
predictions come true yeah that's a

00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:23,280
great question I actually have been a

00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:24,870
developer for a very long time and I

00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:27,630
think that actually people were a little

00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:31,260
bit more creative and inventive a little

00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:33,960
while ago I I did notice that when

00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:37,050
people were first like making you know

00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:40,200
MySpace sites and dumb stuff like that

00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:42,420
and also just like exploring all of the

00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,970
ways that we could first even just work

00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:47,610
with tables people got really out there

00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:49,560
with li layouts and just tried to push

00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:52,470
the boundaries of what was possible and

00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:54,690
I think what ended up happening

00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:56,520
we ended up having to do real solid work

00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:57,960
on the web right we have to work for our

00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,299
businesses and companies and they have

00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,760
to be able to you know hit that bottom

00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:04,740
line and I do have a bunch of come talks

00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,540
that are kind of focused around how to

00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:09,059
make functional and invisible animation

00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,410
on sites so that our aren't like tada

00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:12,030
blah blah blah

00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:13,620
that kind of worked for you know these

00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:15,150
kind of businesses and companies but I

00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,530
also notice that when people make sites

00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:19,380
where they do have a little bit more

00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:22,320
room for exploration that they're not

00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:25,380
taking that chance and what I have also

00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,450
seen is that I often them in rooms where

00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:29,040
someone is sitting there going like oh

00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:31,169
it was so cool what this other company

00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:33,240
did did you see it and they pull it up

00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:35,490
we should do something like that we tend

00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,500
to only explore the boundaries of what's

00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:40,290
possible when we some there's prior art

00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,730
there there are some companies out there

00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:43,500
that push the boundaries of that I think

00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:45,960
that's stripe does a really good job of

00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:49,080
be you know affecting the bottom line

00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:51,299
and also exploring like how you tell

00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,760
stories with animation in order to hit

00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:56,460
that bottom line they're a really good

00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,380
example of a company that does that so

00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:00,570
what I guess I've noticed is that things

00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:02,940
were playful they got a little bit more

00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:04,890
serious but in the in the case of being

00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,600
too more serious we got a little bit too

00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:09,690
serious where we stopped remembering

00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:11,760
that people need to actually feel or

00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:13,260
remember your site when they go there

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,760
otherwise they're not going to be a

00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:17,280
customer they are not going to convert

00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,260
so I think that we have a little bit

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:23,909
more opportunity to play than we're

00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:26,070
doing now so you know you you know you

00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:30,720
open up your talk talking about like

00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:33,300
Apple you know how animation is - you

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,830
know evoke a feeling and you know that

00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,929
kind of touches a little bit on you know

00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:38,609
how we just interact and day to day and

00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:41,700
eventually you know essentially like

00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:43,710
psychology and you know the designers

00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:45,510
think about this - like know what colors

00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:46,710
we want to you know evoke even like down

00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:48,389
to like fast-food rest

00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,560
white colors you know is supposed to

00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:52,020
like attract you to there and things

00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:55,590
like that how do you see like the future

00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:57,000
between animation and designers and you

00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:59,220
know front-end devs like working

00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,619
together to like have it's like unify

00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:03,690
this like these ideas yeah we definitely

00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:05,880
need better tools because I think for

00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:07,230
myself like I spend a lot of time

00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:10,170
working on these kind of projects and

00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:11,910
animating and failing and things and a

00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:13,830
lot of people don't have the time for

00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:16,560
that frankly and I think that there's

00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:18,420
also like a disconnect where designers

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,520
have an idea for something they might

00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:22,140
make a movie and then like how does that

00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,850
movie turn into a reality for a

00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:26,580
developer like the designer doesn't

00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:28,830
necessarily know you know where things

00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:31,680
stop where things start and where things

00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:33,300
stop so I do think that tooling could be

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,550
better for sure and that's why I get

00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:37,230
really excited about these new

00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:38,790
possibilities for the browser as it

00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:40,800
comes out because if you have some of

00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:43,020
these primitives in the browser that

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,790
allow you to create these experiences

00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,710
you don't need to learn all of three j/s

00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:48,660
you don't need to you know understand

00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:51,680
all of these pieces in order to make it

00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:54,870
work especially things like next I think

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,820
you know things like flip I will do

00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:58,980
because I am interested in the animation

00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:00,720
but will the you know average person who

00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:02,610
needs to animate a bunch of things do

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,470
you know do that you know entire

00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:06,720
implementation probably not though

00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:08,340
they'll probably either like try it out

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,680
and make it work or they'll scrap the

00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:12,870
project because it wasn't performing so

00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:15,060
I think the more we have some of these

00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:16,530
abstractions where we can work a little

00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:19,020
bit quicker I think there are a couple

00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:21,630
of people working in this space that do

00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:23,100
really really good work but yeah

00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:24,480
hopefully in the future we see a little

00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,210
bit more of these primitives so that

00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,240
that connection gets a little bit easier

00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:32,280
to to work with mm-hmm okay so last

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,860
question here is um what do you think

00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:37,470
are the trade-offs of doing animation

00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:40,440
with JavaScript versus CSS like are they

00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:42,900
kind of codependent yeah I mean see so

00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,850
CSS can be really performant for some

00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:47,370
Dom elements I tend to do a lot of

00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:49,920
things with SVG which actually the

00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:51,510
performance is can be higher with

00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,450
requestanimationframe than it will be

00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:55,740
with CSS I ran a bunch of benchmarks

00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:58,880
about that and if you want to check out

00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:02,100
that article that's a whole article

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,380
javascript has some capabilities that I

00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:06,300
wish CSS has but isn't CSS is kind of

00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:08,670
clunky for so if you're trying to do

00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:11,340
simple animations where you're doing one

00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:12,690
state to another great it's super you

00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:15,000
know it's actually super declarative

00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:17,580
because you can be like one here one

00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,280
here do this thing in between and you

00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:21,410
can have the key frames to

00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,850
but once you start to chain things once

00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:25,250
things get a little bit more complicated

00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:27,680
i really suggest moving into javascript

00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:29,750
because of many reasons but one of them

00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,760
is that javascript can sometimes give

00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:33,080
you a time line so what you can do is

00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,640
you can make sure that things are

00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,020
following each other you can set them a

00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,090
little bit before and after each other

00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,050
you can add a label so you can say like

00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:42,050
okay

00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:44,060
everything bursts at this label and like

00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:45,890
everything happened right here and then

00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:48,050
no matter if you change the timing

00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:49,880
before it then it doesn't matter they

00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:51,170
all still keep bursting and everything

00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,120
still follows in line

00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:55,130
another thing that javascript allows you

00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,450
to do is speed up your animations or

00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:58,370
slow them down so like let's say you do

00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:59,960
something really complicated in CSS and

00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:02,270
someone comes along and they're like you

00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:06,850
know it's okay but I just want it to be

00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:06,850
like a little bit slower and you're like

00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:11,900
in JavaScript that's one line of code so

00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,190
you can actually speed up your

00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,170
animations with one line of code so you

00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:17,210
can be like oh yeah that that'll take me

00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:20,090
a little while I'm gonna need to build

00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:22,340
like at least 10 hours for that and then

00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:27,440
you like take a long lunge get some I've

00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:30,020
never done it so there's there's a bunch

00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,730
of different things like that one other

00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:35,060
really big thing is the flexibility and

00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:39,050
ease is because cubic Bezier in CSS have

00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:40,970
two handles for the those values you

00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:42,980
have some flexibility but not a lot in

00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:44,720
JavaScript you have infinite number of

00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:47,450
numbers of handles so you can make one

00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,100
ease do like hole bounce or crazy

00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:51,830
elastic eases and you don't have

00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:54,590
boundaries on those so you can do way

00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:57,350
more realistic eases and accomplish way

00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:58,970
more without having to write every

00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:01,010
single I can CSS you have to be like go

00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:03,800
up and down and up and down and up and

00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:05,840
down and like in JavaScript you

00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:09,020
basically say go here here use this ease

00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:11,200
and you're done well thank you so much

00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:12,700
Sarah thank you

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:25,869
[Applause]
