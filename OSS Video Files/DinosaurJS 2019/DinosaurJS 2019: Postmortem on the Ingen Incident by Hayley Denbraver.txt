[Applause]

00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,880
[Music]

00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,230
[Applause]

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,870
[Music]

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,470
[Applause]

00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,820
[Music]

00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:19,830
good morning we have a lot to get

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,619
through so I need a sense of whether we

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,570
have a quorum and it does look like we

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,270
have enough people here all right so

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:30,029
welcome to this meeting of the board of

00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:33,540
the Engine Corporation held here at Dino

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:38,310
J s I spoken to many of you but for

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:42,510
others is that not working that's sad

00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:44,520
okay no we're good good no chaos here

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:49,530
it's okay it's a blank slide it's all

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:52,650
good welcome to the meeting of the board

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,690
held here I've spoken to many of you but

00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:57,510
for others my name is Hayley Dunn braver

00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,550
and I've been hired to analyze the

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:05,009
failures that occurred during the

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:06,720
incident at Easley Nublar so I know you

00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:08,729
all are currently going through a rough

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,770
time perhaps and that there's

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:13,979
uncertainty about the project moving

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:16,650
forward and that's why I'm here I was

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,840
hired to review the recent incident at

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:22,259
easily Nublar cataloged the points of

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:29,039
failure and suggest next steps for the

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:30,719
project so first we're going to review

00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:34,469
the events of the weekend so we can all

00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:36,509
be working from the same page second I'm

00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:39,450
going to dive into the flaws within our

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:41,069
software design workflow this isn't

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,409
going to be about the failures within

00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:45,479
the software itself but rather the

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,780
failures within our practice of software

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,490
engineering third we're going to discuss

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,990
engineering ethics and how ethical

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:57,149
breaches compromise our project and

00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:59,670
finally I'm going to cover the idea of

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:01,609
chaos engineering and suggest some steps

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:06,719
we could take to build a more resilient

00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:08,490
Jurassic Park now first I really want us

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,050
to be on the same page with respect to

00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,480
the events of the weekend so we're going

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:15,810
to do a quick review now so show of

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,760
hands can you raise your hand if you've

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:22,980
read the written account of Jurassic

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:25,110
Park okay that's great what about those

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:30,330
who viewed the video footage

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:32,640
okay more good all right that helps for

00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,320
those who are familiar with both they

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,390
can attest that there are a number of

00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,140
discrepancies between the two accounts

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:42,480
and from my research it's clear to me

00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,370
that the video footage provides the more

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,510
accurate account so that's what we're

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,510
going to work with

00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:56,050
so first let's meet our consultants dr.

00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:58,540
grant is a paleontologist and he works

00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:02,710
with his postdoc dr. Sattler who's a

00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:04,840
paleobotanist dr. Ian Malcolm has a PhD

00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:07,090
in mathematics and is an expert in

00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,820
something called chaos theory he details

00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:12,070
this as the idea that systems are

00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,170
complex and likely to behave in an

00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:17,740
unpredictable way when even a small

00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:20,590
change or flaw is introduced relevant

00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:23,740
staff members include John Hammond who

00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:26,740
is the creator of our Park Dennis Nedry

00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:31,300
who was the lead software developer for

00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:35,350
Jurassic Park dr. Wu who's the head

00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:39,400
scientist robert muldoon who was our

00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:42,670
game warden John Arnold who was the

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,850
chief engineer and Donald Gennaro who

00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:48,550
was our chief counsel all right

00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:51,010
so now that we know the team let's

00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,900
discuss the events after a construction

00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:55,090
worker was killed in an accident

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,560
grant Sadler and Malcolm were brought to

00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,160
the park to render their professional

00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,590
opinions

00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,330
Malcolm was aware of the nature of the

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:05,650
park from the beginning and was

00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:07,900
consistently against the project he was

00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,270
convinced that the park would never work

00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:13,900
because of chaos theory but we'll get

00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:16,120
into more more of that later so grant

00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,709
and Sadler were unaware of the true

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,410
nature of the park but they were

00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:24,030
initially surprised and delighted by the

00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:26,940
dinosaurs I know I would be too

00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:29,860
now while this visit is taking place

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:32,080
Dennis Nedry was working on-site to take

00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,090
care of some software bugs we

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,500
unfortunately have since learned that he

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,470
was unhappy with the terms of his

00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,480
contract a while back he was approached

00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,210
by a competitor who wanted to open a

00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,270
similar park but wasn't above bribing

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:50,020
Nedry to steal some Enver embryos to

00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:52,870
which Nedry agreed during the park visit

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:56,020
there was a significant storm while our

00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:58,270
people were out on a tour a number of

00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,770
systems went down some the results of

00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,990
the storm and others because Ned

00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:05,960
had purposefully brought them down in

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:11,750
order to execute his plans most notably

00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:14,500
the electric fences went down now this

00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:17,389
is where dinosaur induced chaos ensued

00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,789
Nedry died while trying to get the

00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:21,770
embryos to his handler and was not able

00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:24,229
to resolve either the purposeful

00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:26,840
software vulnerabilities he included to

00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:30,340
execute his plan or the multitude of

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:33,949
software bugs that were there anyway

00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:35,690
grant discovered that the dinosaurs had

00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:37,819
been breeding even though this was

00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,259
supposed to be impossible because all

00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:42,380
the dinosaurs are female

00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:44,409
it happened because dr. Wu used frog DNA

00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:47,030
to fill in holes in the genetic code

00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:48,740
certain species of frogs can change sex

00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,930
when in a single sex environment in

00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:54,979
order to continue the species or as

00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:56,960
Malcolm puts it life finds away while

00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:59,630
grant and others were evading Raptors

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,139
dr. Sadler with the help of Muldoon and

00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:05,900
Arnold was able to manually reboot the

00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:07,729
power and Hammonds granddaughter was

00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:11,229
able to get the computer up and running

00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:11,229
again because she knows Unix

00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:19,040
this success came at a high cost because

00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,770
both Muldoon and Arnold's were lost in

00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,050
that effort and they weren't the only

00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:27,830
ones during the incident

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:32,419
we lost Nedry Muldoon Arnold and Gennaro

00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:34,040
and there were many close calls God we

00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:37,389
have we have a lot of hiring to do check

00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,389
the website tell your friends the

00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:42,650
remaining team members with various

00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:44,930
injuries and traumas were able to escape

00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:46,669
once the storm had cleared and the t-rex

00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,370
and the velociraptors were keeping each

00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:52,850
other busy and this brings the relevant

00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:55,100
events to a close alright so now that

00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,510
we're all on the same page I want to

00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:00,380
talk about software engineering at

00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:02,900
Jurassic Park John Hammonds

00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:05,479
claims that he spared no expense in the

00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:08,270
creation of this park and this is an

00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:12,229
outright fabrication ok the resort is

00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:15,050
luxurious yes and genetic engineering is

00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:17,150
expensive but I've determined through my

00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:19,910
research that we dropped the ball in

00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:22,340
terms of software let's explore some of

00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:24,560
the pitfalls in this section I'm gonna

00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:28,880
be nice to Nedry but I've harsh words

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,979
for him later from the from the evidence

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,440
that I have gathered it is clear that

00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:37,400
Ned Reid did not know he was writing

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,289
software for a dinosaur park instead I

00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,120
discovered the requirements that he had

00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:44,510
been given included vague instructions

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,720
like dispensed food at pre-recorded

00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:50,000
times write software to monitor a series

00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,370
of electric fences write software to

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,789
visually scan the area and report back

00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:58,070
and Nedry figured out what the software

00:07:55,789 --> 00:08:01,300
was for eventually and he had his

00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:03,770
suspicions confirmed by our competitors

00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:06,800
but he really should have been in from

00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:08,600
the first and if we did not trust him to

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,820
be in from the first then we should have

00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,590
hired someone else

00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:15,050
Hammond was trying to be competitive by

00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:17,000
keeping his plants under wraps but he

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,190
was setting himself up for failure by

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,390
not giving the software development team

00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:24,599
critical information in addition to not

00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,939
telling nedra

00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:29,809
what the software is for an unrealistic

00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:32,819
time line was enforced their scope creep

00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:35,219
insufficient sufficient budgeting Ned we

00:08:32,819 --> 00:08:36,599
tried to get more money to fix the

00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:39,479
problems but was threatened with

00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:43,139
retaliation and when the scope creeps

00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:46,220
and the budget is blown how much testing

00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:48,810
do you think happens and what critical

00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:55,019
features do you think are deemed good

00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:57,839
enough now all code has bugs and all

00:08:55,019 --> 00:09:00,360
code has problems and everyone has a

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:04,800
share of their flaws and there isn't a

00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:07,860
perfect but not perfect code is far it's

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:11,130
a far cry from poorly designed poorly

00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,839
documented untested code running in a

00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:17,699
production environment with

00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:19,170
velociraptors alright

00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:21,149
so it's clear that we didn't approach

00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:23,279
the design of Jurassic Park in a way to

00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:26,100
best ensure the success and the safety

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,930
of the project but I also want to

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,880
discuss the ethical breaches that

00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:33,990
occurred because they're undoubtedly a

00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:37,380
cause of the problem as well ok who here

00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:40,560
has heard of the Hippocratic oath yeah

00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:43,350
ok most good it's a pledge doctors give

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,540
and it says first you no harm who here

00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:48,660
has heard of doctors lawyers or

00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:51,680
engineers losing their licenses for an

00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:54,569
ethical behavior yeah that happens to

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:57,209
the reason that happens is that doctors

00:09:54,569 --> 00:09:59,759
lawyers and engineers are accountable

00:09:57,209 --> 00:10:02,300
for their professional behavior in order

00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:05,009
to protect the people that they serve

00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,319
certain aspects of the conception and

00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:09,449
design of Jurassic Park caused a lot of

00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:13,220
harm to the public and it should be

00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:13,220
viewed as a failing and ethical practice

00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:19,019
nedra's clearly guilty of unethical

00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:21,240
behavior he introduced flaws into the

00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:24,540
system to exploit for his own personal

00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:27,300
gain he accepted bribes to steal

00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,459
another's property he purposely wrote

00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:33,600
his code so that it would be difficult

00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:37,050
for someone else to debug and reboot and

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,250
therefore exposed his malfeasance what

00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,790
he did was illegal

00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,930
immoral unethical and directly led to

00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:47,880
the deaths of himself

00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:50,760
and others and I think it would be easy

00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:53,070
to focus on Nedry shortcomings because

00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:58,440
he's a contractor and he's not part of

00:10:53,070 --> 00:11:02,100
our main or chart and he's also dead but

00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,710
I can't let engine off the hook if we

00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,810
think of breaches of engineering ethics

00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:11,490
to only include things like sabotage and

00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:14,210
bribery we miss a larger picture Malcolm

00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:17,280
are infuriating an unapologetic

00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:19,860
consultant was right we thought about

00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,070
whether we could create this Park and we

00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,480
never considered whether we should

00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:27,570
Malcolm was of the opinion that the park

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,270
could never be safe and while we could

00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:32,250
debate the merit of that position it is

00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:34,410
clear that the potential for harm was

00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,950
much higher than originally portrayed

00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:39,330
and in interest of financial gain

00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:43,190
corners were cut that resulted in

00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:43,190
decreased safety and that's unacceptable

00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:48,690
ethical breaches have consequences in

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,760
our case they resulted in a handful of

00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:52,890
deaths other injuries and trauma and

00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,500
financial loss to multiple parties and

00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:59,700
it could have been a lot worse

00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:02,220
we got lucky I mentioned at the start

00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,890
that I have an interest in engineering

00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,780
ethics it's true and I could tell you

00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:09,030
that it comes from inside my beautiful

00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:11,310
heart and pristine soul but it isn't

00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:13,620
really the case I'm interested in

00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:16,880
engineering ethics because I'm

00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:19,560
interested in resilient Software Systems

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,960
ethical breaches have the capacity to

00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:26,010
compromise a system and that is

00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:28,140
precisely what happened here both with

00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:31,440
respect to Nedry and with respect to

00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:34,440
engine ethical breaches are a source of

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,990
chaos they're unexpected and their

00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,550
results are unpredictable training in

00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,490
and the application of engineering

00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:43,650
ethics should never be considered what

00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:45,570
our industry sometimes calls soft skills

00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:47,910
but rather they should be viewed as

00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:51,810
something to have the capacity to make

00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:52,110
or break your system my final point of

00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:55,649
just

00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:59,040
fashion is chaos engineering as we have

00:12:55,649 --> 00:13:01,260
seen engine system experienced a high

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,899
degree of chaos in the form of unethical

00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:07,019
behavior fragile system design and

00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:10,890
simple bad luck the storm compounded

00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:13,589
problems for instance if the board

00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:15,839
decides to move ahead with rebuilding

00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:17,610
and reinvesting in the park

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,470
I believe that chaos engineering is

00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:22,380
should be employed as part of the system

00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:25,290
design but what is chaos engineering

00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:27,560
well chaos engineering is the practice

00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:29,880
of breaking your system on purpose

00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,430
observing how the failure propagates

00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,079
through the system and documenting how

00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:36,269
the team was able to respond to the

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,550
problem this is essentially what

00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:43,040
happened at easel a new bar - the on

00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:46,230
purpose part so how do we approach this

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,769
first recommendation break things on

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:52,050
purpose but don't start with prod break

00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:54,180
it to have instance see what happens how

00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:58,910
your team responds release a

00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,910
hypothetical Velociraptor not a real one

00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:05,640
second recommendation is to start small

00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:08,490
and iterate break something small make a

00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,380
prediction of what will happen and see

00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:12,990
what actually does resolve the incident

00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:15,720
and refactor to prevent the propagation

00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:18,180
of the failure that was observed then

00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,010
break something else and repeat train

00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,600
your staff on incident response so they

00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:24,690
aren't scrambling to figure out how to

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:29,490
turn the generator on or say how to

00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:32,220
reboot the electric fence a final point

00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:34,440
to provide perspective another term for

00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:37,620
chaos engineering is failure injection

00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,180
it might seem weird to think of

00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:43,050
something that includes the word failure

00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:46,410
as a positive thing so if that trips you

00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:48,860
up focus on the word injection and think

00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:52,680
of chaos engineering as a vaccine

00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:55,670
something bad viral proteins dead or

00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,959
attenuated viruses or a software bug is

00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:01,079
injected into a supposedly healthy

00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:03,600
system the system responds addresses the

00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:05,490
issue and retains the ability to address

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:10,220
the problem when it's encountered again

00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:13,350
it becomes stronger by being exposed

00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,790
upon reviewing the events it became very

00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:18,240
important to me to talk both about

00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:20,009
engineering ethics and chaos I really

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,129
think that these ideas reinforce each

00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:25,470
other especially for systems that are so

00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:28,199
critical it could be argued that we have

00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:30,720
an ethical responsibility to build a

00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:32,449
resilient system when the human cost of

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,160
failure is so high

00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:37,259
additionally the ethical practice of

00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:40,079
software engineering removes an element

00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:43,110
of chaos from the system things may

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:46,679
still go wrong but from mistake not

00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:49,860
malice it's my opinion that any further

00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:52,410
progress on Jurassic Park should go

00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:57,899
forward with these two ideas as its base

00:15:52,410 --> 00:16:01,019
or it shouldn't go forward at all so how

00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:03,569
do we use these ideas to build a better

00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:06,139
Park well I want to close my talk with

00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:09,269
the following recommendations

00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:12,149
recommendation number one appropriately

00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:16,949
budget resources to software design and

00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:19,170
testing recommendation number two

00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:24,779
increase transparency between

00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:26,730
stakeholders no surprises recommendation

00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:28,920
3 hire professionals you can trust

00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:31,499
listen to them and make sure they have

00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,529
the necessary resources and hire enough

00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:35,699
people don't discount your staff

00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:37,889
Jurassic Park had initially been

00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:40,350
designed not to require a lot of people

00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:42,449
but better software automated software

00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:45,899
it doesn't negate your need for a

00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:50,790
well-trained capable staff to respond to

00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:52,649
incidents recommendation for use the

00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,449
principles of chaos engineering to

00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:57,829
refine your design before there are

00:16:54,449 --> 00:17:03,720
actual velociraptors running around and

00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:06,000
finally maybe just don't as Malcom puts

00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,850
it this park might have been doomed from

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,819
the start the stakes are too high and

00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:13,919
nature is too complex ask yourself

00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:17,399
whether you should not just whether you

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,549
can all right it's time to call the

00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:19,549
question

00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:25,410
how many arrived how many are in favor

00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:29,340
of reinvesting in Jurassic Park

00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:30,600
I want to see a show of hands okay fair

00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:35,210
enough

00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:39,750
how many want to kill the project okay

00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:42,660
that was pretty evenly spit split but it

00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:48,660
seems like they're slightly more restart

00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:58,559
so we're gonna go with that the project

00:17:48,660 --> 00:18:01,170
will be restarted may God have mercy so

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,390
thank you so much if you'll allow me a

00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:05,790
minute I want to address you as myself

00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:07,590
and not in character thank you to the

00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:09,090
dinosaur jeaious team for having me and

00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:12,030
my talk to the conference it was a

00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:14,970
pleasure my real job I don't actually

00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:17,429
work for engine is as a developer

00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:19,860
advocate at sneak it's my job to get

00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:21,990
feedback from devs and to learn about

00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,090
the challenges that they face and to

00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:26,520
help them out so if you ever want to

00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:28,530
talk open-source and security please

00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,900
don't hesitate to drop me a line at the

00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:34,470
email address on the screen or on my

00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:37,260
Twitter I'll also be posting these

00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:39,210
slides on that Twitter account fairly

00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:43,620
soon so you can check that out if you're

00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:45,780
interested and finally a short shout-out

00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:48,210
if anyone's interested in learning more

00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:50,460
about security you can join a

00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:53,160
vendor-neutral security education the

00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:55,260
focused community that I helped run it's

00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,780
called the secure developer and we do

00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:00,960
virtual events and we have a slack group

00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:04,820
that's a lot fun so thanks again and

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,820
remember life finds away

00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:15,570
so you know in terms of a XK you know we

00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,100
you know we have you you talked about

00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:20,130
you know how to you know get started

00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:22,320
with chaos engineering but for a lot of

00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:24,630
you know and I'm sure a lot of us have

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,470
had this situation where you know we

00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:30,830
don't put you know either we or

00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:34,860
leadership does not put enough time into

00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:36,779
you know handling failures or even

00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:41,149
that's just testing in general how do

00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:43,830
you make the case to somebody in charge

00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:46,529
so it's interesting and I think about

00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:49,110
this a lot as well because my job

00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:52,320
intersects with security and there are

00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:54,570
certain types of problems that people

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,149
don't notice or think about the issue

00:19:54,570 --> 00:20:02,809
until something goes wrong and so you

00:19:57,149 --> 00:20:07,019
have to purposefully intervene and

00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:09,960
decide to proactively address these

00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:14,070
things and that's a hard sell because I

00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:17,519
think sometimes you know you want to

00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:19,590
know the business value of something you

00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:25,169
know the higher-ups want to know that

00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:28,909
their team is like doing work that that

00:20:25,169 --> 00:20:31,980
is making money right but the thing is

00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:36,269
is you really have to understand the

00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:41,100
cost of failure and that's hard I don't

00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:44,340
think I have a full answer but one thing

00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:47,179
I would say is that I think we need to

00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:52,169
learn how to talk to other teams better

00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:55,110
so being able to discuss things like

00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:58,799
this with product with higher-ups

00:20:55,110 --> 00:21:03,049
c-suite different business people is

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,049
really important and I think sometimes

00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:07,769
having these conversations having any

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,529
conversation is kind of seen as a soft

00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:13,080
skill or like you kind of want to put on

00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:18,809
your headphones and head down and you're

00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:19,830
coding but but it's not that way it does

00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:22,560
have business value

00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:24,860
and we need to learn as dads how to have

00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:29,400
those conversations yeah I agree

00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:33,210
so I came across one of your blog post

00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:35,520
about how you know you should reuse your

00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:37,680
talks and you were talking and you know

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,380
I noticed that you mentioned right right

00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,960
when I introduced you that you said this

00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,130
talk was from like a previous talk you

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,690
want to talk a little bit about the

00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:48,420
evolution that you took you touched that

00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:53,550
on your blog post a little bit yeah

00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:56,040
so part of my job now is to go to events

00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:58,710
like this and to give talks and it would

00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:04,590
just be way too overwhelming to do a new

00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:06,990
one every time and so I have talks I

00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:10,620
like to iterate and it's kind of a

00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:14,310
similar process to code in a way like

00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:16,800
you have a minimal Viable Product like I

00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:19,670
do have slides like I am covering the

00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:23,940
things that I'm supposed to cover but

00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:25,620
time and experience will show you kind

00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,020
of like what needs to be tweaked a

00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,850
little in that kind of thing yeah okay

00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,410
so do you want to talk a little bit

00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:34,050
about the evolution of this talk like

00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:38,880
what did you add in that you took out of

00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:40,530
evolution Thunder yeah yeah just like it

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,320
would you yeah how did it grow you know

00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:46,050
over time well so when I first submitted

00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:49,230
the talk I wasn't sure I would do it in

00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:51,930
character mm-hm but I decided like what

00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:54,120
the heck and I'm just like okay I'm

00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:58,020
doing it in character and it was a small

00:22:54,120 --> 00:23:00,150
audience like fit dingo well that's okay

00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:06,300
like I'll live no one has died from

00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:08,730
public speaking just FYI well and so

00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:12,300
I've iterated from there including them

00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:16,770
changing the title to give more of a

00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:19,140
surprise but okay so you want to tell us

00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:22,110
about like just a process of like you

00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,720
just got like the inspiration like were

00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:26,370
you just watching like your trash

00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,170
Jurassic Park is my favorite book in the

00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:32,910
world because I'm norm

00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:38,130
and I really really like tech

00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:41,700
conferences but I the talks I value have

00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:44,940
an element of storytelling and so my

00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,700
love for that kind of talk just paired

00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:50,930
really well with this kind of subject

00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:53,700
whenever I give a talk I try to relate

00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:58,650
technical information but in the end I

00:23:53,700 --> 00:24:01,290
want people to leave remembering the

00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:04,740
talk and being excited about their job

00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:08,760
and maybe having a nugget of something

00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:13,500
to take away and I try to do that with

00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:15,900
storytelling great so I have just a one

00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,910
other question here but before I'm going

00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,980
also checked Twitter M double check and

00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:21,990
see how how we're doing on there see if

00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:25,520
you oh we do have a question here okay

00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:27,870
so do you have any thoughts on

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,030
introducing chaos in production

00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:32,880
environments oh I think there's a place

00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:36,210
for that for sure but if your team is

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,760
taking the first steps in to chaos

00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:43,020
engineering I think it makes a lot of

00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:44,520
sense to start with dev but yes I I do

00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,750
think there's a place for that okay

00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,910
thank you for that question Brandon

00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:50,310
wherever you are and then I have another

00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:52,080
question here oh oh that's not that

00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:54,060
question just a comment I'll just read

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,780
it here since I already identified it

00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:59,670
from Vicki she said she said the your

00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:01,320
your talk about chaos engineering and

00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:03,180
system resilience using Jurassic Park as

00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:07,890
a simple as a sample incident was

00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:11,640
absolutely fantastic so awesome so in

00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:13,740
terms of you know you talked about like

00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,860
how you know you do a lot with just like

00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:18,570
ethics how do you you know that's

00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,340
something that I'm not very familiar

00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:24,150
with and I think a lot of developers

00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:27,510
missing story about that yeah so who

00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:28,260
here's a career switcher anyone yeah so

00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:32,160
me too

00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:34,980
all right and my first job out of

00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:38,280
college was actually as a civil engineer

00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,370
and you work for a while you take an

00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,250
enormous test

00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:45,820
and then you're licensed so I have a

00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:49,720
stamp with my name on it and if I stamp

00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:52,050
something that is sketchy that can come

00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:57,790
back to bite me and so I have this

00:25:52,050 --> 00:26:03,690
perspective of someone who was held

00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:07,080
accountable to a degree in that job that

00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:10,450
really generally developers aren't and

00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:12,250
so I really like to do the ethics talks

00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:16,510
because it gets people thinking about

00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:19,630
like what does my code mean for the

00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:23,130
end-user and am i compromising them in

00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:26,320
some way that's unacceptable and I think

00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:28,420
generally we like to move fast and break

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,780
things and I think there's a place for

00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:34,570
that but I think it's also a

00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:37,840
conversation we need to have about like

00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:39,790
what impact does our code have on

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,950
someone just because we never meet them

00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:44,800
or we don't see them doesn't mean that

00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:50,410
they're not there right so my last

00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:52,570
question that I have is if you know if I

00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:55,180
was in front of my you know my editor

00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:59,230
today what was what is one thing that I

00:26:55,180 --> 00:27:05,650
could do to just care more about ethics

00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:09,190
as an engineer so I think one thing you

00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:12,610
could do is just to take a second and

00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:15,970
pause and ask yourself questions and

00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:17,740
just like what what is this is there

00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:21,040
something about my design

00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:23,560
that I haven't thought about that could

00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:25,840
have an unintended consequence I think

00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:31,480
something that's also really important

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:34,180
is you know I have a perspective as as a

00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:37,090
white woman that might be different than

00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:40,890
my husband's perspective as the white

00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:44,590
male dev but there are things that I'm

00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:49,270
not necessarily like aren't necessarily

00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:51,370
a danger or a problem for me but I need

00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:52,060
to be aware of them because I don't want

00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:54,610
to build something

00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:58,150
that's gonna hurt someone else or so

00:27:54,610 --> 00:28:02,050
like algorithms that racially profile or

00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:04,900
things like that so I think building a

00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:09,010
team that's diverse and has diverse

00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:11,420
perspectives can 100% help with that hmm

00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:14,240
all right well thank you so much Hayley

00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:27,539
[Applause]
