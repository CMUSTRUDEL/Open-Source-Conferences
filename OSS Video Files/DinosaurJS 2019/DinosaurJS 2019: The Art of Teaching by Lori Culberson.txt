00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,340
teaching how to teach anyone absolutely

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:47,250
know Jay s - Lauri okay all right this

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,190
is me I am Lori Culberson I am a

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,380
software engineer at Home Depot and we

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,090
have a program at Home Depot where we

00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,360
actually have a code school inside of

00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:00,660
our company and that is where I work

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,820
I teach react and JavaScript and how to

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,430
deploy apps with pipelines and those

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:11,850
kind of things I am also a touring

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:13,530
School graduate I used to teach for 13

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,490
years in the public school system in

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:20,369
Houston Texas and there was a time when

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,840
I loved teaching and I still loved

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:23,969
teaching but there was a point in my

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,439
career when I said I'm ready to do

00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:27,090
something different I'm not sure what it

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,439
is yet but I'm going to do something

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,420
different and when I find it it's gonna

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,960
be great and I'm leaving the classroom

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:38,130
forever and then Home Depot called and

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:41,850
said we want you to teach coding at this

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:44,219
time it'll be with adults okay so here's

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:48,030
the purpose of this talk we're gonna

00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:49,590
talk about how students learn and then

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,200
we're going to talk about what are some

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,719
of the best practices that help students

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:59,159
learn in an empathetic and safe

00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:01,520
environment let's go ahead and level set

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:05,850
on some vocabulary first and foremost

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,439
what is a teacher a teacher is someone

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:11,459
who has knowledge that they want to

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,740
share it could be a mentor it could be a

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:16,590
senior developer it could be an

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,930
instructor to an entire workshop or a

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:22,750
class it could be a junior developer

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:26,980
talking with another junior developer

00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:28,080
what is a student a student it's someone

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,570
who learns from a teacher

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,460
it could be a mentee it could be a

00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,800
mid-level developer it could be a code

00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:45,400
school student it could be your pairing

00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:47,380
partner how do we learn before I go into

00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,090
about how we learn the important thing

00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,640
with this talk is that you identify

00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:54,640
yourself as an instructor in some

00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,640
capacity at some point you were going to

00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,490
be asked to explain something to someone

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:04,660
whether it's one on one or one on whole

00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:07,240
group because that's what we do we as

00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,700
software engineers we love to share what

00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:12,640
we know and so I'm going to give you a

00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:15,010
few tips that will help you do that more

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,780
effectively but let's talk a little bit

00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:22,660
about how we learn if I ran up on stage

00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:27,550
and I said to you I bought he give me

00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:33,160
Bob who on earth would know what I was

00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:37,690
talking about no one what does your

00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:39,850
brain do some of you maybe you were in

00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,730
the Spelling Bee you were like can I

00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:49,549
have the language of origin

00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:50,780
are there alternative pronunciations but

00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:57,530
all of you started to look for some

00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:59,900
clues what if I said I bought a hippie

00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:02,450
Bob my old one wouldn't start yesterday

00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:07,519
and the mechanic said the repairs would

00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:13,939
be really expensive what does your brain

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:17,030
do now your brain makes a checklist it

00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:19,549
found some clues your brain said okay

00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:22,910
it's something that can start you can

00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:28,009
buy one requires a mechanic from time to

00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:30,979
time and the repairs are expensive now I

00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:40,669
know you know I'm from Houston it's not

00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:43,190
a tractor must be a car what I did for

00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:46,070
you in that second sentence was I helped

00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:48,050
you build schema I helped you make a

00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:51,470
connection from something you did not

00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:55,760
know to connect to what I wanted you to

00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:58,250
learn schema are building blocks for

00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,199
knowledge it's like think of it like

00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,030
ticky-tack it's something for the

00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,800
knowledge that you didn't know to stick

00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:07,970
to in order for you to gain a greater

00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:11,180
context it's information that you needed

00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:17,630
to know before the information makes

00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:20,990
sense why is this important because new

00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:24,830
knowledge is built on already existing

00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:28,159
knowledge and prior experiences and this

00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:32,889
is a concept that was coined by Jean

00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:32,889
Piaget a Swiss psychologist

00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:42,110
and he realized that you cannot learn

00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:46,099
something new unless you have some sort

00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:49,449
of schema or you have some context for

00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:49,449
the new knowledge to stick to

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:56,819
as an educator and you are all educators

00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:59,090
you were all teachers at some point

00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:03,930
where you will be at some point in time

00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:06,060
your role is to help someone build

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,659
schema how do you do that how do you

00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:12,330
help facilitate schema building you make

00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:15,509
the content meaningful you make it

00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:17,460
relatable and you make it personal by

00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:20,789
connecting the learner to something they

00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:24,900
already understand in the first example

00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:29,120
I bought a hippie Bob that content was

00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:35,490
not relatable it was not personal to you

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:39,569
you had no connection to that word the

00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:42,870
second sentence I made it more relatable

00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:46,560
I gave it some meaning

00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:48,479
I made it personal to you because at

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,849
some point you've probably been in a car

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,289
or you someone tried to pick you up and

00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:54,169
they were late because their car broke

00:06:52,289 --> 00:07:01,650
down you understand the idea of

00:06:54,169 --> 00:07:04,469
expensive repairs for a vehicle how do

00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:06,840
we generally teach how do we generally

00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:11,729
convey knowledge to someone who does not

00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:13,770
know something more often than not we

00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:16,169
have a tendency to teach in the same way

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:18,949
that we like to learn in the same way

00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:22,110
that we like to receive information

00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:25,500
generally speaking I am a very auditory

00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:27,090
learner I like to hear things you will

00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,469
often hear me say if I ask you to

00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:33,419
explain something to me

00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:36,060
can you say that again can you say it a

00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:38,669
different way because when you're

00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,110
talking to me I'm going to take the

00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:43,110
words and I'm going to turn them into a

00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:44,819
picture so that I can map it to my brain

00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:51,210
to connect to something that I already

00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:52,500
know that's how I learn best what we

00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,509
have to understand is when we're

00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,090
teaching our students do not necessarily

00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:59,550
learn in the same modality by which we

00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:03,580
teach now let me say this about learning

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:07,629
styles unless you have some

00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:09,789
sort of impairment you learned using all

00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:12,009
of them so some people say oh my

00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:13,719
auditory learner I'm read write I like

00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:18,939
blog posts I just would just give me the

00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:21,460
docs god bless you give me you too

00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:23,009
I need to hear it I need to see it I

00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:26,289
need to play with it

00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:29,530
but we all use all of these particular

00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:32,320
modalities in order to learn so as an

00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:34,810
educator if you are working with a large

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,419
class you want to make sure that if you

00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:39,969
were developing curriculum or you are

00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:42,760
explaining something to someone that you

00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:45,160
do not just focus on one way you want to

00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,589
give give a better chance for that

00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:55,120
learner to grasp that concept with

00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:59,890
whatever is their flavor of learning how

00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,600
should we teach there are four primary

00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:07,089
ways that I'm going to talk about to

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:12,130
help set learners up for success number

00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:15,630
one set the stage for a no-judgment

00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:18,640
learning zone here's what that means

00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:21,930
before you start working with someone

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:25,959
whether it is a one-on-one two-on-one

00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:29,829
workshop make sure they understand that

00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:31,870
you are empathetic to them I'm not gonna

00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:34,089
judge you if you have a question if you

00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:41,709
make a mistake it's fine it's okay I've

00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:43,240
made them all here's my here's the one

00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:45,850
that's a little hard for some people to

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:50,620
grasp and it is the thing that I learned

00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:53,529
when I was teaching elementary school if

00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:56,649
students do not understand a concept

00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:59,709
that you are teaching it is you the

00:09:56,649 --> 00:10:04,630
instructor who needs to find a different

00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:08,649
way to convey the content to them it's

00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:10,600
very easy for us to stay to say they get

00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:13,529
paid a lot of money so I'm gonna go over

00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:17,790
at once and they need to figure it out

00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:17,790
we work with people who say that

00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:24,580
but if you embrace the role of an

00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:26,790
instructor as a true educator your goal

00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,730
should be to help the person understand

00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:32,170
I'll tell you how I learned this lesson

00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:34,240
at one point in my teaching career very

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:36,160
early i sat with our instructional

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:41,080
specialist I taught math and science

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:44,980
we had a benchmark exam and I was good

00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:46,720
my kids did well I walked into the

00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,880
office with my little notebook of my

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,830
lesson plans and grades and I was ready

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,110
for anything fire any question at me I

00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,310
got it

00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,900
and our instructional specialist said

00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,840
Laurie your students did really well an

00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:03,130
objective a and B but on C they were

00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:06,790
below 50% I opened up my notes and I

00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:09,610
said I covered that content on these

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:12,430
days I gave an assessment these are the

00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:14,880
lab activities that I did I taught the

00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,880
content

00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:24,870
she said Laurie you may have taught the

00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,870
content your students didn't learn it

00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:38,490
I was armed for everything but that cuz

00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:41,730
I was good but that instructional

00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:43,320
specialist made me better because she

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:47,660
understood that I had the skill set to

00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:50,250
be a good educator but what I lacked was

00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,260
making sure that every single one of my

00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,870
kids understood the content that I

00:11:52,260 --> 00:12:01,350
needed to convey to them and that's when

00:11:54,870 --> 00:12:03,720
I became a better teacher number two the

00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:07,320
second of the ways that we set learners

00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:12,089
up for success provide learner with

00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:14,640
clues the tech industry is riddled with

00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:18,089
acronyms you go from company to company

00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:19,589
see ICD is one thing at one company and

00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:25,920
the D changes when you move to another

00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:28,500
company you can't keep up so why do we

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,880
put why do we have our juniors and

00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,339
mid-levels who won't raise their hand

00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:34,830
and admit they don't know why do we let

00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:37,350
them struggle spell it out form tell

00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:42,150
them give it some free if you're talking

00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:44,280
in a group meeting go ahead and spell

00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:46,620
out the acronyms go ahead and give a

00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:50,520
brief description or explanation of the

00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:52,770
new vocabulary by new I mean you know it

00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,540
you know your peers know it maybe

00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:57,150
there's a couple people in the room who

00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:00,690
are not familiar with the term it is

00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:03,210
free it is a few extra words spell it

00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:06,450
out hey and you know we're working with

00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:08,610
this new CDN that we created just in

00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:11,430
your heads like as you're talking add

00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:15,089
the comma you know the content delivery

00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:17,850
network and if you see maybe some

00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:20,760
confusion say you give an example of

00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:22,200
when this person who is new to the group

00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,520
maybe when they've used it remember when

00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,930
we use bootstrap or but we had to

00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,180
install bootstrapping are in the first

00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:32,810
project give them a clue don't keep them

00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:37,250
in the dark just help them out three

00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:37,250
explain in bite-sized pieces

00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:45,180
avoid verbally overwhelming explanations

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,330
talk for only three to five minutes and

00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:50,100
then check for understanding you need to

00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:52,020
take a picture of this put a gold star

00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,420
next to that talk for only three to five

00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:58,380
minutes and check for understanding

00:13:53,420 --> 00:14:01,710
here's why as you're listening to

00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:06,420
someone talk not me of course but as

00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:08,280
you're listening to someone talk you're

00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,660
processing what they're telling you and

00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,770
if it's information that they need like

00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,210
something like you're building some

00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:15,000
software together they need to process

00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:20,940
that so they can go execute a task you

00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,900
want them to know what to do I remember

00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,200
once I was talking to one of my

00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:26,910
colleagues um a while back and he was so

00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,130
excited cuz he built built a react

00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,630
native application and he was telling me

00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:34,230
all about it and I was excited because I

00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:38,700
wanted to learn react native at the 17

00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:42,350
minute mark of him talking at me he

00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:47,130
finished and said what do you think and

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:50,630
I said I tried to jump in and ask you a

00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:54,200
question around the three minute mark I

00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:56,730
didn't hear anything you said after that

00:14:54,200 --> 00:15:00,990
the brain can only absorb what the brain

00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:05,130
can process so give people a chance so

00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:06,420
stop and ask questions but as you as an

00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:11,180
educator you need to check for

00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:17,130
understanding and here's how we do that

00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:19,470
as you are finishing up a topic you want

00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:21,270
to get some feedback as to whether or

00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:27,740
not they got what it is that you

00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:30,660
explained so you're gonna ask them hey

00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,830
why don't you go ahead and you know take

00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:34,230
a few minutes I'm gonna go get some

00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:36,990
coffee when I come back I want you to

00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:40,920
explain back to me what you understood

00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:43,680
we just talked about you could do that

00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,960
as a one-on-one what you're doing by

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,380
giving them time quiet

00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:51,630
think time is giving them an opportunity

00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,550
to maybe do a little google search maybe

00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,600
just gather their thoughts but the other

00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:58,680
thing you were doing is

00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:01,319
allowing their anxiety to decrease how

00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:04,139
many times have you had someone ask you

00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:07,050
a question maybe it was in class you

00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:09,839
didn't know the answer right away and

00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:12,990
all of a sudden you froze you had a lot

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,750
of anxiety in that timeframe so let's

00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:17,100
just get rid of the anxiety here's

00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,529
another way can do that if you have a

00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,930
large class you can do a technique

00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:24,420
called pair and share I've taught you a

00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:27,029
thing now here's what I want you to do

00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:30,959
greet the person next to you say hello

00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:33,300
give them a fist bump talk about two

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,220
things you learned and maybe one thing

00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,060
that you found confusing I'm gonna go

00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:40,800
get some coffee

00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:43,079
I'll be back here's what you've done now

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,880
no one has to admit and raise their hand

00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:46,410
in front of the entire class and say I

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,730
didn't understand this one thing because

00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:49,290
they're not gonna do it I've worked with

00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:51,269
fourth graders I've worked with 40

00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:53,040
year-olds they don't do it no one wants

00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:58,259
to call themselves out and say I didn't

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:59,670
get it so now they have a peer and now

00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:02,930
they know oh the peer didn't get it

00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:05,720
either and if I am still in the room

00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:08,699
I'll walk through the aisles and listen

00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:11,459
nine times out of ten they're confused

00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:15,630
on the same thing and guess what that

00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:17,819
means to me I have to reteach I didn't

00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:19,819
explain something well enough that a

00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:25,770
large percentage of class didn't get

00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:29,039
okay you can also have people write a

00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:31,500
summary of what they learned I like to

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,750
draw pictures I like to draw pictures

00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,370
annotate the pictures and then go back

00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:38,039
to the person that I work with and say

00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:39,450
okay let me explain this to you let me

00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:44,190
tell you what I think I heard you say

00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:46,650
and here's the important part if you are

00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:48,240
the person who it taught something and

00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:52,350
you're waiting for someone to tell you

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:57,720
what they learned stop talking put your

00:17:52,350 --> 00:18:01,400
hand over your mouth listen listen let

00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:06,440
them explain the entire thing wrong

00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:09,890
don't say a word because here's why

00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:12,920
at some point they might catch

00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:15,430
themselves and correct themselves to

00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:18,530
figure out where they went wrong and

00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:20,830
that's a really good learning tool for

00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,830
the learner

00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:18,980
okay so there is a benefit to confusion

00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:20,840
there was a study done at Columbia

00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,450
University in 2012 and here's what the

00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:26,000
results of the study said said that

00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:29,240
making mistakes making errors

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,630
facilitates learning as long as

00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,670
corrective feedback follows any of you

00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,170
who have ever built software and made

00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:39,200
some serious mistakes

00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:40,160
I don't know messed up a migration I

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,710
don't know

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:47,820
deleted a database bet you did it once

00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:50,310
you learn from your mistakes the

00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:52,110
corrective feedback was I know what to

00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:57,890
do now I'm not gonna make that mistake

00:19:52,110 --> 00:20:02,130
again there is a drawback to confusion

00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:06,960
in a 2010 study of software engineering

00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:09,960
students at Manila University they did a

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,750
study and here was the result they found

00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:17,910
that if students started out confused

00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:21,060
and they stayed confused it impacted

00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:23,540
their learning very negatively they

00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:27,300
became frustrated and they became bored

00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:31,980
they lost interest how many of you have

00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:34,500
ever started a udemy tutorial something

00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,930
went wrong with your setup you got to

00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:39,960
like step three you're all jazzed and oh

00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:41,550
gosh I can't figure out why this isn't

00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,290
working you go through the notes you

00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,900
start emailing the instructor they don't

00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:51,240
message you back we know that would

00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:52,950
never happen but you got stuck you tried

00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,770
to figure it out and you're like forget

00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:56,880
it you didn't finish the tutorial I know

00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:01,200
there's a few of you and there I know

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,010
nothing only one so why is this

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,280
important

00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:06,990
it validates the need to tighten the

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,600
feedback loop and check for

00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:11,790
understanding more frequently to reduce

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,710
the duration of confuse the longer you

00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,360
are confused the more irritated you get

00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:20,100
and the more likely you are to not

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:22,230
complete the task you walk away I've

00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,390
seen it in students I've seen it before

00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:26,760
I've seen it in fourth graders I've seen

00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:28,380
it in four-year-olds I've seen people in

00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,970
my class just get so overwhelmed and

00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:33,390
frustrated they decide to go I'm gonna

00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:34,980
go get coffee I'm like now it's because

00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:38,880
they were frustrated and they couldn't

00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:41,250
keep up so tighten that feedback loop

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,190
check in with your students check in

00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:45,810
with your your your pair make sure they

00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:48,510
are on the right path give them

00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:53,090
corrective corrective feedback once they

00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:53,090
have gone through the okay

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:10,290
why we should avoid sarcasm sarcasm is

00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:14,610
defined as a use of irony to mock or

00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:17,430
convey contempt let me tell you what

00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:22,500
happened on or at a job which will

00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:24,390
remain nameless my first week I had an

00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,920
assigned mentor and I said hey I'm not

00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:29,130
sure I understand how to set this dev

00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:32,040
environment can you help me and his

00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:37,710
response was seriously I thought you

00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:41,390
went to Harvard this is not a shameless

00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:41,390
plug for the fact that I went to Harvard

00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:50,100
however I never forgot this and this was

00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:59,280
very early in my career as a software

00:22:50,100 --> 00:23:03,020
engineer how how does that help me guess

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:07,080
who I never asked for help from again I

00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:08,970
found anyone else in the chain of people

00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,700
who worked on our development team to

00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:16,470
ask questions too and never asked this

00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:22,920
person for help again sarcastic comments

00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:26,940
are put-downs wrapped in humor there was

00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:29,490
a an article in Psychology Today written

00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:31,230
by Clifford Lazarus and the title is

00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:34,080
called think sarcasm is funny think

00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:37,320
again and one of the quotes from the

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,750
article said this despite smiling out

00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:43,200
relief many people who receive sarcastic

00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:48,510
comments feel put-down and often think

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:51,090
the sarcastic person is a jerk I mean

00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:57,420
its scientific I'm not I'm not making

00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:59,160
this up sarcasm does not belong in a

00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,290
classroom when you are working with

00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:05,720
someone who doesn't understand something

00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:05,720
it is it worth the risk

00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:14,830
and what's funny is people who are

00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:17,780
sarcastic they think they're funny but

00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:22,700
the people who are on the other side of

00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:24,050
the sarcasm don't so you make your

00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:31,010
decision as to whether or not you would

00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:36,320
like to be sarcastic so what did you

00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:38,890
learn in the last 20 minutes here's what

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,810
I would like for you to do make a friend

00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:43,280
turn to your neighbor talk to someone in

00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:47,170
front of you behind you to your left to

00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:51,910
your right you have 20 seconds to

00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:54,290
discuss something that you learned

00:24:51,910 --> 00:25:00,770
something that maybe you had an aha

00:24:54,290 --> 00:25:04,790
moment about and then we'll review 20

00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:08,230
seconds starts now okay let's review

00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:13,010
what I wanted you to learn from this

00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:15,110
talk we talked about how we learn we

00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:17,420
talked about making connections to

00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:20,540
something that is familiar to the

00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:22,130
learner got a build that schema I got to

00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,950
give the new information something to

00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:26,300
stick to

00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:33,410
we talked about how you should teach

00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:38,150
best practices ask questions give your

00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:41,500
student a chance to answer give them a

00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:41,500
chance to make a mistake

00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:46,060
give them a chance to learn something

00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:52,340
confusion double-edged sword you stake

00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:54,260
and you get confused and you solve it

00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:57,260
you get some feedback you're good

00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:59,570
you've deepened your learning you get

00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:01,640
confused you stay confused you stay four

00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:04,970
can stay confused too long it's

00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:11,320
detrimental so don't let people stay

00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:16,030
confused for too long and lastly sarcasm

00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:16,030
it does more harm than good

00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,760
thank you

00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:29,730
the first question I have here from

00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,530
Twitter says what are some good quick

00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:33,210
questions to check for understanding

00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:39,480
while teaching oh that's a great

00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:41,340
question good first question so you want

00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:45,090
to make sure that you ask the student

00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:46,950
things like so what do you think is

00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,870
happening here what are you like if

00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:51,480
you're looking at a block of code walk

00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:56,700
me through this play computer and tell

00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:59,130
me what's happening at each step another

00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:02,100
good question would be if you were going

00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:04,970
to explain this to one of your one of

00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:07,320
your coworkers how would you explain it

00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:08,700
that way you get inside their head the

00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,220
important thing is to get people talking

00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,780
you have to know what is in their head

00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,480
because then you'll know where the

00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,580
misconception is and then when you hear

00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,890
the misconception you can start thinking

00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:22,680
about how can I unravel this but you

00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:24,300
cannot fix someone's line of thinking

00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:28,410
until you know what they're thinking

00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:30,630
another thing I wanted to add is if you

00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:32,640
are in front of a large group there are

00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:35,430
some questions you want to avoid and

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,780
some of those questions include how many

00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:40,020
of you didn't understand what I just

00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:42,120
said Oh who's gonna raise their hand

00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:45,510
okay I would cuz you know I don't really

00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:47,070
care but who wants to admit to in front

00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,570
of their peers especially since you know

00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:50,490
I work in a corporate environment and

00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:52,680
sometimes we have teams of people coming

00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:54,240
who wants to be the person that says I'm

00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,700
a senior engineer and I have no idea

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,860
what she just said it's not gonna happen

00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:01,820
and that just so you let them talk to

00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:04,230
themselves or in with their peers and

00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:07,470
usually a peer can explain something a

00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:12,570
little better so the next question here

00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:14,010
also from Twitter oh thank you Marcus

00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:18,120
for that question so the next question

00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:20,220
is coming from Jett Ryan he says is the

00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,480
three to five rule the result of a

00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,870
scientific study or was something that

00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:27,120
you just learned from experience just

00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:29,220
being in the classroom

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,360
are a lot there is a study that talks

00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:35,160
about wait time after you ask a question

00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:37,170
I know that has nothing to do really but

00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,910
with how long you should talk but I

00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:40,760
really equate that to how long do you

00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:42,120
want to listen to someone talk to you

00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:46,710
mm-hmm

00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:51,030
or talk sometimes it's talking at you so

00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:53,400
the next question here is from Vicki the

00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:56,010
part about letting learners be confused

00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:59,700
how long is too long for a learner to be

00:28:56,010 --> 00:29:02,730
confused uh I don't know if there is a

00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:06,650
time a time limit on how long someone

00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:09,090
can be confused I think you have to I

00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:12,600
think you have to kind of watch and

00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:16,679
monitor so when I teach classes I

00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:18,030
generally will walk the aisles because I

00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:20,429
want to make sure people aren't checking

00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:22,500
their email that they're on slack or you

00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:25,980
know committing you know fixes to code

00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:27,540
you're in class to learn and so as I'm

00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,000
walking through the aisles I'm asking

00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:32,940
people okay show me your app what's

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,170
happening here okay this doesn't seem to

00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,360
be working this is the part you're

00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:38,250
working on do you need help or do you

00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,309
need me to come back in a few minutes so

00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:43,200
I give them that opportunity to say okay

00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:44,670
I'm I'm still playing with it like if

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,690
they're still excited about playing with

00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:52,050
it then I let them play with it if

00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:53,730
they're like I don't know you can just

00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:55,650
you can tell just by talking with

00:29:53,730 --> 00:30:01,650
someone where they are emotionally with

00:29:55,650 --> 00:30:03,240
their with their code so someone will

00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:04,470
say I mean I know this is a quote so

00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,890
Morrow know where it came from but they

00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:09,690
say patience is a virtue right and I

00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:12,090
feel like sometimes that can be a little

00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:14,790
odd or restrictive because it makes it

00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:17,280
sound like you either our patient person

00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:19,200
or you're not do you think that patience

00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,720
is something that you I mean it sounds I

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,730
mean as patience seems like it's

00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,550
something that is very important while

00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:28,559
teaching which you agree mm-hmm and do

00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:30,450
you think like it's a skill that you can

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:34,200
or something that you can learn and like

00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:36,750
well how do you learn how to do that and

00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,020
how to be more patient I think some

00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:42,920
people would say have children

00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:44,330
I don't have any biological children but

00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,670
I taught fourth graders and they were

00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:48,770
all my kids for many years so I felt

00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:53,180
like a parent in that I think teaching

00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:56,150
taught me patience whenever you are

00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:59,270
responsible for someone's learning they

00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:01,250
are vulnerable to you and so I always

00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:03,350
just wanted to be empathetic and

00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:06,140
sometimes empathetic was sitting and

00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:08,270
just listening and that was that was me

00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:11,090
exercising patience was listening and

00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:12,620
sometimes I just didn't want to but I

00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:15,010
had to in order to build that

00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:20,330
relationship so that we had a good

00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:23,150
classroom experience great so the last

00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:25,760
question I have is just um talk a little

00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:32,150
bit your journey to you know what

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:35,270
software to education background sure so

00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:37,400
I taught for a number of years in the

00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:41,590
Houston school district actually was a

00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:44,930
northern suburb called spring ISD and I

00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:48,350
was always it just it was a natural

00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:50,570
attraction to just help people and teach

00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:52,730
and I think I could figure out what was

00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:54,620
I could figure out what was tripping

00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:56,120
people up I don't know how but I just I

00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:59,540
could figure it out just by talking to

00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:01,820
them but at some point I started a

00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:03,640
computer science club for students who

00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:06,740
were like second through fifth grade and

00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:09,170
they had a lot of fun with learning how

00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:10,910
to like build AG algorithms and watch

00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:14,480
little Angry Bird navigate through the

00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:17,690
maze and so they had a lot of fun doing

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:21,770
that and I thought this is a lot of fun

00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:23,630
and I realized that that's what software

00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:25,640
engineers did and so I started thinking

00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:29,030
okay well I also want to build this app

00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:30,980
I think I may want to learn some

00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:32,660
software engineering techniques the

00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,520
other thing is I tried to build an app I

00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:36,290
contact a software engineer they said it

00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:38,360
would cost fifteen thousand dollars for

00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:39,800
them to build this feature that I wanted

00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,140
gotta be kidding me

00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,880
that's the same cost as Turing I may as

00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:48,980
well just go to learn it myself

00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:52,760
so when Turing was lower-priced
