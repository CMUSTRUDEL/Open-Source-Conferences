	It’s my party and I’ll build my own virtual social platform if I want to! by Sara Farquharson

What to do when you want to throw a huge birthday party when travel and parties aren’t possible? Try (and maybe fail!) to build your own video conferencing platform, of course! At least, that seemed like the obvious solution a few months before my own birthday. There are many ways to interact with friends online, but none I could find captured the feeling of socializing with a large group of friends in a physical space. It seems that if I wanted to host the party I imagined, I would have to build a platform myself!

Join me on my adventure of exploring: what puts the “social” in “virtual social space” anyway? How do you design the perfect distributed party? And is it possible to learn enough about WebRTC, audio spatialization, and scalable cloud infrastructure to build it in under two months, with no prior experience? Along the way I’ll talk about some of the technical challenges of building video conferencing software I discovered, which helped me understand why my dream platform didn’t already exist.

Sara is a lifelong generalist who enjoys writing code, aerial silks, and talking enthusiastically about her myriad of other interests. Previous short-notice projects she has thrown together for her birthday include: learn to scuba dive, perform a cello concert on a cruise ship, and put on a guest-filled charity fundraiser livestream.

	00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,840
all right

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,279
hello uh and welcome to my talk it's my

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,039
party and i'll build my own virtual

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,800
social platform if i want to

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,160
my name is sarah farkerson i'm at

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,760
faberfact on twitter

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,680
i'm going to talk to you about why i

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,960
wanted to throw a virtual birthday party

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,359
in the first place

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,200
uh mainly it's because i like making a

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,320
big deal out of my birthday as you heard

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,559
in that introduction

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,160
i have previously thrown a cello concert

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,160
i have baked hundreds of cupcakes for

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,160
complete strangers at events

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,320
i have gone to europe twice i like doing

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,160
a big thing and potentially inviting all

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,480
my friends to participate

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,079
uh in 2021 i was thinking maybe i would

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,600
rent a castle in france

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,199
then co it happened and it turns out

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,559
that throwing big parties or going to

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,320
france were not on the table

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,079
but i still wanted to do something and i

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,320
wanted to be able to invite

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,399
uh all of my friends i have a lot of i

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,879
have a distributed friends network um

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,640
of people all over the world um so where

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,159
could i hold it

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,600
the simplest solution is video call

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,040
software all of us has gotten very

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,799
familiar with zoom over the past year um

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,040
multiplayer games are another option i

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,200
have gone to concerts in minecraft and

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,119
birthday parties and animal crossing

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,799
and there has been an explosion of

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,720
purpose-built social spaces

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:30,079
just for holding events uh in a more

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,439
uh fun way than than either of these two

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,720
other two options including skittish

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,400
where we're holding the hallway tracks

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,320
for bang bang con this year

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,000
um so which of these did i want to

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,479
choose first i don't know what

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,159
makes a good party for me one of the

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,600
first things that has to be accessible

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,360
and i don't necessarily mean in the

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,640
closed captioning sense although that is

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,040
very important as well

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,640
but just people being able to access it

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,479
if i were to have my birthday party in

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,399
france only my friends who can afford to

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,719
go to france would be able to come

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,479
same thing if i hold my party in vr chat

00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,520
only my friends who have vr rigs would

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,680
be able to attend

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,439
so i have to think about what kind of

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,640
tools everybody will need to use to

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,560
participate

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,479
then i would like to be personal and

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,679
personally is it a lot you can't tell

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,560
anything this

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,319
image in the in the top corner but for

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,560
real life parties i have spent

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,120
dozens of hours hand making dozens of

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,520
led candles to string from the ceiling

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,440
uh to get a floating candle effect i

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,000
like personalizing my space

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,480
i also like personalizing my look this

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,200
is what i look like and i like

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,760
dressing interesting at real parties so

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,720
that

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,200
it forms a conversation starter and i

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,760
like

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,840
having that in my virtual spaces as well

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,560
i also like it to be spatial

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,879
um the worst kind of party that you go

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,200
to

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,200
is uh everybody stands in a big circle

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,440
listening to the two most opinionated

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,720
people talk in a really good party at

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,800
like a house party though

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,000
there'll be people in every room talking

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,840
about different things

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,360
these people are right here are watching

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,159
youtube these people are talking about

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,480
cooking

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,280
uh some people are throwing ball in the

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,879
backyard

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,720
getting that effect of where you can

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,000
wander from room to room and see what

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,640
different people are up to

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,519
join this party go see the cat in

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,640
another room

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,239
uh that's a really valuable thing that i

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,959
would like to replicate in a virtual

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,879
space

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,319
speaking of pets pets are an extremely

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,640
important part of parties

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,760
because that's how your introverts can

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,280
interact with people

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,959
without having to walk up to a group of

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,840
strangers and insert themselves into a

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,360
conversation

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,959
instead you go and find the cat and

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,319
everybody just talks about how cute the

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,560
cat is

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,159
kate compton here at bang bang con

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,440
actually in skittish introduced me to a

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,080
great term for this from gretchen

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,640
mcculloch

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,200
called cheese plate which is another way

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,560
of thinking

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,040
in a real party you have the cheese

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,560
plate loach both you go into the kitchen

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,400
to get some cheese and you talk to

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,920
people about oh have you tried that one

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,680
and also it gives you a way to leave

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,519
conversations in a polite way

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,360
you just say oh sorry gotta go grab some

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,920
more charcuterie from the board

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,400
um so having those sort of interactive

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,120
ways

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,040
and reasons to move from space to space

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,360
are very important

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,959
and the cheese plate or the chat pack

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,080
implies more than just the conversation

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,560
topic it's also that

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,599
interactive thing there's been a lot

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,400
said about how

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,599
video is important on when trying to

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,680
communicate online

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,959
because that way you can you can see

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,840
faces it's more than just

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,199
words and in a virtual space i want

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,919
either to be able to

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,440
you know for the person i'm talking to

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,960
to know that i'm laughing at their joke

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,639
even if my microphone isn't on

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,240
i want to be able to wave at somebody

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,120
across the room without necessarily

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,280
interrupting

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,639
whoever's speaking and a lot of times i

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,160
want to sit in the corner maybe doing

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,680
something weird and see if anybody comes

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,199
to join me that's what i do at real

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,800
parties and i want to be able to do that

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,320
in a virtual party as well

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,120
so maybe we have some kind of virtual

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,479
drawing space off in the corner there

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,880
so which of these spaces meets the

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,199
requirements video calls are pretty much

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,639
right

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,320
out they only support that kind of

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,680
one or two people talking to time and

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,520
everybody else is just an audience and

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,160
it's hard to get a real party feeling of

00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,919
that

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,759
multiplayer games can be great but i

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,600
don't actually play any of them

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,520
and so i don't know any that all of my

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,360
friends would find accessible

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,720
so the purpose-built social spaces seem

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,240
to be so great

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,320
unfortunately a lot of the best ones

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,320
like skittish and rc together

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,000
um they're not even out for public

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,160
consumption now let alone when i was

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,759
trying to work on this in december 2020

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,240
and the other ones that were available

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,039
were

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,000
fine but gather was one of the ones that

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,400
i tried that

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
was almost right but i couldn't make my

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,600
character have blue hair and that was

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,919
really important to me and i couldn't

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,520
do a custom map the way i wanted so

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,400
obviously i decided to build my own

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,960
space

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,479
uh it seemed obvious like it had been

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,680
almost a year since people started

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,320
putting events online

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,000
why hadn't anybody started why hadn't

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,039
anybody successfully made this so i was

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,440
going to build my own

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,720
first off i need a ui i know that i like

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,800
that game-like ui

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,120
so using a web-based game framework

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,880
seemed obvious it would be accessible to

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,560
anybody with a browser

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,919
and the game framework would handle all

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,319
the putting in maps

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,759
and avatars moving around so i wouldn't

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,520
have to write as much code

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,440
i found a game framework written in

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,639
javascript called phaser that did most

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,160
of what i wanted to

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,319
and a lot of these things you can use

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,319
the tiled map editor these are all

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,720
open source software you can just make

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,360
maps using free assets and

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,039
for free now i have a great ui now i

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,199
need to communicate with people

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,560
this is definitely the hardest part of

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,919
it but there is

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,759
a protocol called webrtc it's an

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,000
open source technology for peer-to-peer

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,520
communication the rtc stands for

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,319
real-time communication

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,199
so it does real-time audio and video as

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,039
peer-to-peer

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,280
it's open source there's tons of

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:42,240
libraries available

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,280
and it works just in your web browser

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,319
it's good that the libraries are

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,000
available because

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,120
implementing it from scratch is a little

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,080
tricky if you don't know what you're

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,240
doing

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,599
but i found another open source project

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,440
called jitsi

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,599
which is a video conferencing software

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,680
uses webrtc under the hood

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,840
and it allows you to do video

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,919
conferences and also modify it so

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,759
here i could modify and put my own

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,560
visual front end instead of the regular

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,160
visual

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,680
video call front end so to add that

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,560
feeling of space

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,840
uh the magic sauce is to make multiple

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,199
conversations possible is audio

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,599
spatialization with the jitsi

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,199
video conference all you have is that

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,160
video conference problem of everybody in

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,319
the same room

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,720
but with spatialization if you're on a

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,479
map as you get further away from a sound

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,360
it gets quieter until finally you can't

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,960
hear it at all

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,400
so if you're different people standing

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,759
in different parts of the map can have

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,840
different conversations

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,840
while technically being in the same room

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,520
still so you can still easily wander

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,520
from one conversation to another

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,199
it seems perfect and luckily somebody

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,520
had already made an open source

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,720
library to do audio spatialization

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,960
wrapped around jitsi

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,400
it seemed i was home free and in about

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,319
two weeks i had

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,720
managed to make a uh

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,000
this little map here where i had avatars

00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,599
i could join the call

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,440
i would have video and audio and it

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,199
would be spatialization seems like i'm

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,360
home free right

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,720
this is when i learned the hard way why

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,080
my perfect system did not exist already

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,919
the main thing it comes down to

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,319
performance peer-to-peer connections

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,840
especially using video do not scale

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,400
if i want to have a hundred people at my

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,160
video at my virtual birthday party

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,240
i would have to be sending my video

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,000
stream to a hundred people and receiving

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,319
a hundred people's video streams

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,680
and it turns out it falls apart at more

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,560
like half a dozen

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,680
um and in order for that spatialization

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,440
to work as i said

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,279
you're all in the same room so you can't

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,719
even cut it out by oh 10 people over in

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,039
this room and 10 people over in that

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,039
room

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,839
without losing that spatialization

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,839
aspect so now uh and then you add your

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,000
game front end on javascript on top

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,440
and it's just a performance nightmare so

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
now you have to have a server

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,640
you need to learn how to run a server uh

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,720
that will

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,640
take all of that video and audio and

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,360
crunch it into a custom stream for every

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,200
person

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,200
so either you have to do a lot of server

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,040
coding or you have to pay a third party

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,360
who will do this for you

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,959
and it it is does take quite a lot of

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,240
server performance so there's not really

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,760
any free services available for this

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,279
then that's not even getting into all

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,120
the polish you maybe want

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,399
authorization so only people you invited

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,320
can come to your party

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,440
you want error handling so that when

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,080
something goes wrong

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,120
your friends can reconnect you want more

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,120
customization

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,120
you want actual accessibility so

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,279
everyone has an equal opportunity

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,360
you want to maybe moderate it to kick

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,760
people out if they behave badly

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,920
so in the end i didn't successfully hold

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,360
my party in my own virtual social space

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,000
but i learned a lot and i'm going to

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,920
keep working

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,680
on it and i'm really looking forward to

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,200
things i think there will be better

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,200
tools in the future to build

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,800
this kind of thing yourself if the

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,200
off-the-shelf tools aren't working for

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,600
you

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,519
i think having performance spatial audio

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,120
libraries that allow you to plug in a

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,880
custom ui will be great

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,480
and having a kind of character creator

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,160
that i could have just put into my

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,720
system would have made it easy to make

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,320
custom avatars for everybody the main

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,079
thing i think that the current systems

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,720
are lacking are better cheese plates i

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,480
think

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,240
right now there's not a lot you can do

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,079
in any of the social spaces other than

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,760
walking up and talking to people about

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,680
how neat this social space is

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,040
having more interactive things that you

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,440
can build or

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,320
game like systems speaking of which the

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,760
level design

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,360
is of the spaces needs to encourage

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,120
people to form small groups

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,880
rather than the one big circle where

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,160
only the two most extroverted people

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,320
talk

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,920
so i have tried out a bunch of virtual

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,959
social platforms there's a bunch of them

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,880
out there

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,600
and more are being developed all the

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,800
time i will share these links later

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,279
if you want to know more about this

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,360
topic m laser walker has written a ton

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,200
of really great resources on

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,519
building social platforms like this and

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,240
the design considerations and technical

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,079
problems

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,720
as well as kate compton has some great

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,640
talks on designing for social creativity

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,399
uh you can also go back and read

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,440
gretchen mcculloch's

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,279
talk on cheese plates so thank you very

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,920
much for coming to my talk and maybe i

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:05,680
will see you in a virtual world

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,680
