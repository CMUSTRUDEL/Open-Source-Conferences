	Beware the Dreaded Dead End!! by Richard Schneeman

Nothing stops a program from executing quite as fast as a syntax error. After years of “unexpected end” in my dev life I decided to “do” something about it. I built an over-the-top AI driven solution that finds syntax errors in Ruby code.

Discover why this 100% ridiculous solution was 100% worth-it. Bring your sense of adventure and you’ll walk away with an intro to AI, a short primer on Ruby syntax, and all the friends we made along the way.

Schneems is an open-source junkie that loves community building. He created and maintains CodeTriage.com, a tool for helping people contribute to open-source. When he’s not working on that you might find him building developer tooling at Heroku or working on his own OSS contributions. He is in the top 50 Rails contributors and is an accidental maintainer of Sprockets and Puma. Last time he checked, he had over a 1.2 billion library downloads on RubyGems. When he isn’t obsessively compulsively refactoring code for performance he spends his time reminding his kids to wash their hands.
