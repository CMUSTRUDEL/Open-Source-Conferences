	Oh, no! The Lowest-level* Programming Language is Unicode-aware and I have no excuses?! by  JeanHeyd Meneide

Goodness gracious! It seems like there’s a lot of consternation that the lowest level programming languages and several newer ones do a very poor job of handling Unicode and giving people the means to handle it. And every day, people continue to say things like “only use alphanumeric ASCII letters and numbers for this form” day in and day out. Our names get truncated and filtered. We change ourselves and, for more important matters made digital (banking, flight tickets, and more), we have to reconcile what the computer allows and what people who control our lives see on our official documentation. Is today the day we need to be taken off to the side for a “random, routine inspection”?

Even if people are ratchet in the real world, these systems are digital. They are supposed to be able to do anything we want to, and yet we ended up here. Let’s talk about how we got here, and more importantly,

let’s talk about what we’re doing right now to fix this godawful mess.

* Okay assembly, machine code, stream processing, etc. are all ““lower”” than C but practically speaking, you get what I mean!

They are the Project Editor for the C Language, and they manage their greatest open-source contribution – sol2 – that is used across many industries and academic disciplines. They are currently working towards earning their own nickname, climbing the academic ladder while spending as much time as possible contributing to C++ standardization and development. Their newest and biggest project is Unicode for C++. Learn more about JeanHeyd’s work at their website.

	00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,279
good morning afternoon evening everybody

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,320
thank you very much for that wonderful

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,080
introduction um

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,840
as i said before my name is john hipane

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,720
they run around by the name of phd

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,560
and this is the talk about unicode and

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,240
how i'm sneaking it into the lowest

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,920
level language possible

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,239
um now i see a lowest level language

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,760
possible i i don't necessarily mean

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:37,200
uh like assembly

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,120
you know any of that i'm providing an

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,480
assembly library oh my god that would be

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,840
miserable no so we're talking about c

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,120
we're talking about c this the lingua

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,399
franca that sits beneath almost

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,520
everything connects all the languages

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,640
together and when you talk to see

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,480
you'll be able to talk to everything and

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,440
so that's what we're talking about here

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,760
um that's what we're going for

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,879
so first off i want to give a big thank

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,480
you to

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,160
uh the people who have been who have

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,440
contributed to the presentation

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,520
uh sherpas oasis are hey mohit

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,720
and several patreon sponsors who've kind

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,080
of been supporting open source work and

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,640
kind of helped me get here to the first

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,960
place get

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,159
get here in the first place um super

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,040
glad that all of you contributed to some

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,720
of the sponsors i

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,720
didn't quite get all of you so we got to

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,560
get a bigger picture at some point

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,640
um but that's uh where we're at with

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,600
that but thank you very much to all of

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,720
you

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,960
and now without further ado let's talk

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,080
about c um

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,040
so c is this wonderful language that uh

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,799
has a

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,479
huge reputation for being unsafe and

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,400
terrible and not a lot of people like it

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,520
or a lot of people like it depending on

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,640
who you ask

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,320
uh and whether you like it or you hate

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,479
it it sits beneath everything else

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,600
in your systems right it's how operances

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,880
talk to each other it's how most people

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,759
talk to their operating systems that

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,360
most people

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,399
communicate through one language to

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,079
another right they usually go through a

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,600
c api or something similar right the way

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,000
you talk to python

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,360
um and it's in its virtual machine is

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,159
through c and a bunch of other stuff

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,479
right so this

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,560
is kind of where we're at right now with

00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,840
c

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,200
c has this wonderful thing called low

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,920
californic behavior this is the kind of

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,479
official

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,840
definition it's very you know wordy and

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,960
stuff like that talks about nationality

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,280
and culture and things that come with it

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,560
but

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,720
what you really need to know is that low

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,879
past behavior and specifically locales

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,000
are default configured with the machine

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,520
when you get a machine

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,720
whether it's linux or anything else if

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,319
you ever actually paid attention to when

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,920
you're clicking through the linux uh

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,520
setup screen it asks you about what's

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,720
your you know where do you live uh

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,080
what's your culture what time zone do

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,200
you want to be in right all that stuff

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,879
goes into locale

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,640
and it helps how numbers are formatted

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,640
how things like that are are work

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,640
work because you know the way you format

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,760
a number in germany and in german

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,519
culture is very much different from the

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,319
way formatted in the uk or the united

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,400
states

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,040
um and so all of this goes into local

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,560
specific behavior

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,920
and what this produces very much is kind

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,440
of a local optimum right so if you're in

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,000
germany and you're

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,760
i don't know parsing 3d uh 3d file

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,879
formats like the obj file format right

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,160
and you're parsing a bunch of

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,080
text floats so that you can uh uh

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,400
display you know the bunny or the the

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,120
teacup or you know the cornell room or

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,480
whatever other

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,440
scene you're working on um that has a

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,920
very big form

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,000
right in the way that the uh numbers are

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,840
separated and the way that uh their

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,440
dots and commas and those floating point

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,959
numbers are processed and those decimal

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,519
numbers are processed

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,879
um and so if you're on your machine and

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,480
you never leave your machine

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,040
everything kind of works more or less

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,480
the way you'd expect

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,920
one of the fun things about locales that

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,519
also comes with encoding right so the

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,680
way you interpret characters

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,440
as they come through your text files or

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,720
other streams or whatever else

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,560
has significant codings on them right

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,920
there's a dozen in the early days we're

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,599
over a hundred

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,080
these days there's so many more this is

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,440
just a small sampling from wikipedia

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,879
uh all the red is the stuff they haven't

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,319
even managed to document yet that's how

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,000
much stuff there is

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,120
um but basically this situation right we

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,319
have a bunch of text encodings and

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,159
they're tied to the locale and it's like

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,599
yeah i can work finely in my language

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,280
and what i want to work on

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,480
um and there are over 200 of them now

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,360
yes and everyone can speak their own

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,239
language and it's great and it's

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,760
wonderful

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,159
and now we have to share and talk to

00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,519
other people and

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,200
now we have to share and talk to other

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,519
people

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,879
so you know this is a very interesting

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,640
situation where we've kind of

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,159
clowned ourselves we've made a tower

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,480
babel situation where

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,159
um we have a bunch of machines they all

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,519
output numbers and things like that in

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,720
different formats they all

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,799
have different ways of formatting text

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,840
of understanding the bytes in the stream

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,000
in order to make text

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,000
you know with you know a resume with the

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,479
e uh with the accent mark and everything

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,720
else

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,520
um and so that all kind of helps things

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,960
uh fall apart a little bit unfortunately

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,560
um and so i mean well it's like well it

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,520
can't be that bad right you know how how

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,800
bad is it really

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,080
and i mean we have things like utf-8

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,840
there's this thing wonderful including

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,199
that encompasses more than just a couple

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,479
of languages in fact this whole point is

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,680
accomplished all languages that's what

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,759
unicode and

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,960
utf-8 with unicode transformation format

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,880
eight for eight bits

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,040
um and you can see from this graph like

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,639
we're basically up to about

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,000
seven percent uh uh uh uh utf-8

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,320
penetration on the web right

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,320
so like if we have this utf-8 thing and

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,680
it's able to handle all languages right

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,000
and we can handle emojis and we can

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,680
understand them now do we really need to

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,800
worry about these legacy encodings these

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,479
other you know all these other things in

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,039
the list that barely have two percent or

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,680
even

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,360
uh uh one percent share uh um

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,600
individually amongst them

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,960
um and it turns out you know people

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,639
think the problem is solve right that if

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,000
we just use utf8 everywhere we'll get

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,520
what we need to do and it just

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,639
everything's fine right and that you

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,320
don't need to really worry about as long

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,479
as you see utf-8 it's great and whatever

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,440
else

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,600
right um this is a package this is a

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,199
package coming from paris

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,440
heading to somewhere in russia and as

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,800
you can see if you watch robin spears

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,520
talk earlier this week

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,160
you would have seen a thing called moji

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,160
bake

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,800
and mojibake is this wonderful thing

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,639
where text is taken in as one encoding

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,240
and interpreted as that of coding but

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,360
it's the wrong encoding so everything

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,400
that comes out on your screen comes out

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,759
as garbage right

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,520
and so what you have here is that there

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,080
are people who basically have

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,880
experienced so much moji bake in their

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,240
life

00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,280
post office workers right people you

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,880
don't think you know when you think

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,440
about locale and texans c

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,360
standard who have to hand translate the

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,720
moji bake that comes on the screen

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,639
and that comes into their packages

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,800
because they need to fix

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,720
uh the nightmare that's been presented

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,160
to them that french post office workers

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,360
don't quite understand as much bucky

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,720
just think that's the way you write

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,400
russia which is not the way you write

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,880
russian but that's how it appears to

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,400
them

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,840
right so if somebody has to go in with a

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,160
red pen or whatever else and correct all

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,759
this garbage right

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,520
it also infects other things right you

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,039
think that the internet would kind of be

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,120
ready for this right i just showed you a

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,160
slide where like 97.6

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,800
by april 2021 is where all

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,520
the the the the the number of websites

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,319
that had

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,520
uh utf f8 support right unicode support

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,080
right for emojis and whatever else and

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,600
yet

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,160
we have the internet

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,639
an international standards organization

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,080
that can't handle names with

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,080
accents in them right so

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,240
did we really solve the problem are we

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:02,160
really there yet have we actually

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,759
conquered the beast here um and of

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,880
course we have even more hilarious

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,720
stories right

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,960
the fact that the gov the german

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,960
government who's

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,039
it's it's their language right that has

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,639
umlauts right it's it's their language

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,080
it's it's native to them they that's the

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,520
way that's one of the primary reasons

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,960
why we have it in unico where we where

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,759
we are able to have um lots where we

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,360
speak it

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:25,840
and the german government can't even

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,840
handle

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:32,400
the names of their own native people

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,400
right like

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,440
so have we actually successfully

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,880
conquered have we gotten over locales

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,080
have we managed to fix

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,360
this problem of all the different

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,840
machines being able to talk to each

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,840
other and handle different kinds of data

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,440
okay so it's bad right it's kind of bad

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,280
so how do we fix this mess how do we

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,039
make it so that these these things work

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,720
out for us right to the point where we

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,639
can actually do work on them

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,000
well it turns out that there aren't a

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,560
lot of utilities

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,759
in the c and c square standards c c

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,479
suppose include c by

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,240
you know the c library by reference um

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,000
there's not a lot in c that actually

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,599
is there to fix this right they have a

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,680
bunch of functions and stuff to handle

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,680
specific things but they don't really go

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,800
any further than that so what i did is

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,199
that about

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,720
three years ago um or two years ago at

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,240
this point um i had been working on it

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,479
for three years but about two years ago

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,000
at this point two years and some change

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,280
i sent an email basically to

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,160
a man named uh rajan bhakta and

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,159
he sits on the pl22.16 uh he's one of

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,279
the pl22.16 chairs and he's basically

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,800
sits on the seat committee and so i

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,399
bombard him with emails like listen

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,479
i need to fix this right like i can't

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,680
deal with uh the default locale on some

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,479
of these machines and everything else

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,680
not being

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,480
utf-8 not being able to handle uh a

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,680
majority of texts in the world right so

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,279
that's why i started i just sent him an

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,880
email called turkey i wasn't i wasn't

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,000
the protector at this time i had no idea

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,680
what i was doing i just

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,680
i just had to fix it right i couldn't

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,560
wait any longer so i just i sent him a

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,160
cold email

00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,279
and from there it began to snowball

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,360
right so i hit the ground running and i

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,279
gave a talk at cppcon about

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,360
the way we're going to add unicode to c

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,440
plus plus and inevitably to see

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,920
in order to make this stuff work right

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,519
so the idea is that you know if i can

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,440
fix these low-level languages if i can

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,959
get unicode into these little languages

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,839
then i can start fixing things myself

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,519
right then we can

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,959
enable these governments these these

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,519
people these these these post office

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,839
workers

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,279
to have an experience that isn't

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,720
burdened burdened down

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,160
in legacy for a million years because

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,760
somebody says oh well we can't really

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,720
deal with anything outside of ascii or

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,640
latin one

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,240
or or you know we can't handle hebrew or

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,080
anything else like that right

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,760
um and so i just kept running and so i

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,040
finally built a library that would

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,399
proving out some of the standards work

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,959
that i was doing to show that it was

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,480
possible

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,000
and i kept going and kept going and kept

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,440
going and and

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,800
i have to keep fighting right so this is

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,080
these are the fun these this is a kind

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,600
of a diagram of some of the functions

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,240
you get for converting between one kind

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,440
of

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,640
character to another you can see there's

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,279
a lot of red here and a lot of empty

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,200
space here

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,640
showing that it's not implemented and i

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,160
finally after a lot of struggling

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,120
finally start proposing and fix some of

00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,240
this and stuff some of the stuff

00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,440
actually might make it into the c

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,480
standard at some point

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,040
and so you're struggling and you're

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,240
fighting you're doing all this work and

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,760
and succeeding well the thing is it's

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,040
still kind of a work in progress

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,399
um and while my goal is to make sure to

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,640
technical excuses there can still be

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,600
other excuses and so

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,360
what what i want to to to really

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,480
emphasize is that while i'm

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,760
working on getting unicode into the

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,200
local languages and make sure there's no

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,720
more technical excuses

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,480
there's still people who think that oh

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,839
we can support latin but not hebrew or

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,519
we can support this language but not

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,959
maybe chinese or japanese

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,640
and so there's a lot more work that

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,360
needs to be done even on

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,120
the global right where you have much

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,839
more larger state nations in nation

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,360
states

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,560
um that refuse to allow things like

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,360
accident marks and names everything else

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,240
and so

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,079
there's a lot more to be done and will i

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,560
succeed will we make it

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,279
i mean a little bit open-ended but

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,839
hopefully

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,399
by the time this is all done we'll we'll

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,680
get to a place where

00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,839
everybody's names can be spelled

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,200
correctly everybody's passwords can be

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,920
handled nobody gets stopped for random

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,600
inspection

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,120
by the tsa because what's printed on

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,760
their past because the computer couldn't

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
handle it

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,800
doesn't match their actual idea from

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,079
their country and stuff like that

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,920
well that's hopefully what we're going

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,680
to be going for here and

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,040
hopefully the next time i give a talk

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,680
like this i've been being conor

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,040
somewhere else

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,480
it'll be talking about success in the

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,040
way that we finally managed to fix this

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,560
problem

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,600
and stop mingling and ruining people's

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,600
names and lives and days

00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,600
