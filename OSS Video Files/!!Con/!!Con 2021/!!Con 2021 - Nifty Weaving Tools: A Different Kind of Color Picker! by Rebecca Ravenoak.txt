	Nifty Weaving Tools: A Different Kind of Color Picker! by Rebecca Ravenoak

This talk is about a suite of online weaving tools that speed up and simplify the process of designing woven fabrics. Weaving is a slow process, and there’s nothing as crushing as spending twenty hours on a project and then discovering, at the very end, that the colors actually don’t work well together and the finished fabric is downright ugly. The tools I built solve that problem: how can I predict the final appearance of a woven piece without spending tons of time and money making samples.

Rebecca is a full stack developer and an artist, sometimes both at the same time. They live near Oakland with a small herd of cats and their spouse.
