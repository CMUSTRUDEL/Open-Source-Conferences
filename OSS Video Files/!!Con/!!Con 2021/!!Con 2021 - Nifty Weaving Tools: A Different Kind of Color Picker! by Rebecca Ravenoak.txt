	Nifty Weaving Tools: A Different Kind of Color Picker! by Rebecca Ravenoak

This talk is about a suite of online weaving tools that speed up and simplify the process of designing woven fabrics. Weaving is a slow process, and there’s nothing as crushing as spending twenty hours on a project and then discovering, at the very end, that the colors actually don’t work well together and the finished fabric is downright ugly. The tools I built solve that problem: how can I predict the final appearance of a woven piece without spending tons of time and money making samples.

Rebecca is a full stack developer and an artist, sometimes both at the same time. They live near Oakland with a small herd of cats and their spouse.

hi

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,320
hello everyone um this is a different

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,880
talk obviously

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,600
uh this is about a color picker i built

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,720
for

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,920
uh weaving so let's get into it

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,400
hello this is me uh and my loom who is

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,480
from the late 1930s she's really big and

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,600
really old and i love her so much

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,399
i started weaving in 2013 uh on this

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,399
loom

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,239
because it seemed like a good fit for me

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,879
and my other yarn collecting hobbies

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,800
um it's gone pretty well since then

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,640
weaving it was really interesting to me

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,600
because it has a long in history

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,520
intertwined with

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,039
the history of computers however that's

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,960
not what this talk is about

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,039
um this talk is about the decisions that

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,360
go into a piece of fabric that i make

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,520
uh and how i use computers to help me

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,199
make them

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,680
so what is weaving i don't expect

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,760
literally anyone to know what weaving is

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,600
weaving is the process of making fabric

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,960
using a loom the loom will hold

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,640
the lengthwise warp threads taut

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,400
and it can raise and lower them so that

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,320
the weaver can pass the weft threads

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,600
uh over and under the warp threads

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,680
forming the structure

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,280
of the fabric i'm gonna talk a lot about

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,400
warp and weft in this talk

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,159
you don't need to know anything else

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,520
about weaving for the most part it helps

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,000
to remember that wefts

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,360
go from left to right uh and warps with

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,040
ones to go up and down

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,960
so in the piece on the right that you

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,280
see it has a white warp

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,240
that's almost entirely covered by the

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,840
black and yellow weft

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,360
that means the piece is left dominant

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,840
because you mostly only see the weft but

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,840
other

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,280
pieces of fabric can be warped dominant

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,079
or most of them are balanced which means

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,399
you can see both

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,240
the warp and the weft at the same time

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,600
which is you know useful

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,880
so a little story about these towels

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,360
as a weaver one of the things that

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,280
fascinates me is the series of decisions

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,960
that go into every piece of cloth like

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,280
why are things the way they are

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,680
weaving is a really complex process and

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,520
50 or more of the work that goes into my

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,720
weaving is planning and setup

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,080
making good decisions is really

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,200
important because like you know if you

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,400
make a bad decision it sort of

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,000
propagates through

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,680
um the part that we think about as

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,560
weaving where you know there's a weaver

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,599
sitting and like

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,879
doing the thing with the loom and

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,560
throwing the shuttle back and forth

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,280
that's the second to last step in the

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,120
process

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,200
before i even touch my loom i have to

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,120
decide what i am making

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,200
and what makes this project successful

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,040
so like what yarn do i use what

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,440
structure suits my goals

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,800
i have to think about how it will behave

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,480
while i'm leaving and also

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,400
afterwards when it's a piece of cloth

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,560
that i'm using some decisions are really

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,319
easy like don't make wool towels

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,000
but others are really tricky like what

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,560
colors do i use in these towels that i'm

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,200
giving to

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,400
somebody else color choices can be

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,599
really hard

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,280
because you have to think about how the

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,080
colors will blend and they like to

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,640
surprise you

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,840
the towels you see over there are my

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,920
least favorite project

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,280
probably i thought the purple and brown

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,480
would be really pretty together

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,080
and they look really bad in person

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,680
most people that work with color have

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,800
experienced this where the colors look

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,680
good separately blended

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,519
into icky mud so you can solve this the

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,280
traditional weaving way to do that is to

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,879
make a bunch of samples and inspect them

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,280
and then make your decisions

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,000
but that's pretty slow and boring and

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,599
can be expensive

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,200
if your yarn is really expensive and it

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,440
doesn't always work

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,640
so a lot of people don't like making

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,879
samples i don't

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,239
clearly uh making these horrible towels

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,040
didn't stop me from leaving but it did

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,879
make me kind of

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,560
cautious about colors a couple years ago

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,680
after or a couple years after i made

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,560
those towels which was also a couple

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,319
years ago

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,680
i signed up for a weaving class that

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,599
promised you could weave

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,080
a whole set of coordinated kitchen

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,159
textiles so you know towels aprons

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,760
placemats table runners napkins pot

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,440
holders rugs

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,720
anything you want to use in the kitchen

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,360
uh and you only have to set up your

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,879
lumens

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,120
and they will do most of the work for

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,120
you right that sounds incredible

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,319
50 of my time goes into planning and

00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,840
setup so like

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,840
if i can go someplace where they take

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,120
care of that for me i have twice as much

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,480
weaving time

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,560
and then this is what i came home with

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,840
after four days of weaving i made nine

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,519
yards of fabric which was

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,760
honestly kind of a cool personal record

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,120
for me um i learned a lot about the

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,159
decisions you can make while you're

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,079
weaving so like

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,000
you can change your your colors you can

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,199
change the texture of the fabric

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,519
but i also learned a lot about how

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,560
making good decisions up front

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,560
really changes uh the the quality of

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,639
your final project

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,000
the class was coming up uh they sent me

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,600
this image which is

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,960
some yarn wrapped around a ruler it's

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,240
like a quick and easy way to make a

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,919
sample but without doing

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,840
any actual weaving but you do have to

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,600
have all of the yarns on hand which is

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,040
fine if you're a weaving store and not

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,639
great if you are a person who lives in a

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,400
small apartment

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,759
based on this design i had to pick the

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,880
colors i wanted to use

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,240
from the 76 colors this yarn comes in

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,680
so there's five separate colors there's

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,680
76 possibilities that's 2.2 trillion

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,520
opportunities to make really really ugly

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,600
towels and i was terrified

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,880
obviously like that's that's an

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,919
intimidating amount of

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,639
choices but here's what i did i built a

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,479
color picker

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,840
using the product images for this yarn

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,320
off of the school website

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,840
there are literally divs with background

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,919
images and a little form that lets me

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,520
change the color code in the image urls

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,039
it sounds totally cheap and

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,800
botched together and it is and it

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,400
totally worked uh

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,919
i picked out my colors and i shared the

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,479
tool with my classmates

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,479
and they loved it and that's kind of

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,880
where i expected this project to end

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,400
but it didn't this was a huge hit with

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,960
my classmates and the staff at the

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,479
school

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,400
they asked if i would be up for building

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,400
a more general purpose stripe tool and

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,240
of course i was like that's what i do

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,080
my janky demo with one stripe pattern

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,400
and one yarn turned into a whole web app

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,840
with

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,600
a color palette and multiple types of

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,400
yarn and stripe patterns and a huge log

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,960
of backlog

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,720
product requests right like that's

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,560
that's success in software like

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,320
you have people using it who want more

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,400
and so you're like yes i did it i'm

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,319
so powerful when the pandemic hit and

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,360
classes had to shut down uh we started

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,440
stress testing it

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,880
testing it with kits that people could

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,720
design and weave at home

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,479
that was all great but there was one

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,120
piece missing

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,720
remember how colors like to surprise you

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,160
so the problem with these towels wasn't

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,319
that the purple and brown

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,240
looked bad next to each other but that

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,160
they blended in a really gross way

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,280
so the top half of this picture you can

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,199
see what they look like

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,120
unwoven just like stripes next to each

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,000
other but the bottom half shows you what

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,720
it looks like

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,199
once you start passing the left back and

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
forth

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,120
the brown stripes stand out a lot

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,600
because the the yarns are the same color

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,360
so they kind of reinforce each other but

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,680
the purple stripes kind of fade into

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,880
this

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,000
this weird funky horribleness my stripe

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,160
tool could have shown me

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,919
the unwoven stripes and i might have

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,199
made better decisions based on that

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,840
but it wouldn't have told me what the

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,160
final cloth would look like

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,240
so hasn't anyone solved this already

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,880
right weaving has been around for 8 000

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,360
years

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,360
somebody at some point you know probably

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,840
between the advent of computers and now

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,520
should have

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,680
you know figured out how to deal with

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,759
this and they kind of have there's a

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,080
whole category of software for weavers

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,680
called weaving software

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,840
that's used to design cloth and

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,440
optionally control computer driven looms

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,360
you can do really cool things with it

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,560
however is expensive it has a steep

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,400
learning curve

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,840
and is not designed for picking colors

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,280
this is fiberworks which is a very

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,759
popular and feature which

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,479
rich weaving software suite which i use

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,160
personally

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,720
and its color palette is almost as good

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,960
as ms paint like how do you even get

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,400
accurate colors using this you don't you

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,560
can with some work

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,000
uh find an accurate rgb color for a

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,919
given yarn then input it

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,759
and use it in your design and if you're

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,080
really dedicated you might convert all

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,240
76 colors of this yarn to rgb

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,599
and enter those and redo that every time

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,120
you want to make a new project

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,759
and that's terrible i've done it once

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,440
it's just don't nobody does this

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,879
what actually happens is that people

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,759
pick colors that are close enough and

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,160
hope for the best

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,720
and it's a great way to be surprised

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,720
usually in a bad way

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,160
but unlike fiberworks we have a color

00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,360
palette that works for us it's built

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,360
into the stripe tool

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,039
it's specific to one kind of yarn but

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,960
that's how yarn actually works

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,960
you either buy it from a company with a

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,160
large range of consistent colors or you

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,440
dye it yourself

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,199
people who dye their own yarn are

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,240
generally pretty happy with surprises

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,199
because it kind of comes with the

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,240
territory

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,919
um but the rest of us uh tend to just

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,039
buy our yarn and that's a

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,720
pretty big group of people honestly so

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,160
people who buy yarn online are already

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,080
familiar with these pallets because

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,520
that's how yarn is sold like you pick

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,120
one of these swatches when you're buying

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,399
yarn you don't like tell them

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,719
i just want red so the flexibility of

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,599
uh that's built into fiber works with

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,320
you know its

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,919
complete rgb color system actually works

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,039
against them because very few people

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,560
actually want to

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:47,760
convert these swatches into rgb colors

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,040
it's it's just not fun so we have

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,560
everything we need right like we've got

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,640
the color palette that works

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,560
and we have you know enough html to be

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,399
dangerous so we can have weaving

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,800
software with really accurate colors and

00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,360
it's

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,120
pretty straightforward so some quick

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,480
background more about weaving this is

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,519
what a weaving draft

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,080
looks like the bars on the bottom and on

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,000
the right

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,000
have weaving instructions and the large

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,279
center section shows you what the woven

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,600
cloth will look like

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,360
every pixel in the center represents one

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,640
thread crossing over another and

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,560
whatever thread on top

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,320
is the one that's visible it's a fun

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,560
logic to do one

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,519
it's a fun logic puzzle to make one of

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,360
these by hand

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,519
but obviously it's a lot faster to have

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,680
a computer build it for you

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,360
the strike tool used divs because that

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,320
was good enough but this requires more

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,000
complexity

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,560
and that's where svg comes in if you're

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,160
not familiar with svg it's just a tool

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,640
that lets you draw based on coordinates

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,959
like

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,200
draw a rectangle that's 100 by 200

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,839
starting at some specific point

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,240
the skeleton of the draft we can draw

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,160
you know

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,640
based on those rectangles and then the

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,399
colors are defined by patterns

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,560
you can describe your warp and your weft

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,519
stripe with patterns in svg

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,200
and then make a mask that describes the

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,519
texture of the cloth based on

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,800
the weaving instructions that you can

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,560
see in the draft

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,120
if the warp thread should be on top then

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,800
the mask will let the warp color

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,560
through or it will cover it with the

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,200
weft color just like the way fabric

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,560
works

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,399
to change the colors you only have to

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,839
change the warp or the weft pattern

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,079
which is great because that's

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,360
computationally very cheap uh if you're

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,120
editing it and you're changing the

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,800
weaving instructions all you have to do

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,560
is you know recompute and redraw that

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,279
section of the mask and it's still like

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,320
pretty fast to do in the browser which i

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,640
think was

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,720
my initial biggest concern about this

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,000
like is it gonna be performant and no it

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,160
was

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,839
so i wanna i wanna end by showing you

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,680
the kind of power this tool has

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,600
these are all the same design in

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,200
different colors the staff

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,800
at the eating school was really really

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,480
excited for this and they made a whole

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,680
series of designs based on celestial

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,760
bodies and i think

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,720
they're incredible um some of the colors

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,360
are super subtle so

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,000
others are very contrasty and it's all

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,160
possible

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,560
because computers and weaving are best

00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,880
friends like peanut butter and chocolate

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,920
and so that's it i want to say thank you

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,200
to the club

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,279
the staff at the school and my

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,959
classmates for all of their ideas

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,480
and inspiration and feedback and bug

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,560
reports i couldn't deal with

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,640
it without them and without the backup

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,720
of my weaving community in general

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,040
thank you all for you know coming to my

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,279
talk and hanging out and i'll be around

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,720
on discord to answer any other questions

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,720
you have about weaving

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,880
or literally anything else it's been

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,880
