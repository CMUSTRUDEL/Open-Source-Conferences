	pwintln!(): teaching an ELF to uwu!! by Jade Fink

Linux programs can print output in uwu-speak, but they either need to have their output filtered after the fact, or need to use special functions to output such text. This is clearly unacceptable! I should be able to include an uwuifier library so all my program’s output is uwuified, nyowo mattew whewe it came fwowom!!

I will show the learning process from idea to minimal prototype of a text uwuifier that, with one function call, inserts itself into its process using tricks from binary exploitation for ironically benign purposes. I figure out how the dynamic linker resolves function calls to the system C library and redirect them for my own nefarious purposes by fooling around with a debugger!
