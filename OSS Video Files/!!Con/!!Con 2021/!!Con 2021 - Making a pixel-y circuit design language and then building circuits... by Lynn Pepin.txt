	Making a pixel-y circuit design language and then building circuits in it!! by Lynn Pepin

Have you ever made a complicated Redstone machine in Minecraft, graphed out a complicated boolean expression, or taken a philosophy or digital-logic-design course? If so, then you’re probably familiar with the ORs, XORs, and ANDs of digital logic circuits!! From these basic elements, one can build layer upon layer of abstraction.

In this talk, I’ll introduce Reso, an esoterical graphical logic circuit design language. It is inspired by Piet, Conway’s Game of Life, and Redstone. Reso programs are circuits defined by bitmaps, where components are inherently modular and can be copy-and-pasted with ease. Your favorite graphics editor (be it GIMP, Paint, or Photoshop) is your IDE and the world (er, bitmap) is your oyster!!

In this talk, you’ll see what a circuit looks like, you’ll see how it works, and you’ll see the execution of one of these bitmap circuits!!

Lynn is a software engineer, a data scientist, and a big fan of interpreted and interactive languages. During COVID times, they became enthusiastic about aromatic brewed beverages and about taking nature walks while sipping said beverages. They spend the rest of their time making digital art, videogames, and poorly-done crochet.
