	Save Icons! In Real Life?! (My Love of the Floppy Disk!) by wilkie

Have you ever seen that image next to “Save” and thought “what the heck is that?!” Or perhaps you’re nostalgic for the era of “Please Insert Disk 18.” Either way, in 10 minutes, we will all be experts in that plastic card with a magnetic personality: the floppy disk! We will go over their history and construction and how, exactly, do simple magnets store information. And if you think we can’t use these real life save icons to create modern art, well, I have a hidden surprise for you!!

wilkie is a systems programmer, wannabe archivist, and not a proper noun! I do research and development of federated systems for software preservation and archival, focused on scientific software and replicability.

okay

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,119
hello um here we go

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,960
first lesson for you about the floppy

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,279
disks that everyone loves them

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,320
dogs love them cats love them and of

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,199
course

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,680
rookies love them i have thousands of

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,640
them

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,679
i i enjoy archiving them preserving them

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,680
i think we don't

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,719
think about how to preserve floppy disks

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,320
enough and

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,920
exactly how to do it so i'd like to

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,760
change that but

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,760
in the meantime i'm going to share my

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,960
love of the floppy disk and

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,280
kind of how it works and what's

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,360
interesting about it first thing is just

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:52,079
like human beings it comes with

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,160
a variety of beautiful shapes and sizes

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,079
the 3.5 inch disc is probably what you

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,440
mostly think of about a floppy disk but

00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,920
it comes in a five

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,879
and a quarter inch and of course the big

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,199
chunk itself

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,040
the eight inch discs a little bit big on

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,439
my my taste i have no idea but

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,080
for the original disc was eight inches

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,680
just oh

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,479
already common size if you ever seen one

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,240
um

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,759
so what's interesting about these they

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,000
all work the same way they're all

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,759
different sizes but they all effectively

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,200
are the same technology which i think is

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,200
really cool

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,280
history lesson here this computer just

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,920
like me is from 1987

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,119
it's twelve hundred dollars and it has

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,439
no no hard drive

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,040
because that would be too expensive a

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,479
hard drive would require a card and the

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,920
drive itself you're talking another

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,799
thousand bucks

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,600
and the thing is it has embossed two

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,079
floppy drives

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,720
instead now they're both five and a

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,240
quarter inch

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,240
you put your software you run it from

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,720
one you put a blank in the other to save

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,720
it

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,720
and that was so common for a stretch of

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,720
time that to this day

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,320
it is our visual metaphor for saving

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,600
that's our save icon for you because

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,640
that's literally

00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,640
all you would have to to save on so

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,479
interesting i this save icon is from

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,280
powerpoint and i probably stared at this

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,799
thing for

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,479
months at a time i i'm sick of it

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,920
and even though we had that era where

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,360
floppy disks were basically the

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,760
exclusive way we

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,120
shared information they became obsolete

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,840
quite quickly

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,520
um and it's pretty easy to see why doom

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,480
came on four disks

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,000
doom 2 came on 5. windows 3.1 came on

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,800
six and windows 95

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,200
13. office had the option of coming on

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,480
24 or even 30 floppy disks

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,920
and yet all these discs versus one cd

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,879
who would win

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,519
the cd would win handily 1.5 megabyte

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,160
floppy disks here a cd can hold over 500

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,680
of them

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,000
no contest as soon as people had this

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,959
there is no more floppy disk goodbye

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,440
speaking of

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,120
being doomed make sure you check out

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,080
phil and kimmy's talks by the way i just

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,160
want to plug them

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,120
doom's been referenced a lot here and i

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,680
am so happy about it

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,080
uh so what's cool about floppy disk of

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,200
course is how it actually stores data

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,640
um so how do you get binary data onto

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,519
your disk here well uh

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,280
the answer is simple you use magnets how

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,920
does that work

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,080
well first let's talk about the physical

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,560
nature of a disk now the 3.5 inch

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,200
is a rigid disc it's got a plastic shell

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,200
and

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,799
it's still floppy because the inside

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,360
right the flexible material

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,640
here is a magnetic material yeah it

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,720
flops around

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,799
and it's usually some sort of ferrous

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,720
thing like iron oxide cobalt

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,120
barium ferrite doesn't really matter as

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,799
long as it keeps a magnetic field right

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,560
this is going to be subdivided into

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,599
cylindrical regions called tracks

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,680
and each of those are going to be

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,599
divided into sectors

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,040
the disk drive itself it has a magnetic

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,000
head and its only responsibility

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,239
mechanically

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,319
is to seek to the right sector it does

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,239
that by rotating the disk of course

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,360
and selecting the track by a lateral

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,760
motion

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,360
with a little motor on it that moves the

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,319
magnetic head up and down

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,799
now the thing about that that you uh i

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,879
want to

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,319
appreciate is the sound that it makes i

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,760
think i could go to sleep listening to

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,080
the sound of floppy disks

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,080
uh floppy drives because they are just

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,319
they have this mechanical sound

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,160
which just never gets old i miss it

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,799
honestly

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,519
all right so digging down into this we

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,639
can see

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,680
um how we would represent the um

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,800
the magnetic information basically the

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,040
discs

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,720
are magnetic fields and they're going to

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,280
represent pockets of

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,800
information by the change in polarity so

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,560
if we can represent this by a bunch of

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,639
bar magnets lined up

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,400
when the polarity changes that's a one

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,759
and when it stays the same that's a zero

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,759
you can imagine how this would work

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,600
you're holding a magnet in your hand

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,199
you're close your eyes and you're you're

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,560
hovering over these magnets

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,320
and whenever you feel the attraction

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,600
repulsion whenever that changes that's

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,280
going to be a one to you

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,880
and whenever you don't sense anything

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,720
that's a zero

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,320
and in the ideal world this is enough we

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,360
have a bite of information

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,280
eight bits uh that's great

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,479
except we live in this thing called

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,240
reality

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,240
and it never likes us to have nice

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,520
things which is a shame really

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,080
so there's a problem with this um

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,919
and the problem is if i asked you to

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,520
snap your fingers every second

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,960
and then ask somebody else you both do

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,320
it a different way

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,160
because you have a different internal

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,400
understanding of how long a second is

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,160
that's true here writing a disk on one

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,080
drive does not necessarily transfer it

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,960
to another very well

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,479
basically long stretches of zeros are a

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,400
problem because if we're closing our

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,639
eyes and hovering over them

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,320
we don't sense any change and for a

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,720
length of time how many

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,360
zeros how many magnets underneath was

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,080
that two

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,280
three four five it's not it's not

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,840
apparent

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,840
so how do we solve that well the same

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,520
way i would solve it if you know you and

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,639
i were snapping our fingers and we want

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,520
it to synchronize

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,639
we keep some sort of clock a metronome a

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,360
tapping foot

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,039
right something like some conductor here

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,120
is in the background making sure that we

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,680
play the notes at the same time

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,680
so what we can do is very simple we can

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,319
make sure there's always a polarity

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,479
change

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,520
some attraction repulsion change we can

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:16,240
we can tell with our magnet

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,880
and we can have that exist at a regular

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,080
rate

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,160
so we always sense it within the data so

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,720
we can take our data zero zero one zero

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,400
is our

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,800
our data that we're encoding and we'll

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,560
insert a one in between by switching the

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,680
polarity underneath

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,280
and now we basically can sense that that

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,880
beat the tapping of our foot

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,400
whenever we sense a delay that's a zero

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,080
and a one otherwise

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,600
so we ensure there's at least one change

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,280
of magnetism for every bit

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,960
this is called frequency modulation and

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,960
coding in the

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,240
array in chalkers here that's what they

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,000
did um

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,479
and that was pretty good it's naive but

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,080
it works if we look at the wave produced

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,599
we see a square wave here where every

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,599
vertical line is a one

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,520
that's the thing we can sense what's our

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,479
problem is the horizontal line that gets

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,560
too long

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,720
uh then we start to lose track of what

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,400
it is

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,960
what's really really fascinating to me

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,960
is there's dozens of ways to do this

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,400
with the same exact technology here

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,360
there are dozens of ways to represent

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,120
information

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,800
that's one our tapping of the foot

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,800
another thing we can think about is

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,360
allowing our clock or our tapping of our

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,319
foot to rest let it be a zero

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,800
because the only thing we're really

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,599
worried about is interrupting series of

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,280
zeros

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,120
we can just insert a one in there with

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,199
our clock bit whenever we

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,280
sense a series of zeros so if we have

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,039
two zeros that are in our data we put a

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,840
one in between otherwise we can have the

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,000
clock be

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,520
a zero we don't have to tap our foot

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,520
because the data

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,919
is doing that for us there's a note

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,000
being played that we can synchronize on

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,199
in this simple change of just putting

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,680
the one in between zeros

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,080
called modified fm encoding it ensures

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,240
that at most one polarity changes

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,919
per bit and we get this curve this is

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,160
the same exact date as before

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,599
but our curve is a lot it's a lot

00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,080
smoother right there's a lot less

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,520
vertical

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:04,080
lines the less the better honestly

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,120
um so this is just a very simple change

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,599
and we can say

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,879
we can see the different waves here side

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,599
by side

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,000
and we have you know a simpler wave now

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,319
what you

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,680
might be thinking is what improvement

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,039
was actually made we have the same

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,039
amount of information here

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,720
it's the same data it looks like we

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,240
haven't really i mean maybe we're more

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,199
clever but we didn't actually solve a

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,280
problem

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,080
it's easier if we look at the worst case

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,240
which is encoding all ones in both

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,080
and with our tapping foot at the top we

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,800
have a very chaotic

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,440
uh square wave here because we're

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,839
basically

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,440
changing polarity constantly so we have

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,440
this really really rigid like

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,640
square wave here it's very compact in

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,800
our modified

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,760
encoding though we actually allow that

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,920
zero there

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,600
we can never have two ones in a row so

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,959
we never get that that strict square

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,440
wave in fact

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,519
um it's it's always our worst case it's

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,600
going to be just twice as efficient

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,800
and the thing about this is we have to

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,440
change our brain a little bit

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,640
if we can handle the top square wave but

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,320
we never have it

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,399
what can we do one of two things this

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,360
enables we can spin our disc twice as

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,760
fast

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,360
or we can store twice as much stuff in

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,160
the same space just from our simple

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,920
change

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,360
which is why we call this single versus

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,120
double density i

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,080
i just find that's really fascinating

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,160
it's a very cool change

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,440
it's it's bizarre to me that you can

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,279
make that small little change

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,640
how it works and have drastic

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,160
differences you know you can fit twice

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,399
as much stuff on this thing

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,360
that's really fascinating and i want to

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,800
end on

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,200
visualization of the flux so um the flux

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,959
is

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,560
the flux visualization here we're seeing

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,839
the magnetic field across the entire

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,920
disk we're zooming out

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,000
and we see all three of these different

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,560
os's do different things on the floppy

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
disk

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,839
they all have different strategies for

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,880
how they store information i find that

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,200
fascinating

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,920
um there's no like best or worst thing

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,839
here

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,760
but they all do it a different way and

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,240
it makes you think right

00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,519
if you can store the flux in different

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,839
patterns like this

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,560
why can't you store it in a strategic

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,279
way

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,560
to paint whatever picture you want can i

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,959
hide information on this

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,079
absolutely i can put a picture of this

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,600
my password here

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,200
i give you this floppy disk it's not

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,720
going to read on a normal machine

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,240
hook it up to an oscilloscope though and

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,519
you'll see this image a little bit of

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,040
stenography

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,200
make sure you check out williams talk

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,200
and sonography later on

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,120
uh and if you can do that then you can

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,880
put any image you want on it i think the

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,959
bang bang con logo is a perfect

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,640
opportunity to be used here and now we

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,200
have a little bit of art i think this is

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,800
great

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,480
every nothing is obsolete if you can

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,920
make art out of it right

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,519
uh maybe that'll be true about me

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,040
someday um but

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,560
i think this is fascinating i hope this

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,480
inspires you to look at these old

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,720
technologies a different way as well

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,240
um if you make art with ben's program

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,079
here thank you ben uh

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,440
please send it to me please send me all

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,480
your floppy disks and

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,480
um basically thank you for putting up

00:10:52,480 --> 00:11:00,079
with me

00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,079
