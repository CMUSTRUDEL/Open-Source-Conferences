	Save Icons! In Real Life?! (My Love of the Floppy Disk!) by wilkie

Have you ever seen that image next to “Save” and thought “what the heck is that?!” Or perhaps you’re nostalgic for the era of “Please Insert Disk 18.” Either way, in 10 minutes, we will all be experts in that plastic card with a magnetic personality: the floppy disk! We will go over their history and construction and how, exactly, do simple magnets store information. And if you think we can’t use these real life save icons to create modern art, well, I have a hidden surprise for you!!

wilkie is a systems programmer, wannabe archivist, and not a proper noun! I do research and development of federated systems for software preservation and archival, focused on scientific software and replicability.
