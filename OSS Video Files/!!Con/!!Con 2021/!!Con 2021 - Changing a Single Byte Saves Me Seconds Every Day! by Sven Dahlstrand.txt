	Changing a Single Byte Saves Me Seconds Every Day! by Sven Dahlstrand

Have you ever stumbled upon a piece of software that’s almost perfect? Loving everything about it except that teeny-tiny little detail. Sticking out, like a sore thumb.

For me, that almost-perfect piece of software is Tetris, for the original Game Boy. My grudge? Every time the game boots up, you have to stare at an 8-second long copyright notice before being allowed to play. One summer, during an intense Tetris tournament against my BFF, I got super-duper-feed-up with that notice and asked myself: “Is it possible to hack Tetris and get rid of that screen forever?”

This talk is about saving precious time. But it’s also about friendship, falling blocks, reverse-engineering and hacking games. I hope it will inspire you to look under the hood of software you love and make it even lovelier.
