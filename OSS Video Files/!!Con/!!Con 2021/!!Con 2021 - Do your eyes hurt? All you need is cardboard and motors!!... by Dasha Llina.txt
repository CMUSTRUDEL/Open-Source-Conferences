Description: 
	Do your eyes hurt? All you need is cardboard and motors!! (Ok, and a lot of superglue) by Dasha Llina

The grim reality of working from home has finally entered almost every household. Though even before the pandemic, with the invention of the ‘freelancer’, so came the many gadgets to improve productivity and reduce discomfort from working from home or at an office. My response to the screen glasses, office chairs, or ergonomic mice was to build my own DIY versions with cardboard and a few motors. Did my solutions work? you ask. Sounds like you will need to attend the talk* to find out!

This talk* will give you an insight into how these sort of solutions can be made from the materials you have at home - with basic skills, many failed attempts, and lots of humor - in order to encourage you to build your own fixes to your problems!

Dasha Ilina is a Russian digital artist based in Paris, France. Her work explores the relationship we develop with the digital devices we use on a daily basis, specifically in regards to the human body. Ilina’s work centers around the notions of care and technology, DIY practices and low-tech solutions to examine various issues such as phone addiction, tech-related health problems and privacy in the digital age. She is the founder of the Center for Technological Pain, a center that proposes DIY solutions to health problems caused by digital technologies for which she has received an Honorary Mention at Ars Electronica. She is also the co-director of NØ SCHOOL.

hello everyone my name is dashaylina and

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,960
i'm a digital artist

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,199
originally from moscow in russia and now

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,160
based in paris

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,400
and today i'll be giving this

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,160
presentation that's titled do your eyes

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,880
hurt all you need is cardboard and

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,160
motors

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,519
okay and a lot of super glue and before

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,719
i start this presentation

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,640
i would like to briefly introduce myself

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,239
like i said i'm a digital artist so i

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,000
work a lot with different technologies

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,719
but i also often don't use

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,200
any technology at all in my work and

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,039
what

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,879
really interests me is the way that

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,239
technology actually influences

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,920
our body whether mentally or physically

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,600
and the project that i will present

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,440
today is very much about that

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,719
so this project is called center for

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,480
technological pain

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,320
and i've been working on it for quite

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,159
some time now

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,479
and it's a mock company that i created

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,920
in which i develop diy solutions to

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,240
health problems that come from

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,760
technology

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,600
and the reason why i started working on

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,080
this project was because

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,960
i needed a thesis project to graduate

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,280
and i had

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,479
no ideas and i started looking around

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,080
myself around

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:26,479
my classmates and just other people

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,920
that i saw every day and a lot of people

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,360
were complaining about the different

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,320
problems that they had because of the

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,880
way that they were

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,000
using their devices like whether the way

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,000
that they were sitting or

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,680
standing or looking down at their phone

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,680
and things like that

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,280
and so i decided to start sort of

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,000
sketching ideas for the different

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,799
problems that i was noticing around me

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,520
and different solutions so here you see

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,040
some of these sketches

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,759
those are different things that either i

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,680
experienced or my friends told me about

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,799
and actually the first object that i

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,600
ever built was this

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,000
problem number five the problem being

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,399
that

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,680
uh straining your eyes from staring at

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,840
screens for too long

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,600
and the solution being glasses with

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,800
shades that automatically close

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:14,080
for 10 minutes every hour so here

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,840
you can see the very first object that i

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,000
ever built

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,080
are these glasses and

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,040
at the time i was really bad at physical

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,720
computing and i

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,080
still am pretty bad at physical

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,120
computing but i've gotten

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,959
a little bit better uh so when i

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,640
actually made these classes and when

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,400
they actually worked

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,680
i was very sort of empowering and it

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,959
felt really great

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,840
to realize that i was able to make

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,160
something that

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,920
moves by myself without anyone's help

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,200
but the way that i did it was also

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,640
really stupid

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,920
here you can see all of the failures

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,840
of this project for some reason i

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,440
decided to use two arduinos and i had

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,200
these like massive motors

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,680
attached to very frail plastic glasses

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,120
so obviously they were very heavy and

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,400
they kept falling off of my face

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,360
but despite all of that once i did

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,000
accomplish uh making a video with these

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,200
glasses

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,200
fully functioning it felt

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:26,000
really really good despite the fact that

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,239
you know it's very sort of cheap and diy

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,239
made

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,480
and so once i made this object i decided

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,200
to to

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,480
share it on social media and i got nine

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,080
likes on twitter which

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,000
at the time to me was like amazing um

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,239
and keep in mind that one of those nine

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,920
likes was the official arduino account

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,120
so

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,440
this sort of lit my fire and it

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,159
kind of forced me to keep making these

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,599
objects

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,439
which um now i'm very grateful that i

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,000
kept doing this

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,680
but i also got my first sort of hater

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,720
which also at the time felt really good

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,439
because it meant that

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,640
somebody actually paid attention enough

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,239
to this project

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,920
to have a negative opinion about it so

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,599
this conversation is in french but i

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,479
will quickly translate it

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,440
so panduino said sorry i don't i don't

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,280
see what this is

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,799
to which i said it's a pair of glasses

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,000
that uh

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,280
closes or the glasses close to let your

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,680
eyes

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,680
rest while you're using a computer to

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,000
which panduino said

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,440
could just turn off the screen no and i

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,440
said well you know it's made

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,960
to force people that forget to take a

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,120
break take a break or

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,120
people that forget to move away or close

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,120
their screen

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,639
uh to which they said i think that if i

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,479
had glasses like this

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,720
all the time it would just make me more

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,240
tired than the break would relieve me

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,080
and i said okay well you know it's just

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,680
a prototype in the future the glasses

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,600
would move slowly and they would close

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,759
more like 10 minutes every hour

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,080
to which they said well in any case it's

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,360
art so it's experimental

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,199
um so yeah this was you know this was

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,440
great to me was a success

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,199
i kept making these objects and here's

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,080
another prototype that is called

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,880
pillow for proper positioning so here

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,320
you see

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,440
um it's a fan that is blowing into a

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,840
plastic bag that um sort of

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,560
allows you to to place your wrists in a

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,560
more proper way

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,000
when you're using your laptop and you

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,240
will notice that it is

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,280
connected to a battery so it is portable

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,479
it is light

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,600
and it works okay

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,759
um another object that i'll show you is

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,600
this hands-free headset

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,520
this is actually my favorite object out

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,320
of all the ones that i've made

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,440
and it also shows just how absurd some

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,080
of my solutions were

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,280
it also shows that this is at the end of

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,080
the day an art project

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,160
not a design project so it's not meant

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,800
to be

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,680
super well done and finished and

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,880
beautiful

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,319
it's meant to sort of mock the way

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,960
that we interact with our devices and

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,080
just to which degree we are attached to

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,919
them

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,240
so here you see yes this headset

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,759
in which you can place your phone and

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,520
you don't have to move your neck anymore

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,720
you don't have to use your hands as much

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,759
so it relieves you of your neck pain um

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,639
when you're using your phone but uh at

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,039
the end of the day

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,039
of course it also prevents you from

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:36,240
seeing anything that is in front of you

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:39,360
so is it a success i'd say so

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,240
and while i was working on these objects

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,919
um what i noticed was that actually

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,280
while it was nice to be able to share

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,479
these objects with other people and to

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,639
get their feedback what i

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,319
really enjoyed the most was the actual

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,319
process of making them

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,759
and i think that being in a classroom

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,120
environment really helped with that

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,599
because

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,680
other people were you know suggesting

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,720
other problems that i should work on

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,919
or they were helping me come up with the

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,039
best way to build these sort of

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,599
prototypes

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,440
so i quickly realized that what i really

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:13,360
wanted to do with this project was

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,120
do workshops and so this is one of the

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,240
first workshops that i'd ever done with

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,319
this project

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,840
um it was at le cube which is this art

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,599
center outside of paris

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,240
and this workshop is with teenagers

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,560
between 10 about 15 years old so this is

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,639
actually a 12 year old who built this

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,919
the pro the problem that he wanted to

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,759
tackle the most was

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,599
uh the fact that some people don't know

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,240
about covering their their surveillance

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,039
camera

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,400
or they take it off to do a skype and

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,960
then they forget

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,520
which you know at the time was a pretty

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,759
good

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,639
solution and now is an even better one

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,360
because we're all constantly on zoom

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,160
and so he completely by himself built

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,000
this whole

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,840
thing where you press a button and after

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,360
a certain time the camera

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,800
the shutter closes and that was amazing

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,120
to me

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,199
um another workshop that i did was at

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,599
metamarathon and dusseldorf and so here

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,440
you see

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,520
two other solutions one of them is the

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,080
focus box so it's this

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,240
object that forces you to stay focused

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,360
at your screen and there's even

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,680
sponges by your ears that kind of block

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,080
out

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,479
surrounding sound and on the right you

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,080
see the back painkiller water hat so

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,199
this is the solution against

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,199
hunching it's a box

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,199
that is filled with water that has holes

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,320
in front of it so that when you start

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,760
hunching down

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:39,919
water will pour onto your laptop and

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:42,159
break it and here's the last solution

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,919
from a workshop that i'll show you

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,000
it's also a solution against hunching

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:49,760
and it was done at hackers and designers

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,040
in amsterdam and this is a more

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,760
technological also solution in which

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,120
once you hunch down your computer screen

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,040
turns red

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,399
so it's also like supposed to remind you

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,160
to sit

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:07,839
straight and and sit well yeah

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,399
and um so the the thing that

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,200
really surprised me about making do

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,800
doing these

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,279
workshops and the reason why i kept

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,000
doing them is because

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,399
not only was i able to meet other people

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,560
um

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,480
i was able to have critical discussions

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,800
about the way that technology

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,959
influences us with people from all

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,519
around the world

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,120
and i was also able to force other

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,360
people to make these ridicul

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,360
ridiculous objects with me so

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,640
here is just another picture from the

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,279
meta marathon

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,720
workshop and i just wanted to give this

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,519
presentation to maybe encourage

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,279
other people to uh to do physical

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,800
computing or to do whatever it is that

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,640
you don't feel comfortable with

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,399
but also to encourage you to make with

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,000
other people to make connections with

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,080
other people

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,839
which i think at this time is really

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,839
really important

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,680
and if you want to connect with me you

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,480
can do so by following me on instagram

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,920
or on twitter which you see on the slide

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,240
and i hope that you all figure out

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,000
what your problems with technology are

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,600
and you find your own cardboard

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,120
solutions to them

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,120
