	Ride on Model Railway Signalling using Kubernetes! by Jon Kingsley

Have you ever wondered “what would happen if we used container architecture to avoid crashing ride-on model railways”? Wonder no longer! In this talk, we will cover the basics of running a small ride-on railway in your back yard, using Kubernetes and Raspberry Pis to deploy your signalling, control, and safety infrastructure, and learn how to apply concepts from full-scale railways to your own small-scale endeavours! Watching this talk entitles you to one free ticket to ride the Kubernetes line.

Jonathan is a software engineer at Orbit by day and live production tech, pyrotechnician, and musical theatre peformer by night. His interests include hardware reverse engineering and information security. He has once set a swimming pool on fire.
