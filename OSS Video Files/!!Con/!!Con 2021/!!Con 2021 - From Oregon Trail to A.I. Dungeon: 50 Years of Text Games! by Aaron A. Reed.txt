Description: 
	From Oregon Trail to A.I. Dungeon: 50 Years of Text Games! by Aaron Reed

2021 marks the 50th anniversary of the original text-only Oregon Trail, which debuted in a Minnesota classroom in December 1971. Since then games made with words have been everything from the industry-leading bestsellers to underground avant-garde. In 2021, I began a weekly blog series choosing one text game from each of the past 50 years to analyze in depth, a grand tour through a surprisingly broad range of games: from text adventures to BBS door games to hacking simulators to MUDs to audio games to browser-based idle games and more. In this talk Iâ€™ll share some favorite anecdotes my research has uncovered, fascinating glimpses at people from all kinds of backgrounds across half a century of computing history, pouring their hearts and souls into making interactive stories built with words.

Aaron is a writer and game designer, and game historian focused on helping gamemakers and players tell stories together. He is a multi-time IndieCade and IGF finalist, and has spoken about digital storytelling at venues as diverse as Google, PAX, GaymerX, and WorldCon.

hi

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,880
i'm aaron areed and i'm in the middle of

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,480
a year-long project about the history of

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,560
games made with words

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,400
this december marks the 50th anniversary

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,880
of the original text only organ trail

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,480
game

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,480
and since there are about 50 weeks in a

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,320
year that gave me the idea to spend each

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,400
one of them blogging about a single text

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,200
game from 1971 to today

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,719
one game for each year now when you hear

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,520
text game you might think of text

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,800
adventures

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,239
but there have been all kinds of micro

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,000
genres over the years that have used

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,040
words instead of graphics to tell their

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,719
stories

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,480
of course at first games were forced to

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,000
rely on text because the earliest

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,039
computers had very limited graphical

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,719
capabilities

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,640
but rather than dying out when graphics

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,160
took over text games have wriggled and

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,000
evolved their way into all kinds of

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,199
corners of the gaming landscape

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,879
and without the spotlight of the

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,000
mainstream so many of these games have

00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,920
been free to experiment

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,520
and innovate each of the games this

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,199
series is looking at is a unique

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,760
snapshot of the time and place it was

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,240
made

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,320
a nexus of technical and cultural and

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,680
economic and personal decisions

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,280
many of these games are in danger of

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,880
being lost or have been overlooked by

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,159
newer generations of gamers

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,040
and i've been thrilled to make the case

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,799
why each one is worth remembering

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,400
now choosing which games to cover has

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,000
also been an interesting challenge

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,840
the conceit of covering just a single

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,520
game from each year has meant i've had

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,119
to skip over many classics

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,640
but it's also made me look more closely

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,320
at understudied time periods

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,400
and led me to discover a lot of hidden

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,240
gems the series hit

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,840
1989 just this week so there's a lot

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,159
more to come but no shortage of

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,759
fascinating stories to tell

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,520
in a 10 minute talk i can't begin to do

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,200
justice so i'm just going to take you on

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,720
a whirlwind tour picking one game from

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,840
each decade that's maybe a little more

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,200
on the obscure side

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,960
to give you a taste of all the great

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,119
stories and this weird little thread of

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,040
gaming history

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,799
so let's start with the 70s and the

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,320
first company to succeed at selling

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,640
games for personal computers

00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,240
adventure international not everyone's

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,920
heard of them today but for a few years

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,600
they were the kings of computer gaming

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,960
racking up millions in sales

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,799
and they paved the way for the software

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,000
giants of the 80s the founders of both

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,920
sierra and broderbund

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,840
got their start working there they even

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,800
invented the first retail packaging for

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,480
computer games

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,080
and yeah they came on cassette tapes

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,280
back then now

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,800
if you have heard of this company you

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,360
may think you know who wrote all their

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,959
games

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,879
after all it was his name on all the

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,560
boxes but if we look at the title

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,440
screens for some of these games we see

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,000
another name

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,680
scott's wife at the time alexis so who

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,680
was alexis adams

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,360
she was an entrepreneur who actually ran

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,040
most of the business side of the company

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,480
and also collaborated with scott on some

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,760
of the games even teaching herself

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,040
enough coding to write at least one of

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,720
them herself

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,640
scott credited much of the unique feel

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,440
of pirate adventure their second game to

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,959
her

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,800
it's one of the earliest text adventures

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,480
where the player's main goal is building

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,599
something not collecting treasure or

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,800
killing monsters

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,280
you're shipwrecked and you need to

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,120
repair your boat there's a pirate but

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,720
instead of trying to kill you or rob you

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,400
like npcs in earlier games

00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,760
he basically just wants to get drunk and

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,519
not have to do any work

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,760
at one point you find him sleeping off a

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,440
bender in a graveyard

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,680
alexis had soul author credit on the

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,760
1979 game voodoo castle

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,680
again though only on the title screen

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,360
and this game which is dedicated to all

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,239
moms has a character named after the

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,480
adams's daughter

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,000
megan this character is one of the first

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,360
women in a computer game with

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,800
dialogue scott and alexis later divorced

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,480
and her part in the legacy of the

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,560
company faded over time

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,319
but she was undoubtedly a huge part of

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,640
the world's first successful computer

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,239
game

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,000
studio then there was the 1980s the

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,280
decade of infocom's legendary

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,720
interactive fiction

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,080
but let's fast forward through all that

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,200
and talk instead about an even more

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,000
obscure genre

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,599
play-by-mail gaming in monster island

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,959
you play a castaway survivor on a

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,720
dangerous continent

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,080
the game ran on a computer but the

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,000
players never touched one

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,440
instead they'd fill out a paper order

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,720
form each week detailing their

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,159
character's next moves

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,000
and send it into the company through the

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,840
mail no software required

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
once a week you'd get back a turn report

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,599
a stack of laser printed pages detailing

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,599
the results of your orders

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,680
in monster island thousands of players

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,439
shared the same persistent virtual world

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,439
an enormous continent three times the

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,599
size of australia with over a quarter of

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,439
a million individual locations

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,040
the game started out simple the rulebook

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,320
was just a tiny pamphlet that listed

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,239
less than 20 orders

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,560
but as you kept exploring the list of

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,079
actions you knew how to do would grow

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,080
reach a trading outpost and you'd learn

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,600
orders for buying and selling goods

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,040
stumble across another player and you'd

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,720
learn orders for how to be friendly or

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,720
hostile you might even learn how to

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,560
request and send in entirely different

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,160
kinds of order cards

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,840
years before wikis players had to

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,040
coordinate through letters and fan zines

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,400
to figure out how the game they were

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,479
playing even worked

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,000
and it was so huge that years after it

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,840
launched major portions

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,560
of it like an elaborate magic system

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,400
still remained largely mysterious

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,000
play-by-mail gaming mostly died out in

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,560
lockstep with the rise of email and the

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,320
web

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,320
but a hardcore monster island fanbase

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,960
continued playing the game for almost 30

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,880
years

00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,479
an incredible run for a game its creator

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,400
had hoped would last for three

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,320
in the early 90s a rather unusual game

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,160
was released called silver wolf

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,520
this obscure text adventure is about a

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,280
group of shape-shifting women

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,479
superheroes protecting an ordinary

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,400
schoolgirl they believe is the

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,240
reincarnation of a god

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,160
it was made by and you're not going to

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,560
believe this a group of shape-shifting

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,400
women

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,600
really into school girls and strange

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,240
divinities

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,240
but let's back up in the early 80s saint

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,720
bride's school opened up on the remote

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,560
irish coast it was a sort of fantasy

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,320
camp where women could take on the roles

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,240
of victorian era schoolgirls under the

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,759
tutelage of a strict headmistress

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,759
there was no electricity and modern

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,479
materials like plastic were forbidden

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,240
but sort of inexplicably in 1985 this

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,919
group that shunned the modern world

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,160
started making and selling computer

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,440
games maybe as a publicity stunt to draw

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,880
attention to the school

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,400
or maybe the school was a publicity

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,600
stunt to draw attention to the games

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,360
it's unclear

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,880
in fact many things about saint brides

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,639
are unclear to this day because the

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,720
women behind it deployed a baffling

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,800
array of different names and personas

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,199
there may have been as many as 14 or as

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,560
few as two distinct women behind them

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,880
and what they were really up to in that

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,400
house in ireland remains a puzzle

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,080
some of them had once been involved with

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,759
a group called lux madriana that

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,800
worshipped a female god

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,479
some of them were really into discipline

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,080
whatever their true beliefs silverwolf

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,800
was one of saint bride's last games

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,319
released

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,560
and it's filled with beautiful writing

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,560
and enigmatic riddles i especially love

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,120
this description of a tree made of ice

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,800
filled with the buzzing of silver bees

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,639
there's some suggestion its author may

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,319
have been trans if so this makes

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,120
silverwolf one of the earliest queer

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,880
games

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,560
the full story of saint brides is a wild

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,479
rabbit hole i haven't even mentioned the

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,319
atlantis cult the forbidden door

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,680
or the connection to the 70s king kong

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,199
film but i love

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,639
how it gives the lie to the notion that

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,680
the only people writing text games in

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,560
the 20th century

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,240
were bland hacker dudes and now we've

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,360
reached the 2000s and this next one

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,280
doesn't have any pictures

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,680
because it was a game by and for the

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,680
blind

00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:02,479
proximity biodisruptor mine and 18 feet

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,479
east door and nine feet

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,560
taken west 30 by 50 feet there is an

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,800
exit from the room behind and to the

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,800
left

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,400
shades of doom is an audio only first

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,240
person shooter

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,160
in a time before accessibility modes

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,680
were common blind or disabled gamers who

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,880
wanted an action game had to build it

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,039
themselves

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,039
shades paints an audio soundscape with

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,720
3d position sound which are loaded

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,400
with useful information to help players

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,919
navigate a maze of levels

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,280
approach an intersection for instance

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,199
and you can hear the sound of wind

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,199
blowing down the side corridor

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,280
your constant companion is ava the

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,440
envirometric vector analyzer

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,039
a sort of screen reader for reality who

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,720
at the stroke of a key can describe the

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,840
dimensions of rooms the distance to

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,280
walls or objects

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,599
and turn on a tracking device that helps

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,599
pinpoint the location of moving monsters

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,280
eva supports nearly 40 single key

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,000
commands using almost every key on the

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,680
keyboard

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,440
and learning to quickly deploy them is

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,960
key to staying alive in a maze filled

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,280
with zombies mutant dogs

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,160
cyborgs and traps like pits and jets of

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,840
gas

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,759
surviving the nine levels of gameplay is

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,479
a huge challenge but one that's equally

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,840
hard for blind and sighted players alike

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,599
shades delivers fast-paced

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,280
tension-filled gameplay with only spoken

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,840
words and positional audio

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,039
more than living up to its famous

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,199
namesake

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,479
and finally the 2010s and actually i'm

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,479
going to cheat a bit and pick a game

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,479
from the start of 2020.

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,399
sense in semiosis is a lovely little

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,680
text game about reminiscences triggered

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,000
by bottles of perfume

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,760
lovingly lingered over as you read each

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,760
description and the memories it triggers

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,680
you get to decide what they mean to you

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,279
what you want them to represent

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,279
it's a small game it takes just a few

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,279
minutes to play but behind the scenes is

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,200
an astonishing attention to detail in

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,800
procedurally generating each delicate

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,320
mood and description

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,680
just before this game came out ai

00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,360
dungeon was getting a lot of attention

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,040
for its promise of infinite stories from

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,040
an artificial storyteller

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,279
sense in semiosis is precisely the

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,360
opposite a carefully sculpted and very

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,200
human marriage of pros and systems

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,480
to produce a handcrafted joyful

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,160
experience

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,519
it's also part of an unbroken thread of

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,360
text game history

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,880
written at the end of the 2010s in an

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,000
interactive story design language made

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,080
in the 2000s

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,080
that evolved from a 90s language reverse

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,000
engineering infocom story format from

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,440
the 80s which originated in turn in the

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,519
70s with zork

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,360
some of zurich's technical dna still

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,800
lives in sense and semiosis today and

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,320
that's pretty cool

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,760
it's up for a nebula award for game

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,959
writing this year alongside much more

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,080
well-known titles but

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,240
i think it's beautiful that this

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,279
delicate handcrafted sculpture made from

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,480
words and code

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,240
is on that stage so in the past half

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,839
century text games have been everything

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,080
from the mainstream to the underground

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,360
and all kinds of weirdnesses in between

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,440
they've been made by all kinds of people

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,120
with all kinds of things to say explored

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,480
countless ways that texts can be fluid

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,600
and stories reactive

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,040
and been a constant source of

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,920
inspiration as small creators with

00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,760
unique visions

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,120
have redefined what games made of words

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,240
can do mean

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,279
and be over and over again

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,880
if you want to follow along with the

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,200
rest of the series you can find it at
