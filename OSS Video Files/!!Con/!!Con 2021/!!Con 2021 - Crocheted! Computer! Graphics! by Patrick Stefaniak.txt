Description: 
	Crocheted! Computer! Graphics! by Patrick Stefaniak

Making 3D graphics and creating textile art are surprisingly similar! In this talk I will show the work from my MFA thesis exhibition, CLOTH^3, which includes a videogame, a giant crocheted cube, and a series of 3D prints to explore the connections between these two disciplines. These threads are both historical, hearkening back to early computers like the Jacquard loom and circuits made by hand, and material, in the rendering of shapes from scattered points into lines - faces - volumes. By taking a craft approach to videogame design we can queer the gender configurations of labor like crocheting or programming and create new ways of working and playing.

Patrick Stefaniak is currently an MFA student in Digital Art + New Media at UC Santa Cruz, earned a BFA in Digital Art from Indiana University in 2015, and has worked in New York as a Creative Technologist. He works with 3D games, virtual reality, video performance, installation, writing, hole punching, crocheting, and 3D printing to think about rendering, perception, labor, queerness, and fun.

hi

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,400
my name is patrick stefaniak and i'm

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,480
currently an mfa student in digital arts

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,720
and new media at uc santa cruz

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,840
and my talk today is crochet computer

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,160
graphics

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,920
i'll talk about my mfa thesis cloth

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,760
cubed and why i think it's interesting

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,079
and useful to think about textiles and

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,000
computer graphics together

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,600
i started crocheting after reading about

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,600
the crochet coral reef

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,440
which is a communal project started by

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,520
the institute for figuring

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,600
they ran workshops teaching participants

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,000
how to crochet using a simple method of

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,039
adding

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,120
a stitch in a regular interval to create

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,199
forms that are geometrically accurate

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,399
models of hyperbolic geometry

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,960
that also resembled coral what i found

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,120
useful

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,120
about this was a method for rendering

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,239
forms that was both mathematical and

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,800
biological

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,640
they used a single simple technique that

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,560
through small variations can produce

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,400
wildly different shapes

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,600
it also removes a sense of correctly

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,680
creating a form

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,520
as an irregular stitch can become a seed

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,439
for an interesting variation rather than

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,200
just being a mistake

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,560
i was also interested in a paper written

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,119
by jean vacaro

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,479
feelings and fractals woolly ecologies

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,080
of transgender matter

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,240
where she does a reading of this project

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,880
along ideas of trans

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,320
aesthetics and practices which proposes

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,000
craft as a way of thinking about the

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,600
daily practice of maintaining and

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,840
constructing our bodies and identities

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,720
another paper by victoria mitchell

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,119
titled draw

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,040
drawing threads from site to site

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,720
discusses how textile production is

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,240
integral to how we construct and

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,240
perceive space

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,920
a piece of cloth starts out as loose

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,600
fibers which are then spun

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,880
or drawn into a line of yarn

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,240
which is then woven into a cloth reading

00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,680
this i immediately connected that

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,479
sequence to the process

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,040
of constructing a 3d model a set of

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,759
points

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,960
in a space are connected by edges which

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,800
join into faces

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,800
which close up into 3d shapes

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,239
in doing more research i learned that

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,640
the history of computing is also

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,160
entwined with textile production

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,480
one of the earliest working computers

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,160
was the jackard loom a weaving machine

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,200
which uses a series of wooden punch

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,400
cards to determine

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,560
thread patterns also early computing

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,280
used to involve a lot of hand wiring of

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,519
circuits

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,280
and was considered a feminine task it

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,120
wasn't until programming became a less

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,160
physically oriented task that it began

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,680
to have the masculine

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,280
associations it still carries today

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,120
cloth cube interacts with all these

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,160
ideas by focusing on different methods

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,640
of rendering a cue

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,560
made of cloth either by crocheting or by

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,000
using cloth simulation tools and blender

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,200
and unity

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,840
there are three pieces in the show

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,920
unity primitive cube a two scale

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,519
crocheted rendering of the standard cube

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,920
in the unity game engine

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,040
which measures one meter cubed that can

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,480
be picked up and held by the visitors

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,560
a few ways of being a cube a grid of 64

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,599
3d prints of cubes that have been

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,360
deformed through cloth simulation

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,159
and it's meant to be looked at and not

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,280
touched and

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,519
cubism 2 baroque edition a video game

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,959
which has digital versions of both of

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,200
the other two sculptures that can be

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,720
played with in a variety of ways

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,720
as an installation it's played on a

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,760
touch screen and also projected onto the

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,519
wall

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:47,840
but there's also a desktop version that

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:47,840
is downloadable on hgo

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,210
[Music]

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:07,680
[Laughter]

00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:09,040
[Music]

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:30,410
[Laughter]

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:33,990
[Music]

00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,990
[Laughter]

00:04:42,180 --> 00:05:05,680
[Music]

00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:14,720
[Laughter]

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:18,800
[Music]

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:31,759
[Laughter]

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:33,840
[Music]

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,919
in order to access these ties between

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,759
textiles and digital graphics i focused

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,919
my work on using the class simulation

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,919
tools in blender and unity

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,280
this is an ongoing interesting problem

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,960
in computer graphics

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,520
where the goal is to create realistic

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,280
cloth movement the basic method is by

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,000
considering the 3d geometry

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,199
as a mesh of nodes which stretch and

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,880
then compress

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,800
in relation to one another based on a

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,720
complex set of rules

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,479
the project focuses on tools that are

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,080
easy and available to use because i'm

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,199
more interested in working on them with

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,720
my hands

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,000
through the interface rather than trying

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,680
to build my own mathematical models

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,280
each of these pieces in the show renders

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,600
the same cube in different scales

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,960
techniques materials and modes of

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,720
interactivity

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,080
digital graphics are hard to understand

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,840
because the way that they're created is

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,479
obfuscated by the machine

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,759
and high resolution of the screen when

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,840
you look at the crocheted

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,600
or 3d printed cubes you can see the

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,240
stitches and the lines of filament that

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,600
are accumulated to build up the shape

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,520
you can picture what the labor looked

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,560
like and know that you could learn how

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,479
to create similar objects

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,680
by repeating uh these cubes in these

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,600
three formats

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,680
which are digital and physical and very

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,639
specific ways i hope that the viewer can

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,039
gain a material

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,720
hands-on grasp of both the technology

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,440
and the theoretical and art historical

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,680
references

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,080
which mainly come from the minimal and

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,400
baroque art

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,080
baroque art like the music of bach or

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,840
the sculpture of bernini

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,199
was characterized by virtuosic

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,479
performances

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,240
of specific sets of rules as you can see

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,720
cloth simulation has been an interesting

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,560
and difficult problem for a long time

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,080
today we have computers which are great

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,880
at following rules

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,000
my ability to play piano or sculpt

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,120
delicately are

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,560
far exceeded by what code can do my hand

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,319
is still present and playing with these

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,680
tools and selecting outcomes that are

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,280
interesting to me

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,680
none of this has been fully decided by

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,360
an algorithm i can relieve myself of the

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,960
pressure to perform correctly and allow

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,800
myself to create in ways that i find

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,720
joyful

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,880
minimal art is characterized by simple

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,880
shapes which typically attempt to avoid

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,880
representational references

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,360
and by serial modes of production which

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,240
are often outsourced to be manufactured

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,160
by people other than the artist

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,840
and these ways it's remarkably similar

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,199
to digital art

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,960
where the computer does the work of

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,759
rendering and favors multiples

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,039
variations

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,120
and basic geometry i especially find

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,039
useful how minimalism draws attention to

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,000
the viewer's bodily relationship to the

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,520
object

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,199
which interaction design tries to

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,840
eliminate in the name of a seamless

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,280
user experience fabricating a giant

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,960
steel sculpture is expensive and

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,120
difficult but with projections

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,319
and vr headsets we can quickly recreate

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,599
similar forms

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,070
that can be displayed in a larger

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,879
variety of contexts

00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,479
[Music]

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,000
my video game making practice has been

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,919
greatly influenced by

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,720
ideas from queer video game design

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,479
especially the ethos describes in

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,840
rise of the video game scenesters by

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,399
anna anthopy

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,919
about approaching games as zines in

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,680
terms of their diy production and

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,440
distribution

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,279
this allowed me to think about other

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,120
forms video games can be modeled after

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,479
like a painting sculpture or video

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,640
installation

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,680
which each has their own standards of

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,990
being made

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,680
shown and sold

00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,600
[Music]

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,680
thinking about game design as a textile

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,000
craft similarly allows us to shift the

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,080
frame

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,480
of how we approach using these tools and

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,440
what is considered a legitimate work

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,360
unity primitive cube was made using one

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,640
basic stitch that was repeated thousands

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,959
of times

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,279
cubism 2 baroque edition is built as an

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,120
accumulation of short vignettes

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,959
each with a different way of interacting

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,560
with the cubes on the screen

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,720
because the scenes are separate from one

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,000
another i'm free to reuse or reconfigure

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,120
code and assets

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,519
in ways that would be seen as

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,600
inefficient and standard game design

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,200
this relieves many roadblocks that are

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,480
encountered in programming and game

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,160
design where a large

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,680
seamless game has to have many parts

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,600
that work in unison

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,920
instead i get to focus on one action at

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,200
a time when that piece is done

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,360
i don't have to keep going back and

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,760
fixing or updating it and so the

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,440
question

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,640
becomes how to sew the pieces together

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,640
once they're all finished

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,560
i believe that anyone can learn how to

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,519
use complicated software like unity or

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,120
blender

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,040
the problem isn't how to feel

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,240
comfortable getting started

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,000
just like teaching someone how to

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,360
crochet i think it's a matter of sitting

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,920
with people and showing them how to do

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,399
that first

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,240
basic stitch like adding vertices to the

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,760
initial blender cube or placing objects

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,399
in unity to look at them with the first

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,600
person controller with that one

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,959
fundamental action

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,959
