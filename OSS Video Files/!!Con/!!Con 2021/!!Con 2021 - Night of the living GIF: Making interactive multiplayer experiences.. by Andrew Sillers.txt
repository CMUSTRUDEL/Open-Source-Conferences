	Night of the living GIF: Making interactive multiplayer experiences on a static webpage! (pronounce “GIF” however you like :) by Andrew Sillers

The Web is full of opportunities to upload static HTML: blog comments, user profiles, and even emails can all host user-supplied text and images. But haven’t you ever wished you could replace all your sleepy static content with real-time interactive multiplayer games? By harnessing the magic of HTTP and (mis)using the awesome power of GIFs, we’ll do just that, with no JavaScript required!

Andrew is a programmer who thinks a lot about security. He enjoys copyright law, federated services, and surprising solutions.
