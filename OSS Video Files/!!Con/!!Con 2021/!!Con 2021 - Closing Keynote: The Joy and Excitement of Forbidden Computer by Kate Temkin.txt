	Closing Keynote: The Joy and Excitement of Forbidden Computer by Kate Temkin

Kate Temkin is a hardware hacker and low-level engineer who spends most of her time exploring the hardware/software boundary and figuring out how to empower people with educational technology. Her recent interests include building hardware, software, and gateware for USB development, reverse engineering, and hacking.

When not hacking hardware, she maintains a variety of open-source projects, including LUNA, ViewSB, FaceDancer, and GreatFET, and probably spends more time than she should reverse engineering and be creating educational materials.
