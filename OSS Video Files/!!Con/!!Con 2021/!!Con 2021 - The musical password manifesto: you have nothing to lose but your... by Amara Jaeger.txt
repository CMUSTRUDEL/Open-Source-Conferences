	The musical password manifesto: you have nothing to lose but your FRcK7y23ckdqwCYPq! by Amara Jaeger

You’ve probably typed at least one plain text password today, but have you stopped to question why it had to be this way?? Who decided we should hide our most intimate data behind a secret phrase of characters– the more random and meaningless the better?? Seems pretty arbitrary, and really not that fun. Want to know what’s equally arbitrary and way more fun?? Musical passwords!!! In this talk, I’ll extol the virtues and mostly the fun of musical passwords, and explain a simple scheme for encoding them. By the end of this talk, you’ll hopefully have an understanding of how to easily map password data to some fun variables. This will leave you with no good excuse not to implement fun authentication in your future password-protected projects!
