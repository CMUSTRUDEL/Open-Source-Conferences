	Cursorless: keyboards and mice are sooo last year!! by Pokey Rule

“swap funky fine whale”. As a human being, which I assume you are, my dear reader (sorry bots!), this phrase probably doesn’t mean a whole lot to you. But my computer snaps to action, swapping a particular pair of functions. I am going to talk about Cursorless, a voice coding tool I developed on top of Talon and VSCode that helped me turn accessibility into a super power.

When editing code with a keyboard and mouse, your world centers around a little cursor. So, naturally, initial work on code editing by voice also centered around the same little cursor. But why should we be restricted by what works well with a keyboard? When two landscape designers discuss a design, they’re not stuck with a laser pointer and a hundred small buttons, they say “move the red vase to the top corner”. Let’s bring the same fluency to coding. And hey, maybe I’ll make a keyboard version of the tool to make coding a bit more accessible for people stuck with a keyboard and mouse 😉.

Pokey is a freelance software engineer who will happily spend 3 weeks optimizing his coding setup to shave 10 seconds off a 5-minute task. He enjoys running, wild swimming and crocheting various and sundry small animals while coding by voice. Find him on Twitter at @PokeyRule and in the Talon slack workspace at @pokey.

wrap our god with funk flatten

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,439
extract that as hello world

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,439
nope 3 now drows hi

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,960
my name is pokey rule and today i'm

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,079
going to be talking about what just

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,320
happened

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,480
um so let me start off by running that

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,840
back by keyboard

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,680
hopefully that'll be clear what i was

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,320
doing so

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,680
i wanted to wrap this function call

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,520
argument with

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,719
the function call flatten so i

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,239
was a heavy vim user by keyboard so i

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,440
think i do it relatively quickly by

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,920
keyboard so flattened

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,559
okay i wrapped it in a function call and

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,199
then

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,239
um i wanted to then go and extract that

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:08,560
function call as a new variable

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:12,720
so let's grab that call it hello world

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:16,240
const hello world equals and then

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,400
i paste that um okay so let me try on

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,080
that again by voice

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,159
so let me put the cursor back where it

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,840
was before um

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,119
but it doesn't really matter because as

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,119
you'll see i don't actually use the

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,799
cursor

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:34,240
wrap our odd with funk flatten

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,240
extract that as hello world

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:40,479
drows so that's cursorless

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,240
a tool that i developed on top of talon

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,920
and visual studio code

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,680
but that's not where the story begins uh

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,600
the story begins

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,840
in 2011 when i was diagnosed with

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,040
repetitive strain injury from coding too

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,159
much

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,840
from when i was a little kid it's what i

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,240
absolutely love to do and

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,360
it was really devastating to to be

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,040
diagnosed with that and

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,479
to think that i potentially wouldn't be

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,520
able to code

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,280
again um and it was a long journey from

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,280
there i got better i got worse i got

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,319
better i got worse

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,599
and until the beginning of this year i

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,040
discovered this amazing piece of

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,160
software called talon which

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,920
is a voice coding framework that allows

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,080
you to basically define

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,000
any commands and a grammar

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,120
to do things to completely control your

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,959
computer

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:35,519
even coding one of the challenges with

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,120
talon is navigating around a file

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,800
a lot of people use eye trackers but for

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,319
me it's not really an option because i

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,400
like to move around a lot

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,000
i like to stand i sit i take my pick up

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,360
my laptop i go somewhere else

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and eye trackers don't work in those

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,440
sort of scenarios so i built

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,920
this tool to quickly jump around the

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,760
file

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,040
so i can give you a quick demo of that

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,440
um

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,800
so you see the all these little hats on

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,480
all of the tokens so

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,080
it picks one letter from each of the

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,400
tokens and it decorates it

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,920
um either with a hat with no color or a

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,200
hat with the color if there's no color

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,480
you don't have to say the color so i'll

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,640
show you an example of that

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,080
let's say i wanted to jump here i would

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,360
basically say the name

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,879
for e now i don't use e i use

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,480
a word each and so each every different

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,560
letter has a different word so w

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:28,720
is whale o is odd etc so

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:32,159
i can say take each

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,519
drows so drows just puts it to sleep uh

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,120
tells talent to stop listening and that

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,720
click sound tells it to start listening

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,400
so it makes it easy for me to quickly go

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,599
back and forth between talking to you

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,440
and talking to talon um so you can see

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,959
i can say the color so let's say this

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:50,000
one i would say blue

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,000
fine right so take blue find drows

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,599
okay so that's how it started a quick

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,360
way to jump around the file

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,720
but then i had this realization which

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,840
was

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,360
if i can easily talk about any place

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,280
within a file

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,799
why do i even need to move my cursor

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,480
there at all um

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,080
why don't i just say what i want to have

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,200
happen so

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,000
for example let's say i wanted to

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,479
delete this i can just say chuck whale

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,919
drows

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,440
when you see it just gets deleted my

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,639
cursor never moved it still has foo

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,160
selected

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,400
so i can do all sorts of things i can

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,400
say

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,160
square wrap look drows

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,080
so that puts squares around this thing

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,680
right a bunch of these actions um

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,560
delete um copy um wrapping all sorts of

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,080
different things

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,919
um uh so that was the first

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,199
step sorry that was the second step

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,160
rather um

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,199
then the third was okay talking about

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,520
single tokens

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,560
is fairly useful but it's not that

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,400
useful because

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,479
oftentimes you want to operate on bigger

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,840
things than just tokens um

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,600
so for example uh this

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,199
entire function call right if i wanted

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,680
to grab that um

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,880
i have a transformation so um which

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,639
basically takes

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,080
whatever it is that i'm talking about

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,000
and i can say

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,600
pick the the function call containing it

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,280
so for example

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,960
take call air drows

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,000
so notice that that took that entire

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,199
function call right and there's all

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,800
sorts of things i can do so

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,160
uh all sorts of different

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,600
transformations that are defined so if i

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,600
wanted to delete this whole if statement

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,440
i could just say

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:34,080
chuck if air browse

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,680
so that deleted that um so that was the

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,400
next step right so now i can do things

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,560
where i can cut

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,840
copy whole sections right i could just

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,680
take that function and

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:47,120
and grab it and then

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,759
then the next step from there was well

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,800
okay so i have these hats i kind of go

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,360
full circle and

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,800
back to the cursor you know it's called

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,479
cursorless but the cursor there is

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,919
something useful about having a cursor

00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,880
so you don't need the cursor when you

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,960
don't want it

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,800
but it can be useful to have the cursor

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,319
so for example if i'm in an area

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,360
let's say take trap

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,600
drops okay my cursor is here right

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,199
so now i can use transformations so for

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,639
example if i wanted to take this whole

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,479
list i could just say

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,319
take list drows so you can see

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,759
instead of saying one of the hats i

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,039
actually just don't say anything and it

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,400
assumes i want the cursor

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,560
and one of the cool things about this is

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,680
it works with multiple cursors

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,520
so for example um let's say we have we

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,639
have this list again

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:38,639
i'm going to grab a few of these take

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,639
whale and fine and gust

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,919
drowse okay now i have a few cursors and

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,120
i can

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:50,160
and then now i can say

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,160
square wrap art nope

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,280
square wrap element drows

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,960
so you can see it looked at where the

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,080
cursor was and then it applied the

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,840
transformation

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,199
and the action to each of these

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,400
different cursors

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:09,199
um so uh that's

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,440
um sort of the the core of what a

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,440
cursorless can do it's uh it has these

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,960
marks which are these hats or cursors it

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,880
has transformations

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,160
which can modify each of these different

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,039
things

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,039
and its

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,319
actions which can alter whatever the

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,680
target is

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,360
so let me give you a quick example of

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,720
this in action

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:35,840
so let's say i wanted to take this list

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,840
and turn it into a simple dictionary so

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:45,840
take every element copy that push

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,840
cool gap paste that

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:53,199
clear lack lace

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,199
clear rack race

00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:01,680
chuck blue race disk so you can see

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,720
i've now transformed that list um into a

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,160
dictionary

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,800
um drows i gotta remember to put it to

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,400
sleep

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,440
um so uh that's cursorless at a high

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,319
level um

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,680
uh there's i'm still actively developing

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,319
features um

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,800
i made a bunch of new ones in the past

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,840
week

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,280
thanks to uh the motivation that uh

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,680
a conference deadline was able to give

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,199
me um and uh but i'm still developing

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,039
more it's been an absolute blast i've

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,759
had so much fun building this thing

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,280
building all the different

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,880
transformations and then watching it all

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,440
come together and then as i'm building

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,440
it

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,479
i can build it faster as i build more

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,880
features so

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,760
um i guess if i were gonna close with a

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,120
lesson

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,640
or a message uh it would be uh

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,959
don't let anyone tell you that your

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,040
challenges are disabilities um

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:52,000
when i was diagnosed with repetitive

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,040
strain injury i thought i couldn't code

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,080
and i no longer had that ability um and

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,519
uh but now without that i never would

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,480
have found voice coding and

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,160
uh i am now coding by voice oftentimes

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,800
faster than i ever coded with a keyboard

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,120
and i have

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,720
so much fun doing it um i feel like a

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,399
wizard casting spouse which is just

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,760
amazing so

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,959
thank you so much for listening i hope

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,959
