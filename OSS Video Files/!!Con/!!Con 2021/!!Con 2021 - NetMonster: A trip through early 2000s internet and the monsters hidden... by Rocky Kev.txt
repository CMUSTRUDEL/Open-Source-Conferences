	NetMonster: A trip through early 2000s internet and the monsters hidden inside websites! by Rocky Kev

In the year 2000, before Google was a verb and websites were build with tables, there existed a game called NetMonsters. Players would visit websites and find monsters to add to their collection. The more techno-savvy players, who were building sites on Geocities, Tripod, and Angelfire, werenâ€™t just creating a home for their thoughts - they created a world for their monsters.

Nearly all of those sites are gone now. In this talk, I cover the mechanics of NetMonsters and journey through the wayback machine, through Geocities archives, and through data hoarder torrents to reveal the lost NetMonster communities.

Rocky is a web developer, game developer, organizer, and teacher. He is an introvert and enjoys eating waffles and rock climbing - both are solo sports. He likes to be in the forefront of web technology and is endlessly fascinated by the ever-changing web landscape.
