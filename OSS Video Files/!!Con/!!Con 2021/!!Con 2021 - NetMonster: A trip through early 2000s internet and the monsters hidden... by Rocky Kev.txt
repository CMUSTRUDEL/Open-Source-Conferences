	NetMonster: A trip through early 2000s internet and the monsters hidden inside websites! by Rocky Kev

In the year 2000, before Google was a verb and websites were build with tables, there existed a game called NetMonsters. Players would visit websites and find monsters to add to their collection. The more techno-savvy players, who were building sites on Geocities, Tripod, and Angelfire, werenâ€™t just creating a home for their thoughts - they created a world for their monsters.

Nearly all of those sites are gone now. In this talk, I cover the mechanics of NetMonsters and journey through the wayback machine, through Geocities archives, and through data hoarder torrents to reveal the lost NetMonster communities.

Rocky is a web developer, game developer, organizer, and teacher. He is an introvert and enjoys eating waffles and rock climbing - both are solo sports. He likes to be in the forefront of web technology and is endlessly fascinated by the ever-changing web landscape.

hi

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,080
i'm rocky in this talk we'll be covering

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,840
netmonster a game that no longer exists

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,760
i'll show you some netmonster fan sites

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,760
from the early 2000s internet

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,840
and as a heads up this will be a very

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,119
visual talk i've embedded websites

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,199
directly into these slides

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,240
and i won't necessarily read the content

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,840
out loud but

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,840
hopefully you can read all the funny

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,719
bits yourself and can always get the

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,920
slides later

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,719
so let's jump right into it

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,920
hi i'm rocky in this talk we'll be

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,480
covering netmonster

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,559
a game that no longer exists i'll show

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,320
you some net monster fan sites from the

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,600
early 2000s internet

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,760
and this talk is a very visual talk

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,640
i've embedded websites directly into

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,879
these slides

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,079
and i won't necessarily read the content

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,480
out loud but

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,920
hopefully this video is very detailed

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,840
and you kind of read all the funny bits

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,799
on your own or at least get the slides

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,119
later so

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,119
let's jump right into it and

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,080
now this is classic

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,880
pre-web 2.0 internet so for anyone out

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,119
of the loop

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,600
this is a professionally built site for

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,640
the cult classic film space jam

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,159
this site is real it still exists it has

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,600
valid web code and

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,759
again very classic internet

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,640
it has excellent design taste it has

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,280
animation

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,720
it has blue text on green background not

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,799
to mention a table layout

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,240
and we have a banner up here and i want

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,439
to emphasize this

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,680
was done by professionals

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,600
now the sites that were built by novices

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,680
weren't exactly different

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,920
this is also a real website found in the

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,399
wayback machine roughly the year 2000

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,479
and

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,520
still table layout some interesting

00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,680
color choices

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,560
there's banners and badges there's a

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,240
guest book

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,159
and there's a web counter which the

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,280
service is down so i've made it green so

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,439
you can see it

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,759
what you don't hear is a two minute

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,560
chrono trigger audio midi file

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,560
looping in the background there's even a

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,480
under construction text because back

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,720
then you need to be on the internet now

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,319
there was no staging type sites for us

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,200
and this is a fan site

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,959
dedicated to the game netmonster we'll

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,840
come back to this site and but i just

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,000
want to give you

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,080
the glimpse of early 2000s internet

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
because this can be a culture shock

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,680
if you're not familiar with yellow text

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,959
on noisy backgrounds and

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,120
so let's just kind of get that out of

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,160
our system

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,920
and let's talk about net monster this

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,239
game existed from roughly 1999 to

00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,319
2001-ish

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,680
and the thing i want to point out is

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,080
this guy here

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,000
this is a net monster badge because

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,840
hidden on this webpage is a collectible

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,319
monster

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,080
the monsters came in all sorts of weird

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,480
shapes and sizes the

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,200
tagline for the game was internet

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,599
monster hunting at its finest

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,680
now netmonster was a free downloadable

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,360
game from the late 90s where you collect

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,720
monsters from urls

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,760
uh for net monster it was a very

00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,200
pokemon-esqueness with the collecting

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,519
and how it worked was

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,400
the player would grab a url with a nut

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,080
monster badge

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,920
the player would enter into the game

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,599
based on the code snippet the game

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,000
client would generate a monster so

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,920
one url equals one monster and you

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,640
needed strong monsters to defeat the bad

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,280
guys

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,000
the game stopped at version 1.4 because

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,720
a hard drive

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,519
crash erased the source code and there

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,000
was never a net monster version 2.

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,159
and here's a crazy fact this game has

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,560
been abandoned for more than 15 years

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,560
and

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,280
you can still run the netmaster client

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,640
today it was written.net and works on

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,000
windows 10 machines

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:55,920
it's an absolute tech marvel

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,720
so today we visit the same websites like

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,080
facebook and reddit and wikipedia and in

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,519
the early 2000s

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,560
when we called it the information

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,959
superhighway there was no wikipedia

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,319
but there was a lot of people who had to

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,040
share their knowledge

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,680
so they built websites and often for

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,480
free

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,720
so there was an industry of free website

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,959
builders like geocities or a tripod or a

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,280
dozen other free web services

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,240
and to find these knowledge sites was

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,639
still a challenge

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,520
google was still being figured out in

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,240
2000 like

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,560
searching did exist but i mean good luck

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,560
and

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,120
much of the internet was organizing

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,360
topics in what we called web rings

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,040
people made websites based on a specific

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:42,479
topic and they joined a web ring

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,080
and really very often we just created

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,560
shrines for our internet

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,360
anime waifus and you put your website on

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,320
the web ring and

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,680
now people can find it and going back to

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,840
net monsters

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,600
there were net monster websites because

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,520
to catch net monsters you need

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,280
to find websites with the net monster

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,639
badge which means visiting net monster

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,520
web rings which means being familiar

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,639
with fansites

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,800
about netmonster

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,199
and this is where we hit this sad point

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,240
because that is a lie that internet

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,199
isn't forever

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,800
this was an obscure game in 2000 these

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,960
fan sites are dead

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,320
you can't google net monsters and find

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,400
anything about the game

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,440
i went to page 50 in the search results

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,520
it's not there

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,639
these fan sites are gone from the modern

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,759
web heck

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,479
geocities doesn't even exist anymore so

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,000
i dug into the backups of data hoarders

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,840
through geocd torrents

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,280
and through the wayback machine in order

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,039
to find these fan sites

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,880
that no longer exist in the modern

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,600
internet which brings me back to

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,199
kragock's

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,199
net monster reality fan site

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,400
so kragock what is your site about

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,400
i've included the metadata because i

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,320
just thought it was hilarious

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,840
so on the left side it's hard to see

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,759
there's an faq

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,160
uh kragel provides links to catch

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,720
monsters but if we scroll down

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,639
i love this fan art and you can kind of

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,600
guesstimate kragock's age

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,039
and this text is hilarious and over here

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,240
is that net monster

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,240
web ring list

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,120
the links to catch net monsters they're

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,560
not all pages full of content many of

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,199
these fan sites had

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,800
pages upon pages of empty html files

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,360
with a single button

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,800
and sometimes a banner like this was an

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,840
actual web page

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,960
so let's move on like so this is

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,120
comics castle his banner out tax is

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,800
kind of interesting but if we scroll

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,880
down he has a bunch of really sweet

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,120
material for that net monster visitor

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,960
there's even comics which unfortunately

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,720
leads to broken images

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,720
i want to show this random story off

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,000
april 1st 2001

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,400
where he says net monster sucks

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,240
why do i even have this page up anymore

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,400
i'm erasing this page tomorrow

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,680
and i just uploaded a virus to your

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,080
computer for even

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,120
daring to play netmonster then you read

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,120
the next line

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,199
april fool are you joker

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,880
let's keep trucking along this is

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,720
darcy's net monsters

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,960
let's ignore the h1 for a bit and scroll

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,160
to the goods and it's it's really cute

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,800
this line dogs wolf take us home

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,240
oh darcy darcy was a helpful member of

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,319
the net monster community

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,680
darcy even organized the monsters into

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,280
these categories for us

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,440
thanks darcy but heading back to that h1

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,919

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,800

or refer a bunch of people to buy it so

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,160
darcy is saying over here

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:44,080
refer me get me a premium license

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:46,800
and i will give you secrets darcy was an

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,800
entrepreneur

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,319
so we had some fun sites but here's some

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,680
of the sadness not

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,520
every site was intact like powerpuff ca

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,160
look at the right side and all those

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,599
four or four

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:03,039
errors pointing to images what was here

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:05,280
we would never know then we have dux's

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,960
site ducks had a net monster choose your

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,680
own adventure

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,560
and he had a quiz and none of this none

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,840
of the links worked

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,840
and i looked

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,680
so that was kind of sad so let's kind of

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,879
get real depressing and wrap up

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,479
with uh chris's net monsters so around

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,400
the early 2000s

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,440
chris hosted his net monster site on a

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,120
free hosting platform called vr9

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,280
and somewhere between fall and winter of

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,599
2000 chris revamped his site

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,440
to be more of a table design you could

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,719
really start to see his hobby peek

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,519
on this page where he has over 2400 net

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,240
monsters

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:46,000
in his collection and i just love on the

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,000
sideways shows off his computer specs

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,440
but something fascinating happened in

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,080
the year 2000 which was

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,640
the dot-com bubble burst and that free

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,080
host

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:59,760
was affected and what i know

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,959
is that by 2005 that url pointed

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,680
to this site on the right now this isn't

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,200
an end to chris's story because maybe

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,680
chris knew about living on

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,560
free web hosts because chris migrated as

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,519
much as he could

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,959
to a new free hosting server and while

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,920
the design is still there he

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,120
even calls his account netmonster but

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,760
something is missing

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,040
which is a lot of the details because

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,200
but in 2003

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,959
just one year after the migration

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,720
something else major happened

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,839
this time it wasn't involving any

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,519
dot-com bursts or bubbles

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,279
in 2003 chris changed he revamped his

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,959
website the url is still the same it

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,360
still has a net monster url

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,959
but now it's a blog about latin and

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,279
there's no reference to that monster

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,360
it's

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,800
it's sad like real toy story 3 sad

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,959
there's a lot of sites i didn't even

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,000
cover but we can start to piece together

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,160
this universe and

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,920
it's kind of pointy at all of these

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,920
missing pieces

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,320
and here's the thing i don't even like

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,320
net monster it was an awful game

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,480
and that's what makes me sad because i

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,399
had a random thought about a random web

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,920
game that i played for like two days in

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,760
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,920
and you can't deny that there's a real

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,160
history that the modern internet

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,440
has nothing about the internet is

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,519
incredibly fragile and

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:22,000
if it wasn't for the wayback machine it

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,000
