	Numeric Data Types in the Wild; or: Let’s Look at Last Night’s Dinner Receipt! by Michael Woods

You won’t believe the wild things we’ll find by taking a good look at a dinner receipt.

Come and spend ten minutes having a laugh at some of the pitfalls and travails embedded in a simple POS (point of sale) device printout. And remember: this was the real output of a launched-and-shipped software program that was written by living, thinking, and breathing human beings. How could it have gone so wrong?

Michael is a physicist-turned-inventor out in California. He works by day as a Principal Systems Architect at Magic Leap, and spends his evenings studying everything under the sun. His perfect vacation is spending a couple weeks in a new city, ensconced in cafes, speed-running an online class. And he believes that self-improvement, in every form, is simultaneously an art, a skill, and a lot of fun.
