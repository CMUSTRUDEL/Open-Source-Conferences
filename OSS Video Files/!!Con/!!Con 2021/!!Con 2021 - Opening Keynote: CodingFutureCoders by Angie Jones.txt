hi

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,960
i'm angie jones i'm the senior director

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,160
of developer relations at applitues

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:26,480
today i want to talk about coding future

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,279
coders there's very few things that i

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,960
enjoy

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:34,399
more than coding looking at a problem

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,360
opening a blank canvas creating a

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,640
solution

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:42,719
to that problem and then seeing it

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,760
execute the joy

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,160
how many fields are there where a large

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,480
percentage of the professionals

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:55,440
also do their jobs as a hobby

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,879
many of us we work on side projects we

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,359
work nights we work

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:05,040
weekends we work holidays just for fun

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:08,799
it's almost unconceivable that

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:13,040
people actually pay us to do this stuff

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:16,240
remember when you first started

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,040
i'm sure a lot of you fondly recall the

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,560
days of the commodore 64

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,880
and typing your very first hello

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,720
only to discover that you needed to

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,159
learn a new language

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,680
to tinker with this thing you learned

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:36,799
some basic commands and were able to do

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,000
a bit of math with it

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,000
and if you were really hardcore you had

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,520
a subscription to one of the magazines

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,240
such as compute

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,799
which provided typing code for you to

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,799
try out

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,079
while i grew up in the 80s these are not

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,479
my memories

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,680
i wasn't exposed to these things as a

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,040
child

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,600
i didn't have a commodore 64.

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,960
i've never touched an issue of compute

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,000
magazine

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,920
in fact this was not something

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,800
i'd ever heard of i didn't find my joy

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,480
of coding

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,280
until i went off to college i entered my

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,599
freshman year very uncertain about what

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,800
i wanted to do for a living

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,640
i chose business as my major because it

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,360
seemed like a broad enough

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,000
discipline to be applicable to whatever

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,840
it is

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,680
i did end up becoming my father

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,800
he was an accountant and he'd seen signs

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,920
of technology becoming this emerging

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,040
space

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,680
so he encouraged me to take a computer

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,519
course just so that i knew how to use

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,040
these things

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:56,400
well silly me i enrolled

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,840
in a c plus plus programming course

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,480
i know i didn't know what programming

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,599
was i

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,879
never heard the phrase c plus but

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:10,319
college is all about exploration right

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,800
so at the age of 18 i wrote my very

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,319
first

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:18,000
hello world i instantly

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,879
became hooked the thrill of crafting

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
the commands to you know magically make

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,480
the computer

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,760
do as i imagined ah the power

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,560
right and after each class we'd get

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,120
a homework assignment and i remember

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,239
racing to the computer lab to complete

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,360
mine

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:43,040
i'd save it to a floppy disk

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,760
and i probably run this about 10 more

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,879
times

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,200
before it was actually due in a few days

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,920
and this was only because i couldn't get

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,959
enough

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,159
of seeing it run my

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,120
professor he recognized the passion that

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,920
i have for this

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,040
and how good i seem to be at it and he

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,560
asked me

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,599
why wasn't i a computer science major

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,959
and i explained to him that i don't know

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,120
what that is

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,319
what is it that a computer scientist

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,720
does

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:19,519
and this is what they do he explained

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,720
so he encouraged me to change my major

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,520
to computer science

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,919
and i must admit the thought of writing

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,040
these

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,560
fun programs for a living sounded really

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,160
exciting

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,400
so finally i found what i was meant to

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,400
do

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,479
i got to wondering is my story

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,199
unique well there's only one way to find

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,040
out

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,240
i'm going to take you to my favorite

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,520
research site

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,639
twitter to see when others

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,639
learned how to code

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,199
so there was a tweet and it asks how old

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,840
were you

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:05,520
when you typed your first line of code

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:08,800
brenton says that he was seven years old

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,840
and he wrote a really simple ascii

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,479
art soccer game in basic

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,160
one afternoon after school second grade

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,320
you know no big deal

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,560
um he said that his dad wrote ninja

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,600
turtles game with him when he was much

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,880
younger

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,440
so he started pretty early chris says

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,280
that he was 10 years old

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,759
and he even remembers some of the

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,199
commands here

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:39,520
shane was eight and uh he did logo

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:42,720
on apple too gregory was seven

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,039
and he remember also using basic and he

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,560
had one of those newspapers with

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,560
the game instructions

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:56,880
tom was also eight he used q basic

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,880
i used it to say hello to you before

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,080
playing a tune on the pc

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,960
pretty cool frederick was about 10 years

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,080
old

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,880
um he remembers in

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,560
infinite alerts in javascript and his

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:15,919
dad had to quit the browser

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,919
kevin he was ten

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,199
brian was nine he had one of those books

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,240
in the 80s

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,800
and he also remembers the you know code

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,440
along

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,000
instructions and he made a cool little

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,039
shark

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,800
fighting game ali was 19.

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,880
it was in her first computer science

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,160
class

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,160
taylor was 20

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:46,840
christina was 20.

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,800
caira was 24 taught herself on code

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,080
academy

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:56,479
jen was 22.

00:06:52,080 --> 00:07:00,800
carla was 28 and mclean was

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:03,919
51. that's pretty cool

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,960
so this got me to thinking

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:10,000
why was there such an

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,360
age difference between when the males

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,960
learn to code

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,759
versus the females obviously

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,720
women enjoy coding so how come they

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,199
didn't start

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,199
earlier

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,400
well let me take you on a quick trip

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,120
back to the 80s

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,080
so that we could see what exactly was

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,080
going on back then

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,080
when it comes to video games nobody

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,520
compares to atari i find in television

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,720
more sophisticated and

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,520
lifelike gentlemen move over for my

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,240
friend vic

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,759
the commodore bit 20. move over the

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,319
commodore vic-20 does more than your

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,560
machines

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,360
it's a great computer that also plays

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,879
great games

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,240
like this and this and this a computer

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,840
that plays great games

00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,840
under 300.

00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,800
[Music]

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,800
so what did you notice in that

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,039
commercial

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,080
well there wasn't a single woman in

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,199
there

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,879
and it seemed to be aimed at gaming

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,960
right okay let's look at another one

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,479
some people have big plans after school

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,400
you know what elliot's gonna do

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,319
jeff too elliot's at work on a book

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,440
report using scripts it on radio shack's

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,680
color computer 3

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,680
it hooks up to his tv and jeff's at his

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,120
radio shack color computer 3 playing the

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,200
newest football game

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,320
but wait what's elliot doing playing new

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,080
super pitfall and

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,159
jeff's having a blast with a new math

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,000
tutor you never know what you might try

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,560
with more than 100 programs for fun and

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,320
learning

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,080
radio shack's color computer 3 comes

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,200
with everything you see here other items

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,320
each sold separately

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,200
only at radio shack so

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,240
there were some girls in that one we saw

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,360
them get off the bus

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,760
before and after elliott and jeff

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,800
who knows what they were going to do but

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,279
we do know

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,160
that jeff and elliot were going to their

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,120
computers

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,160
after school right and we even saw one

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,120
of the boys

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,720
sister come over and kind of look over

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,279
his shoulder to see

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,080
what he was doing as if she thought it

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,200
was cool

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,240
but no way she would actually use the

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,519
computer

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:25,519
right let's watch another

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:28,399
using an apple tube is very easy

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,480
the only hard part is getting your kid

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,480
away from it

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,640
you see apples are the leading computers

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,959
in schools so even though you bought it

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,519
to help you work at home

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,880
your kid will want to use it for his own

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,040
hallmark

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,200
of course if all else fails there's one

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,800
last thing you can try

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,800
get him an apple of his own

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,880
so when this one dad he brought the

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:58,080
computer for himself

00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,880
but his son was glued to it

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,600
right the son was using it for school

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,079
work

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,800
and for leisure so it seems that it's

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,000
for both

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,399
work and hobby and the other activities

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,800
that

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,560
dad tried to get his son involved with

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,160
they just weren't appealing

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,800
only the computer that's all he wanted

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,399
don't we see that with a lot of tech

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,360
bros today where

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,880
you know they kind of expect everyone to

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,320
live and breathe

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:31,360
tech swatch one more

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,200
it's a radio shack merry christmas

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,360
i remember that christmas dad gave me my

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,839
first shortwave radio from radio shank

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,079
with memories this christmas we got our

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,760
son's color computer 3 from radio shack

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,920
it looks right up to our tv and was on

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,160
sale for less than 130

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,680
the color computer 3 makes learning fun

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,480
jimmy even lets me use it for word

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,720
processing

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,350
when he isn't playing computer games

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,320
lucky i still got my short wave

00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:57,120
[Music]

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,880
so this dad he took such pride in

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,120
getting his son this computer for

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,399
christmas and he thought back on

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,360
how special he felt when his dad got him

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,160
a gadget

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,360
when he was a kid you know he wanted to

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,920
do the same for his son

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,640
now we saw this not just in commercials

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,360
but we saw

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,200
the same type of thing in print ads as

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,560
well

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:26,000
there are women here but only as

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,560
eye candy the prize you know

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,120
not interested in the computer but the

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,640
man

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,880
who controls the computer cringeworthy i

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,880
know

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:41,600
look at this one also an ad so this

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,880
ad is actually pointing out that you

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,079
need a computer for

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,959
family needs but there's no complete

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,760
family shown here right it's only the

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,200
boys

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,200
that are shown in this picture

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,399
and then this one we see a family the

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,160
salesman

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:04,959
however is pretty much focused on

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,519
selling to that boy he knows that's

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,839
who's going to use this computer

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,639
now also looking at the body language

00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,079
here

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,760
looks like dad is in control you know

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,680
even though the salesman is selling to

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,360
the boy dad is going to be the one that

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,480
makes the decision

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,760
mom is kind of off to the side you know

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,160
just happy that her boy is gonna get his

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,160
toy

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:35,440
and then they no longer implied it

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,639
they flat out said it and this one it

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,320
says what kind of

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:42,560
man owns his own computer

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,839
letting it be known that this is

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,760
definitely something

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:50,720
for men and boys and here's another

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,800
ad this one is a wanted ad saying that

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,760
there's a huge demand

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,200
now for people not only to buy this but

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,639
to program

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:04,000
these computers well of course

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:06,880
we need men to do this right

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,200
i highlighted a blurb from this ad that

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,800
says you don't have to be a college man

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,320
to get a good job in computer

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,360
programming today

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:21,200
even high school grads are stepping into

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:24,079
excellent jobs with big futures

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,880
this narrative was even prevalent in pop

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,480
culture

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,200
so movies such as war games glorified

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,639
the

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:35,680
hacker culture there was revenge of the

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,560
nerds i like this movie right this one

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,279
was where

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,160
the nerds are cooler than the jocks and

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,279
they're still

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,720
in their girls there were movies like

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:49,760
weird science where these techies were

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,120
able to program their dream girl

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:56,959
now the power of marketing

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,279
is not one to be underestimated

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,079
and there were some pretty strong

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:05,120
messages

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:08,240
in the 80s about who computers were for

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:11,760
here are some of the quotes that i found

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:14,320
about the power of marketing

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,519
it says marketers have advertising down

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,720
to a science

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,240
they research and they analyze consumer

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:25,519
behavior

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:28,639
and we're conditioned from an early age

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:31,440
to pay attention to the messages that

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:35,839
marketers present to us

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:39,360
very smart creative crafty people

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,760
are tweaking your brain to get you to

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,040
want

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,440
something or to buy something

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,600
and while you might think that you're

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,519
arriving at a conclusion

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:55,040
completely on your own i promise you

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:58,320
marketing played a role in some way

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,720
marketing is so powerful that it can

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,320
shape

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:07,440
our values and beliefs and we're

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:10,000
often not even aware that it's happening

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,959
so what were some of the subliminal

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,720
messages

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:18,880
that we saw in the marketing

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:22,720
in the 80s around computers well we saw

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:27,839
that computers are toys for boys

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,839
smart boys geeky boys

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,000
definitely boys

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:40,160
so what were the consequences of this

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:43,759
well we just so happened to see a

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,279
sharp decline in the number of women who

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,639
were studying

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:50,959
computer science right along this same

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,920
time

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,600
npr did a study to show this dip in the

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,800
80s

00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,959
where the other sciences women were

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,320
still going kept going up for them but

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,920
computer science

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:10,959
specifically had a sharp decline

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,959
and we never quite recovered from that

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:18,480
those who did study cs they felt

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:22,079
out of place they didn't have as much

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:25,920
experience with computers they didn't

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:28,959
have stories to brag about

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:32,560
they didn't live breathe and

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,959
sleep computers and they didn't feel

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,560
like

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:40,240
they could ever catch up

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:43,759
so who do we blame for this do we blame

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:47,120
the marketers of the 80s do we blame

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:49,600
the guys who tinkered as boys

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,240
do we blame the women for not getting

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,160
involved

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:58,560
sooner no

00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:02,000
we blame no one this isn't about blame

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,360
this isn't a guilt trip no one should

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,360
feel bad

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,480
if they were introduced to tech at a

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,240
young age that's

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:13,360
beautiful it's wonderful

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:17,919
but we're problem solvers

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:21,199
by nature and clearly we have a problem

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,839
one way to fix this is to introduce

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,439
underrepresented children to tech

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,559
earlier

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,840
so it pained me to think that there

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,200
could be

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:36,559
several others just like me who

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:39,200
never heard about tech as a field

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,000
who never played or tinkered with

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,640
computers

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,039
as kids who you know never had those

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,400
magazines

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:51,440
and thinking of them missing out on this

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,280
wonderful joyous career simply because

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,400
they've never heard of it

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,600
kind of breaks my heart so i set out to

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,960
introduce

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:04,320
young girls to tech but

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,760
i worked a full time job as well so

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,960
i don't necessarily have the time

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:14,640
to change the entire industry

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,640
at least not by myself so i began to

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,760
search for organizations that

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,280
were already doing this type of work

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,240
and i found two black girls code in tech

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,200
girls

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,799
and both of these organizations work to

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,720
expose girls

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:35,760
to hands-on coding projects

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,080
so black girls code mission is to train

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,679
a

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:43,039
million black girls how to code by 2040

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:46,480
and this group targets girls uh

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:49,360
to between the ages of 7 and 17

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,080
and they put the girls into different

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,679
classes

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:56,880
based on their age so there may be one

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,600
for girls under 10. and then another one

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,440
for girls

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:04,160
ages 10 to 12 and then 13 and older

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,919
and this program was actually perfect

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,120
for my schedule because

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:11,520
they host an event like once a month or

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,840
so on a weekend right so it'll usually

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,039
be on a saturday from maybe

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:20,320
10 a.m to 4 p.m but there

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,280
are a variety of volunteer options

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,240
available

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,760
so if you want to teach a class which i

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,720
did sometimes

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,600
you take an all-day ship okay but

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,559
there's also an

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,480
option to be a teacher's assistant where

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,039
you can sign up for just the morning

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,039
shift

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:42,640
or an afternoon shift so if i had an

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:46,640
entire saturday to volunteer i teach

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:49,280
if not i grab one of the shorter shifts

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,400
also this is a one-time commitment right

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,919
i don't have to go

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,799
every saturday just whenever i'd like to

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,440
you know if i'm in the mood if i'm in

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,400
town

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,679
if i have that day open it's a wonderful

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,320
way to give back

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,039
so this worked really well for me and

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,760
then tech girls tech girls is open to

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,880
all girls who are in middle school

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,000
and research shows that this is right

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,919
around the time

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
when these girls start to lose interest

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,200
in things like science and math

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,840
right um and based on the small

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,799
sample of twitter research that we

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,320
reviewed

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,039
we see that this was a critical age for

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,799
boys

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:35,520
when exploring tech so tech girls they

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,320
also do these periodic events but

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,400
there's

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:43,600
usually about three hours or so

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,320
and theirs is typically on a weeknight

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,559
so this is also great for my schedule if

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,960
i didn't have a weekend to volunteer

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:54,480
then maybe i could do you know a tuesday

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:58,080
evening after work or so

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,559
we teach the girls all kinds of fun

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,559
things

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:06,159
for example in this javascript workshop

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:09,520
we go into chrome dev tools we have

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,919
the girls make little small programs

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,039
right

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,919
starting with things as simple as an

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,320
alert

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,159
you know if that's your first hello

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,600
world and you make something pop up

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,320
that's pretty cool

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,679
and then we move on to variables and by

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,559
the end of that session

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,080
which again is only a couple of hours by

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:31,120
the end of that session

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:34,559
they have written a full program

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,760
to maybe calculate the tip on a

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,919
restaurant bill

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,360
you know um and print that out to the

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,440
console

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:46,320
so javascript is the language of the web

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,559
so for the girls to grab this skill at

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,600
such an early age

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,840
imagine the doors that are opening for

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,840
them

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,760
in this one the girls create virtual

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,039
chat boxes

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,559
and they program the computer to guess

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:06,159
their inputs

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:08,400
ai is a hot space right now so imagine

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:11,440
the seed that we're planning

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,280
by sparking their interest in this on

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,640
one random saturday

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,159
you know we also taught them how to

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,760
build a game

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,919
using mit app inventor and what's so

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,480
great about these types of workshops is

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,440
that

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,360
we teach them you know the fundamentals

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,480
and then we just allow them to

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,039
explore and do stuff on their own so

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,320
they are

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:39,039
able to come up with their own game

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,280
think it up you know and then build it

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:44,720
and you'd be amazed

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:47,600
by the creativity of these young girls

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,200
so we allowed those who wanted to to

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,600
demonstrate their games

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,760
at the end of the workshop and they do

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:57,200
this in front of the other students

00:22:53,760 --> 00:23:01,360
as well as the parents who've come back

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,360
and i vividly remember a seven-year-old

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,039
and she was playing the game that she

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,440
built in front of

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,919
everyone huge crowd so she got in front

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,840
of this she wasn't nervous or anything

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:17,520
and as someone who has studied

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:20,799
and built games myself i was in awe

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:24,000
seeing how she had all of the elements

00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:27,360
of a perfect game she had engagement

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,400
she had addiction she had just the right

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,320
amount

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:35,600
of a challenge and i left there

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:38,799
feeling so inspired

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:42,799
this young girl was clearly gifted

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:46,400
and maybe i played some small role

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:48,880
in showing her a joyful avenue

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,000
for her gift we did another session with

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,400
the girls with python

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,320
and raspberry pi and we call this one

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,440
the parent detector

00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:00,640
which is basically a motion detector

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,679
which records video when it senses

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,400
movement in the room so we had the girls

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,760
connect

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:10,960
the motion detector write python

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,240
code to have the camera record upon

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,200
sensing movement

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,840
and then save the recording to a file

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,919
and

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,080
i remember when the girls came to this

00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,320
workshop so it's after school

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,440
and they were kind of trickling in one

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,600
by one

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,520
and the volunteers helped the first few

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,080
girls get set up

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,640
and then i remember as the next wave of

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,240
girls

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,559
trickled in without prompt

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,640
the girls who were already set up went

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,120
over to assist the new girls

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,120
and get them set up and this had a

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,320
domino effect with each

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:49,360
group helping the newcomers

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,240
and i also remember that this workshop

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,760
was a hit

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,880
so we had more girls show up then we had

00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:00,000
raspberry pies and i remember the girls

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,880
openly inviting others to pair with

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,919
them and let me tell you this was the

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:09,600
best pairing sessions i've ever seen

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:13,200
no one played the bad no one you know

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:17,600
dominated it was just genuine

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:20,799
natural mutual learning together

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,960
unfortunately we don't hear a lot of

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,039
women in tech describe their work

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,080
environments in this way

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:31,799
and i think having them experience this

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:35,200
as young girls will give them that

00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:37,120
untainted taste for tech that

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,360
will hopefully encourage them to stay in

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,440
the field even when things get a little

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,480
rough

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,840
now when i talk about volunteering i

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,200
sometimes see a peak of interest on my

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,840
colleagues face

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,640
or they may even say wow you know that's

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,200
a great

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,919
thing that you're doing with the girls

00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,440
but it doesn't necessarily dawn on them

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:04,559
that they can help out too so i started

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:07,440
actively encouraging my male colleagues

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:11,360
to volunteer as well

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:14,720
and they actually came

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,400
so here's another guy who came one of my

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,120
colleagues

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,120
and here's some more and you know what

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,760
they had a great time

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,200
helping the girls so this is definitely

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,039
something that you know

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,120
if you're if you're a guy you don't have

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,279
to leave this to the few women

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,240
who are in the space you can help out

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,039
too

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,120
same goes for black girls code right

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,840
even non-black women

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:42,000
weren't sure if they should help with

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,840
black girls cold

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,279
but there's only so much that i can do

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,600
and other black women

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,520
can do so we definitely welcome all the

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,840
help that we can get

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,159
and i invited the women out some women

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:59,279
that i worked with and look at them

00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,760
front and center they had an amazing

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,360
time

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:06,960
and you know were able to give back

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,240
now i set out on this quest to spark the

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,440
joy of coding in

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:14,000
others but i must admit i

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,840
always leave these workshops just so

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,360
rejuvenated

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:23,120
sharing my passion with them seeing them

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:27,440
light up and produce their own artifacts

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:31,440
returns a new joy to me

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:34,080
so that's my small contribution

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,919
to the next generation i hope that

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,520
you'll also consider

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,559
sharing your joy of coding with them as

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:45,360
well

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:45,360
