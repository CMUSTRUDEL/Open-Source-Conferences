	Tropes! Cliches! Made-Up Slang! It’s the Data-Sitters Club! by Quinn Dombrowski

Did you ever pick up a “Baby-Sitters Club” book in the 90’s, or stumble across the graphic novels or Netflix series more recently? The “Baby-Sitters Club” turns out to be an amazing corpus for exploring computational text analysis methods! Find out what the “Data-Sitters Club” has learned – about these books, natural-language processing (in multiple languages), collaboration, and coding – in this quick tour of our discoveries so far!

Quinn loves languages, digital humanities, and sewing brightly-colored clothes, and can often be found on Twitter at @quinnanya. Quinn works in the Library and the Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages at Stanford University, but lives in Berkeley with a husband, three small kids, and two geriatric cats.

hi

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,760
if you ever experienced or were adjacent

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,640
to 80s and 90s girlhood in the u.s

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,880
you've probably heard of the

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,400
babysitter's club it's a series of books

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,760
by anna martin and the team of ghost

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,279
writers about a group of teen and

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,119
pre-teen girls who form a club that

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,039
matches parents with a young babysitter

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,720
committed to quality child care

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,320
they also solve mysteries and go on

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,200
improbable vacations and things like

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,800
that

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,719
this series is such a cultural

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,559
touchstone with ongoing impacts like

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,719
new graphic novel adaptations a hit

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,640
netflix series a documentary on asian

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,360
american fashion icon character claudia

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,879
kishi

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,559
and a book coming out this summer we are

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,160
the babysitters club with now adult

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,520
readers reflecting on their relationship

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,000
with the series

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,440
what you might be less familiar with is

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
digital humanities or

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,920
dh an uneasily defined academic

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,480
subspecialty where people among other

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,320
things

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,920
apply computational methods to research

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,960
questions in literature history and

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,119
other fields

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,200
humanities academia in general is very

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,920
serious there is really not a cultural

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,479
equivalent to

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,280
can it run doom even the word serious is

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,200
a compliment

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,640
there's not a lot of space for fun and

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,080
what's worse copyright makes it

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,479
impossible to publicly share text

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,080
corpora of anything after 1924

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,759
which is to say anything that most

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,840
normal people would have ever enjoyed

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,600
outside of maybe high school english

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,640
also there's not a lot of university

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,000
courses on learning how to do

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,799
computational text analysis on

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,640
literature

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,920
the people who get into it tend to have

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,400
had some prior experience

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,280
uh with c with computational sciences

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,280
and ncs

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,439
so you can probably see where this is

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,000
going dh doing computational text

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,840
analysis

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,200
has a lot of white guys working on very

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,479
serious old literature

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,920
and many of them are awesome and put

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,040
together tutorials and try to make the

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,720
field welcoming

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,000
but the resources out there tend to be

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,880
shaped by that perspective and

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,880
background

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,560
so this is our story about how we set

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,399
out to create an alternate path in

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,600
for folks like ourselves who started off

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,040
more comfortable with the babysitter's

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,600
club made-up slaying than psychic learn

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,040
so fall 2019 my husband and i left our

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,399
three small children in the mostly

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,160
capable hands of his parents

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,319
and hopped on a plane to las vegas for a

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,000
week it was our first vacation in four

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,640
years and i promised i wouldn't do any

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,640
work

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,080
since my work is focused on doing dh for

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,680
non-english literature i thought to

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,360
myself what a great chance to try out

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,640
working with english for a change

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,080
i came across an article about the

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,599
babysitter's club with an interview with

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,360
my friend shannon supple who curates the

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,440
anna martin papers at smith college

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,640
and i realized that's it that's what

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,640
i'll do this week

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,239
so soon i was enjoying a beer amassing a

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,720
corpus of these books and tweeting about

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,560
it

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,319
and discovered that more than a few of

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,519
my digital human's friends were in fact

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,720
walking encyclopedias of the

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,840
babysitter's club

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,000
they were interested in exploring

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,040
computational text analysis too and so

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,640
before long

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,879
the six of us formed the data centers

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,879
club lee scalar at bessette katya bowers

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,959
maria such goes to siri a new cling

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,720
rubicarism and me

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,000
but i also can't forget mark algae

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,680
hewitt the director of the stanford

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,599
literary lab one of the most famous dh

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,519
text analysis labs in the world

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,120
just like logan bruno he's our token guy

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,400
data sitter but he doesn't take the

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,000
extra work off our hands

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,519
he's our expert bridge to what you can

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,720
and can't do with computational text

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,040
analysis

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,040
so we started writing these books where

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,560
we take some dh method or topic and talk

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,840
in detail about how we applied it to

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,680
this corpus and why

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,120
all written in very casual colloquial

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,480
way designed to be readable for someone

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,640
with no technical background

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,080
but an interest in these books we also

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,400
write with a lot of exclamation marks an

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,080
average of 30 per book

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,360
one of the things that we explored was

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,080
what changes have been made in later

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,599
editions

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,959
did they actually run with a text from

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,080
the 80s when they republished the books

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,599
in the 2000s

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,680
we looked at a bunch of different tools

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,360
but the most usable was diff mash patch

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,200
which showed there were some changes

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,319
stacy's fluffy blonde perm became a

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,760
fancy haircut

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,440
janine no longer reached around to the

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,840
back of the computer to turn it off

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,879
and happily the word thong was replaced

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,720
with flip-flop

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,480
we were ecstatic we had found a thing

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,640
there were emails flying wildly

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,920
until maria who's actually a professor

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,480
of children's literature and childhood

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,680
studies

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,200
worked up the courage to burst our

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,280
bubble pointing out that this happens

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,120
all the time in children's literature

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,799
seeing these changes might be fun but

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,920
it's not actually a new scholarly

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,159
discovery

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,680
and maria wrote about that in dsc number

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,720
three the truth about digital humanities

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,959
collaborations

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,799
and textual variants what i thought was

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,080
going to be a guide to text comparison

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,879
ended up being about something more

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,799
important

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,479
uh speaking up when your friends have

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,880
gone off the rails with with something

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,120
that

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,800
isn't what it seems and that's become

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,199
part of how we write all these books we

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,960
write our feelings frustrations doubts

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,919
and those things that equal space along

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,520
with the code we've also been collecting

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,800
as many translations of the babysitters

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,560
club as we can

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,280
the series appeared at least in part in

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,800
around 20 languages in the 90s and 2000s

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,320
and the release of the netflix series

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,520
has spurred a new wave of translations

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,040
in the last year

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,720
it's been really interesting to look at

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,320
different translation strategies

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,919
by and large these books are not getting

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,880
adapted to the local context of their

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,800
readers

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,400
they aren't treated as timeless stories

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,759
of female friendship

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,600
that just need some tweaking to be made

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,800
more familiar for their audiences their

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,960
allure it seems

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,000
is typically as american stories about

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,759
american girls

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
engaging in american entrepreneurial

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,520
capitalism in america

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,039
we stumbled into looking at the french

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,199
translations in depth first and it

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,120
turned out to be a great choice

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,240
the series was translated three separate

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,600
times into french

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,120
in quebec where they did change the

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,440
locale the girls live in a suburb of

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,680
montreal and stacy is from toronto

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,039
in belgium where the stories were

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,039
unusually

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,479
extremely localized the girls live in a

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,479
paris suburb

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,320
and jesse originally from the only black

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,080
family in stony brook connecticut

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,479
moved from burkina faso in the belgian

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,759
translation and later in france where

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,120
everything is set in america just like

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,039
the original books

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,960
but even for books that aren't localized

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,720
some concessions often have to be made

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,360
the babysitter's club is littered with

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,479
american brand names especially for food

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,160
spaghettios gatorade twinkies we started

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,120
to wonder what did the translators do

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,120
with it all

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,560
so by compiling a list of food words in

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,440
the text where we had multiple french

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,440
translations

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,199
i i wrote some code to run the english

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,479
text through wordnet a giant database

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,639
that classifies english words into

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,720
certain categories including foods

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,919
that was a start but it was good that i

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,520
manually checked some things that were

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,199
classified as not food

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,280
because it turns out that wordnet thinks

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,000
that the primary meaning of hot dog is

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,120
daredevil

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,080
and hot dog is not a food maybe it has a

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,840
point

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,520
i use this data to train an enemy

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,160
recognition model on food words using

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,160
spacey

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,360
to make it easier to find food words in

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,800
other texts

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,880
once we identified all the english

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,720
sentences with food words we use an

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,639
algorithm called blue align to line up

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,479
the english text with the translations

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,240
so that all the sentences that match one

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,919
another had the same line number

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,000
this made it easier to compare the text

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,440
and see how different words got adapted

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,880
leigh and our belgian data sitter

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,000
isabelle gibbermann took a look at the

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,880
results and made some surprising

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,479
discoveries

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,800
there were some creative adaptations

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,199
like turning spaghettios into osobuco a

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,360
complicated tomato sauce and veal dish

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,639
a lot of generalizations like making m

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,479
m's just chocolate

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,160
and at least one explanatory footnote

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,440
for readers which you might not have

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,720
imagined that gatorade would be the

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,919
thing that necessitates a footnote in

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,759
children's literature

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,039
but here we are so in dsc number six

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,960
voyance big day

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,560
katya used the fun text exploration

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,080
environment voyant tools developed by

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,280
the late stefan sinclair to tackle one

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,479
of the most memorable quirks of the

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,680
babysitter's club

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,120
if you've read these books you might

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,080
remember that they're marginal or

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,759
made-up sling

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,160
which has to be explained in every book

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,000
where it occurs fresh means cool and

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,800
there's also dibble which is short for

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,800
incredible

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,479
which sometimes occurs as dibbly so

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,880
something could be referred to as

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,800
dibbly fresh we remembered this language

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,560
being all over the series but using some

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,319
of voyan's concordance functionality

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,840
and lining up the books chronologically

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,720
there's only a small handful of books

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,240
where it appeared

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,840
and it's most commonly associated with

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,520
reader anti-favorite malory

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,880
whose claims that everyone in the club

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,840
uses this language aren't actually

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,680
supported

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,919
maybe mallory is just an unreliable

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,280
narrator who keeps trying to make fetch

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,400
happen

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,000
another infamous feature of the

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,360
babysitter's club is its repeated use of

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,440
tropes in chapter 2

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,120
which in every single book reliably

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,720
recaps the basics of who the characters

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,160
are and what the deal is with the club

00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,840
we wondered how similar are these

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,919
chapter twos anyways

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,520
and if you look at other chapters

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,440
compared across the books in this heat

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,280
map based on cosine similarity using

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,440
word frequencies where darker means

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,120
more similarity you can see that chapter

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,879
twos in the big picture

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,960
are indeed much more similar to one

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,800
another than other chapters are

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,479
we also used some fuzzy text matching

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,280
code created by scott enderly to find

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,360
six grams

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,960
shared by different chapter twos trying

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,120
to identify what makes a given pair of

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,479
chapter twos more similar to each other

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,560
this gave us a network of the books with

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,240
a high amount of repetition we tried

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,520
color coding the network by which

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,719
character was the narrator

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,880
but that didn't give us a lot of

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,959
explanatory power but

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,320
when we color coded it by ghostwriter it

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,599
became really clear that the writers

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,000
were mostly ripped off their own

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,959
phrasing

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,560
from other books they had written so

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:45,519
attending bang mencon has been a delight

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,640
and an inspiration

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,760
i don't often get to share what we're

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,920
doing in the data centers club with

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,080
people who so openly embrace joy whimsy

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,839
and a sense of why not with their work

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,000
the thought occurs maybe literature is

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,320
something like a poorly documented api

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,480
it contains wonderful things that you

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,160
can access with the help of computation

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,279
and maybe there's even scholarship that

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,160
can point the way towards interesting

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,680
things to explore

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,360
like notes from people who've tried to

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,560
access the api before

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,839
what if you treated the books you've

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,440
loved like data sets that you could

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,279
explore and appreciate in new ways even

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,880
if there's no straightforward way in

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,560
if you find something cool or get

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,680
hopelessly tangled in text i'd love to

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,399
hear about it introduce you to a

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,360
community of people

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,839
grappling with the mysteries of

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,839
