Description: 
	Geometric derivations of RGB colorspace! The strange eyeball science that is messing with your LEDs by Laura Kurup

It’s hard to write code that smoothly fades RGB LEDs between colors. But why? Lots of libraries offer solutions, but exploring the problem quickly opens up a neon rainbow hexacone of complexity. Our eyes don’t perceive color in a linear way, and humans have been trying to solve this with math since color screens were introduced. Come along on my visual journey into the eyeball, through the strange history of colorspace models to adjust for color perception, and my attempts to update my code!

hi

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,760
good morning i'm going to be talking

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,199
about leds and

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,480
eyeballs today so i am not an expert in

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,279
either of these topics

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,199
but during the pandemic i discovered

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,160
building hardware and electronics it all

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,320
started with a kit

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,000
to assemble this clock i didn't really

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,079
know what i was doing but i was

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,920
fascinated and i loved looking up what

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,680
every piece was and trying to understand

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,920
as i put this together

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,840
i've worked in data and technology for a

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,520
long time so i've written a lot of code

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,480
that's in web apps websites data

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,160
pipelines

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,680
but they're all a little abstract and

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,399
when i close my laptop at the end of the

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,320
day

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,920
it's not tangible and in my living room

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,640
so this was magical to me

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,559
and led to all kinds of ideas most of

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,199
which i haven't built yet but i'm diving

00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,920
in

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,320
to create interactive physical things

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,719
and

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,680
most of them for me come back to color

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,920
unfortunately

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,600
turns out this was a little tricky and i

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,799
was really confident that was going to

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,280
be an easy part

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,720
and i definitely ran into trouble so

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,680
today i'm going to share with you a

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,759
quick refresher on the basics of leds

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,520
where i ran into trouble three specific

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,520
spots and then what i learned on my

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,880
journey to understand

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,000
so this is a rgb led and you may have

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,119
seen them like this as well

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,880
they're very common today in strips and

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,040
if you get the right kind you can

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,720
control each of the leds individually

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,560
setting brightness or color

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,720
but all of these whether the former or

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,439
the latter actually have three lights

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,720
inside

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,079
every led a red green and blue turns out

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,360
this is all you need to make

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:50,720
millions of colors so i hooked up this

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:54,000
was my first time hooking up my rgb led

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,000
i'm ready to go and this is how you set

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,520
values not not the color picker on the

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,320
right but setting values for

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,840
rgb it's typically a number between 0

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,000
and 255

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,600
and you would set that for red green and

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,560
blue that's because

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,760
one 8-bit byte holds 256 integers or

00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,040
0-255 so that's the way we've always

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,360
stored these values

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,599
and it lives on in color pickers like

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,400
paint and other things you see

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,000
so i'm ready to go i'm ready to move

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,840
through my millions of colors

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,200
and i think i'm going to hold brightness

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,879
or luminance steady

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,959
and so this should be easy right i'm

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,920
just going to slowly decrease red as i

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,120
increase green

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,959
and so on and so forth and i think as i

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,280
do that i'll get this nice color fade

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,319
i'll do the same with green and blue

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,800
so here was my code pretty simple every

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,440
five

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,480
milliseconds i am rotating through and

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,319
i'm going to be

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,000
decrementing one color until it's zero

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,120
while i increment another color until

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,920
it's 255

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,239
then switch to the next set of colors so

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,959
this

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,760
definitely gave me some glowy gradient

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,400
but it wasn't

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,720
quite what i expected the weirdest thing

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,680
is it seemed to pulse with lightness at

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,200
different times

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,680
i thought i was holding the brightness

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,319
steady so the brightness seemed to

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,159
change

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,440
to vary when i was only trying to change

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,159
the hue

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,760
so okay well these colors kind of looked

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,560
washed out how can i get the colors i

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,480
really want

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,959
well there's all kinds of rgb color

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,800
pickers online and as you can see

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,560
they're not all constant brightness to

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,760
create navy or dark blue

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,720
you need to have much lower values

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,200
this was my first clue that brightness

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,280
is

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,799
intrinsically tied to color and you

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,159
can't separate the two

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,480
and this means there are a lot of

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,159
optical illusions where two colors that

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,519
appear to be the same brightness

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,680
if you grayscale them they're

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,239
drastically different but it's because

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,280
of how we

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,120
perceive brightness for that color

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,360
so at the end of the day it was still

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,280
hard to create the hues that i expected

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,120
and so i started building more clocks i

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,959
was on this path to build clocks

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,720
and i've used a bunch of different

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,959
digits these are

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,519
a maker built these uh and they're on

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,360
rgb digit.com you can find them on tindy

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,239
different people putting together

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,200
rgb leds into different combinations of

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,040
digits

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,400
and i wanted to do these beautiful

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,799
gradients so

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,560
maybe at sunrise every day um there

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,840
would be some kind of animation and the

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,320
clock could be bright

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,840
vibrant blue colors during the day and

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,639
overnight so it wouldn't screw with my

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,600
night vision

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,759
it could get deep red and orange so i

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,160
did a lot of manual color picking

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,840
but at the end of the day i programmed

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,759
the clock during the daytime

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,759
and i just scaled everything down

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,400
linearly to the brightness i wanted at

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,840
night

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,240
and it didn't look good um it there were

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,120
things that the color wasn't what i

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,040
expected

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,720
or where i was had a refresh rate where

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,400
i was updating the color you couldn't

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,520
perceive it with the naked eye at all

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,960
when it was bright

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,720
all of a sudden at midnight i could

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,840
almost see it flickering what was going

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,919
on

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,680
so there are libraries that fix this but

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,639
i want to talk a little bit about what

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,160
the problem was

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,160
because it wasn't my code and it wasn't

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,720
my hardware which i did wonder

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,560
for a moment turns out this is actually

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,000
how we perceive color

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,560
one note that as much as one out of

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,199
eight

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,800
men and one out of 200 women have some

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,240
type of colorblindness

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,919
and so while that's important to

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,120
remember certainly for design and

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,639
communication

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,440
um there may be folks who don't see this

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,120
presentation the same way i might

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,360
so here's what i remembered about the

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,840
eye they're cones and rods right

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,280
and this is how i imagined them and even

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,800
though there are millions i'm like okay

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,560
these are sticking sticking on the back

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,440
of my eye and that's about as much as i

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,199
remembered

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,600
well turns out rods actually look like

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,160
this and there are around 120 million of

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,039
them

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,400
and they're around 6 million cones i

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,880
also had imagined

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,479
and often times you'll see it oriented

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,919
this way in papers or books

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,840
that the cones and the rods were the

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,840
thing the light was hitting first

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,039
turns out that's upside down and the

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,280
light actually is

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,120
passing through this layer of nerves and

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,720
nerve cells before it gets to those

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,800
photoreceptors

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,560
they're also not distributed evenly

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,639
right in the middle of our eye we have a

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,160
really extreme density of cones

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,720
and the rods are more on our peripheral

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,560
vision my favorite way to play with this

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,840
if you haven't tried this is when you're

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,840
looking at stars

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,360
you can often find a star in the sky

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,479
that you can see it out of your

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,880
peripheral vision

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,080
if you look straight at it it disappears

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,880
look just to the side

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,280
it reappears and that's because it's too

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,039
dim

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,039
for your cones which are in the center

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,400
but your rods your peripheral vision can

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,720
see it

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,560
so one thing to know about the cones

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,000
these three photoreceptors we have in

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,639
the back of our eye

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,479
is that they are sensitive to different

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,080
ranges of wavelengths of light

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,160
and they even within those have

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,000
different sensitivities and this is part

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,840
of what explains that glowing brighter

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,919
glowing dimmer effect i saw

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,080
when i was blending linearly through the

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,479
colors

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,520
the trichromatic theory explains why

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,599
these three

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,120
types of cones in our eyes can see

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,440
millions of colors

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,360
so if we have orange and a orange

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,039
wavelength is coming in our eye

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,960
it's going to excite the um

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,880
the red cone the long wave sensitive

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,520
cone and what we often call the green

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,120
cone the medium sensitive cone

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,360
these are made up numbers let's call

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,680
this percent excitement

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,960
but let's say it's going to excite that

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,759
long wave cone

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,680
around 50 and the shortwave cone around

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,199
or the medium wave cone around 10

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,919
and it doesn't hit that shortwave cone

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:31,759
at all that's orange to our eye

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:33,919
50 excitement of the red cone and 10

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,120
excitement of the green cone that equals

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,440
orange

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,639
that means that we can recreate this

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,680
lots of different ways

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,720
so to create orange in the rgb led we

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,720
would be putting in

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,840
a lot of red and a little bit of green

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,319
but to our eye

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,919
that equals the same thing so i'm not

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,800
going to go into the details on this but

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,840
part of what i found

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,639
fascinating was metameric colors

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,319
are colors that don't match the actual

00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,440
wavelength on the spectrum but are built

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,919
different ways

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,599
and you can definitely go into a deep

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,039
wikipedia hole on this

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,879
but there's all kinds of interesting

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,080
failures where you match colors under

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,840
certain conditions

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,520
but then if you look at it from an angle

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,000
illuminate it with a different light

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,520
you can actually see it differently

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,639
there's one more theory that's really

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,400
important to understand

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,160
and it explains how we see an after

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,520
image if you've ever seen those optical

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,039
illusions where you stare at the thing

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,560
on the right and then you look away to a

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,160
white screen but you see the thing on

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,639
the left

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,199
that actually is happening because of

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,520
how

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,399
our photoreceptors are connected to our

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,159
optic nerve

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,800
through these bipolar cells and ganglion

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,080
cells they actually kind of work like

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,240
logic gates

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,839
so all cones can provide input into

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,080
luminance but there are two

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,040
separate systems called the opponent

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,320
systems

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,200
that help those uh nerve cells actually

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,160
interpret

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,560
what it's getting from the cones so we

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,800
can either perceive excitement as red

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,440
or green we can't see both at the same

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,200
time on that particular group of cones

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,880
same thing we can see blue or yellow

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,440
systems but not the same at the same

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,200
time

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,440
this is why you can see reddish blue but

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,959
you can't see reddish green

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,440
it actually turns out that a lot of

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,760
color is really dependent on context

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,440
so here the top center square and the

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,320
front center square are actually the

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,320
same color

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,360
but our eyes are really good at trying

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
to figure out what the lighting

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,920
conditions are

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,519
and then making assumptions based on

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,920
that here's another a

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,279
and b are actually the same color and

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,640
even when we connect them

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,959
it's hard for me to believe that i

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,800
almost see that as a gradient

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,800
color can also depend on the language

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,720
you speak some cultures have

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,480
more names for something that we might

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,519
think about as light blue or dark blue

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,839
or less names

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,600
and folks will actually see those as

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,200
distinct colors or associate different

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,120
meanings with them where we may not see

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,120
the distinction

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,800
so back to the problems i had brightness

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,760
seemed to vary when only changing the

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,279
queue

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,800
it was hard to create the hues that i

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,480
expected and things that looked good

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,760
when right were bad with them

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,480
the stuff that i learned is that

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,720
perception of you is tied to luminance

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,360
and context and you cannot disentangle

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,200
those

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,279
our perception of brightness is not at

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,040
all linear our eyes are much more

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,760
sensitive at low lights because of the

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,440
cones

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,519
and not all humans perceive color the

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,839
same way so a couple

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,680
of things we can do to fix these the

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,079
first is gamma correction

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,880
so this is linear intensity but to my

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,320
eyes and

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,519
likely to yours the step between 0.0 and

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,839
0.1

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,839
seems to be a lot bigger jump than from

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,920
0.9 to 1.0

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,120
so if we scale intensity on a

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,200
logarithmic scale

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,360
we can get it to look linear to our eyes

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,279
even though it actually isn't

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,519
humans have also tried to solve for

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,480
blending colors by creating color spaces

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,279
so if you map

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,320
rgb onto a cube you can get this the

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,480
problem is

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,880
it transitions between the colors won't

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,959
actually look linear to the human eye

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,040
the color wheel picker is really popular

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,279
today too there's hsl and

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,200
hsb that's another way to pick color but

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,560
it's also linear in a way that makes

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,600
sense for rgb

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,839
but doesn't make sense to our eyes so

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,440
there's been color standards committees

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,279
official government colors

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,079
all kinds of ways to try and get us to

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:15,040
agree on what yellow is yellow

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,600
tests that we've run to display lights

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,519
um

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,959
of different colors and have people say

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,560
when they're accurate

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,399
um and then there are color space

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,560
development so the international

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,880
commission on illumination

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,079
created a color space in 1913 that's

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,120
still used today

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:33,040
it's 3d and allows us to measure the

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,440
distance between two colors and to play

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,920
on a path to fade between two colors

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,880
in a way that looks a lot more linear if

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,839
you take away

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,360
the brightness dimension you can look at

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,320
this in a 2d space

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,320
and when you map the rgb color space

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,560
onto the sealab color space

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,240
you can actually see that the rgb didn't

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,880
look very linear to the human eye and

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,720
this is a better attempt to do that

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,560
one final color space and this is a new

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,720
one it came out in 2020.

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,560
um you can google it and if you just

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,920
google okay lab color space you'll find

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,000
it there's a lot of ways to engage with

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,200
it in different programming languages

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,240
but it has three variables but it works

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,399
on predicting

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,360
how to fade color how to translate color

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,760
in a way

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,480
that is going to match human perception

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,639
so here's the rainbow gamut uh using

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,959
okay lab and on the bottom is using that

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,839
hue

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,360
saturation value which actually doesn't

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,279
look like it's holding a constant

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,120
lumosity to the human eye

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,120
it also helps you blend in between

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,000
colors without getting too warm or too

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,320
cool or blending too fast

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
so at the end of the day what i'm now

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,839
doing when i work with leds

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,200
is i'm making sure i do gamma correction

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,240
for the non-linear perception of

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,639
brightness

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,560
i'm still manually fine-tuning to pick

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,320
my favorite hues that exact color of

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,000
purple or red that i want

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,920
but i'm using a color space model to

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,920
figure out how to fade between colors in

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,920
a way that's going to look good

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,279
i am testing separately in different

00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,959
lighting conditions because stuff just

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,600
gets weird when it's dim

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,079
and in a lot of my designs i'm thinking

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,839
about

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,519
how would this look like to a colorblind

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,279
person how would this look given some of

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,680
what i've learned around

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,399
uh cultural significance of color at the

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,040
end of the day

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,800
i know a brain is not a computer but

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,279
i've started thinking of these rods and

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,200
cones

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,720
more like sensors they have a set of

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,360
inputs they work very well for

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,800
they also have limitations and then all

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,800
of these cells they're connected to

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,560
before they even go to your brain is

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,200
like a microcontroller with some logic

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,040
on it

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,560
at the end of the day that impacts how

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,639
we can see color gives us this
