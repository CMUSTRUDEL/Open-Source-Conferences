	Geometric derivations of RGB colorspace! The strange eyeball science that is messing with your LEDs by Laura Kurup

It’s hard to write code that smoothly fades RGB LEDs between colors. But why? Lots of libraries offer solutions, but exploring the problem quickly opens up a neon rainbow hexacone of complexity. Our eyes don’t perceive color in a linear way, and humans have been trying to solve this with math since color screens were introduced. Come along on my visual journey into the eyeball, through the strange history of colorspace models to adjust for color perception, and my attempts to update my code!
