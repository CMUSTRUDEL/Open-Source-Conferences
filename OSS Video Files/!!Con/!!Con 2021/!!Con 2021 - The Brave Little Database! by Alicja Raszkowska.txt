	The Brave Little Database! by Alicja Raszkowska

This is a story about the adventures of the Brave Little Database, who tirelessly handles incoming requests, indexes tables, manages its buffer pool, and works together with its replicas and a proxy server to deliver the best service it can. Weâ€™re going to accompany the hero as it tackles obstacles and learns to be more resilient.

Alicja likes to learn by drawing things. They work on all things infrastructure and have a soft spot for data stores and metrics. Outside of tech, Alicja tirelessly covers everything in yarn and plays ukulele.
