	It’s like you’re actually there! Mouse synchronization in an online tabletop game by Paweł Marczewski

When working on an online tabletop game, I encountered the problem of mouse cursor synchronization. How to make sure my mouse, and the pieces I’m moving, animate correctly and smoothly for the other players? When done well, the effect really adds to the immersion, but there are a few subtle details.

Paweł’s day job involves operating systems, but outside of work, he has always been making games. He likes interactive fiction, Japanese board games (Go and Mahjong), and rock climbing.
