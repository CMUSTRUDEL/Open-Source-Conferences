	Enter the Minus World! Nintendo Cartridges Share Secrets! by Paul Pollack

Secrets in video games are a funny thing. Sometimes they’re gifts from the developers that make you feel like you got somewhere you weren’t supposed to go. Other times… a game winds up in a state it wasn’t built to handle and you actually got somewhere you definitely weren’t supposed to go! Super Mario Bros. for the Nintendo Entertainment System has great examples of both of these kinds of secrets. The Warp Zone is a well-known and beloved portal into later stages of the game. I want to talk to you about another portal, one left completely by accident, that goes somewhere else: The Minus World!

The Minus World is a collection of levels composed entirely of arbitrary junk data in memory! In the US players discovered this place through dexterous maneuvering to outsmart the game’s collision detection logic. The results were fascinating but limited. A single level named “ - 1” (as in Minus World!) that repeated in a loop. I want to share with you all another method to enter this place that gives us access to a whole slew of possible levels! This technique was first discovered by some clever Japanese gamers by swapping out cartridges without turning off the console. As I demonstrate this effect we will talk about which hardware components are involved and exactly what they’re doing every step of the way!

Paul has a lot of hobbies and interests that move in and out of rotation over time. Sometimes he forgets about one for years and then suddenly remembers he liked doing the thing. Among these are electronics, music, mushroom hunting, and watching the Evil Dead trilogy. Paul writes software to make it easier for people to spend time outdoors for The Wanderlust Group.

uh

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,320
welcome to my talk enter the minus world

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,800
nintendo cartridges share

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,320
secrets uh i want to talk to you about a

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,439
console i love the nintendo

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,039
entertainment system

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,519
i also want to talk to you about a game

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,199
i love the super mario brothers game

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,199
uh i also want to talk to you about a

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,320
game i am ambivalent about tennis

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,760
but i'm only going to talk about it

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,279
because it's involved in a cool and

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,000
weird thing we can do in super mario

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,920
bros

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,360
uh so one of the reasons why i like this

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,200
game so much and this is

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,800
definitely not unique about me is that

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,399
there are all these cool secrets

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,480
the warp zone is one of my favorite

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,360
examples it was really cool as a kid to

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,640
be able to

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,399
find a secret room in the back of a

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,360
level and go somewhere far into the

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,360
future in the game

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,719
uh without being actually good enough to

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,199
play the game and get there

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,960
uh i think things like this definitely

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,480
encouraged gamers who are maybe kind of

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,800
tenacious to find

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,320
all the secrets they could eventually

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,440
finding out how to break the game in

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,680
very interesting ways

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,720
uh the minus world glitch here is a very

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,640
famous example

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,400
we can evade the collision detection

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,439
logic in the game and jump in a very

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,799
specific way

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,240
we slide through a wall we go down a

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,200
warp pipe before the proper data is

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,520
loaded into ram

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,119
and we go to this underwater level

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,920
called simply minus one it's missing the

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,560
world

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,240
um when we finish the level we just kind

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,600
of wrap around and start over again

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,200
and we do that over and over and over

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,000
again until we get bored and turn off

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,400
the game or get a game

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,040
over uh this was really cool and people

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,240
were uh

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,320
really excited about it when it was

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,960
discovered nintendo power wrote it up in

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,159
their third

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,680
issue um but it's a little limited right

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,079
i i want to show you something that i

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,880
think is uh cool and not quite so

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,119
limited

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,399
um japanese gamers had figured out a

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,479
technique to get to 256 bizarre worlds

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,759
uh shigeru miyamoto the creator of the

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,840
series was so

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,439
inspired by this that when they made the

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,000
sequel they actually added an extra

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,840
ninth world

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,360
that was uh very reminiscent

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,479
aesthetically of the types of things

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,880
people were finding

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,680
so it's called the undercover trick and

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,439
the reason why

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,520
it was getting a lot of heat in japan

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,119
was because uh you could do it on this

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,200
the famicom the original japanese

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,879
console uh you can also do it on this

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,760
this is the nes 101 top loader that's

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,080
what i do it on

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,599
but that didn't come out until uh very

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,280
late in the life cycle of this console

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,160
at the time us gamers were stuck with

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,680
the nes

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,680
and the reason why they couldn't do this

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,000
trick is because of this horrible beast

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,160
uh this is the 10 nes lockout ship

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,680
it was basically a mechanism that

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,280
nintendo introduced to enforce

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,360
aggressive licensing decisions they made

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,040
when they came to the us console market

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,080
uh unless you had their seal of approval

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,800
they didn't want your game running on

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,560
the console

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,879
so if uh if you didn't have it it would

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,760
go into an in uh infinite reset loop

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,040
um the bad news is that the chip was bad

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,160
and so were some of the mechanical

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,920
elements of the console

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,680
so a lot of consoles went into that

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,120
infinite reset loop for perfectly

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,280
approved games anyway that happened to

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,920
my childhood nes and it was really sad

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,120
um so that aside how do we do the uh

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,720
undercover trick

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,720
we start by playing some super mario

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,640
brothers makes sense uh we want to get

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,760
some of the data in working ram

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,920
and we're just going to hang out on a

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,280
pipe where it's safe uh don't turn off

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,879
the console because we just did a lot of

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,239
hard work and we don't want to erase it

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,640
uh take the cartridge out just like they

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,480
tell you not to put tennis in

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,239
something very interesting happens there

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,120
visually when the cartridge makes

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,040
contact

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,560
uh we'll talk about that in detail we

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,000
reset the console we play a little

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,519
tennis i don't play much tennis because

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,239
it doesn't go very well for me

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,840
um same thing keep the console on remove

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,400
it super mario brothers goes back in

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,680
reset so this is important don't just

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,360
press start because we'll just start

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,200
from the beginning of the game again and

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,959
nothing we just did will matter a plus

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,799
start is a special input that allowed

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,640
you to continue from the last world you

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,400
were on after you got a game over

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,920
um we weren't playing super mario

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,239
brothers though we were playing tennis

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,840
so

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,840
instead we start somewhere very weird

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,400
so uh weird enemy spawns empty item

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,159
blocks hidden underground

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,519
this was clearly not designed right

00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,840
let's look at one more example

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,840
this one's a little less exciting

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,720
what can you do about that so we're

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,000
going to look at another example a

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,879
little later but first i want to show

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,840
you some hardware

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,360
this is the motherboard of the nes on

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,439
the left here we have the cpu

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,040
it's based on the 6502 which was a

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,680
really important microprocessor of this

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,519
era

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,359
uh it was in the apple ii the commodore

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,479
64. there was a variant in the atari

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,479
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,320
uh there's a really fascinating history

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,320
around things nintendo and rico a

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,960
japanese manufacturer they worked with

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,840
did to evade patent law pretty much uh

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,280
because they

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,280
felt like they had to to enter the us

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,040
console market to produce their variants

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,639
um i have a book cited at the end of my

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,840
slides that goes into that in detail and

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,199
i highly recommend it if you're

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,639
interested in learning more

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,800
uh the other trip we're interested in

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,199
here is the ppu the picture processing

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,960
unit

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,800
also made by ricoh this was basically

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,919
like a graphics card as opposed to the

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,240
6502 which was ubiquitous in computers

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,040
this was very unique to the nes it made

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,800
developing

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,040
very very easy compared to the atari

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,479
2600 where programmers had to render

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,680
scanline by scanline

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,680
this abstracted a lot of those

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,960
complexities away um

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,120
we're interested in some stuff on the

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,759
cartridge too i opened up a super mario

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,000
bros

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,280
duck hunt combo cartridge here to show

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,960
you some read-only memory

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,960
uh we have character rom here on the

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,039
left and that is basically graphical

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,720
information it connects right to the ppu

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,320
and on the right we have program rom

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,160
this is source code it's it's the game

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,560
logic that goes right to the cpu

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,600
take note of the very distinct physical

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,759
split in the pins

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,440
uh coming from these chips i think it's

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,840
very illustrative and i hope this

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,960
simplistic diagram is too of how these

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,479
components work

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,160
which is very independently of each

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,080
other uh the cpu

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,000
and ppu each maintain their own

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,960
independent address spaces

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,520
um the cpu has two kilobytes of working

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,199
ram

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,280
uh the program rom takes up takes up a

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,600
lot of space there the ppu is doing a

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,240
lot of stuff with character rom

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,919
background and foreground imagery uh the

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,320
way they communicate predominantly is

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,800
through

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,440
uh these eight bits on the cpu address

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,960
bus

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,440
uh that um are pp registers that

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,160
ppu makes it accessible to the cpu uh

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,000
they do

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,759
um very specific operations one

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,919
important way that this happens is

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,280
uh it allows the cpu to manipulate

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,680
object attribute memory

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,919
uh every frame the cpu can tell the ppu

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,800
where up to 64 sprites can be on screen

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,240
at any given time

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,919
so this is responding to input and

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,680
gameplay so we're playing super mario

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,440
brothers and everything's going well

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,960
and then we do something very rude and

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,039
we unceremoniously remove

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,560
super mario brothers cartridge the cpu

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,319
is mad at us and doesn't want to do

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,759
anything for us anymore but the ppu

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,680
tries to be pretty helpful

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,800
and it still tries to render the last

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,240
data that it had

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,919
uh there's no character rom though so

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,000
there's decay when we put

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,080
tennis in the cpu is still down for the

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,919
count but the ppu says oh cool character

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,199
arm's back uh i know where tiles are

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,240
supposed to be and i know which ones i'm

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,000
supposed to use

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,680
so we have a pipe made out of tennis

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,039
nets we have a mario made out of a

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,440
bizarre assortment of tennis player

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,759
parts

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,560
and we have a status bar that is quite

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,240
readable

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,319
if we look at the way that the character

00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,840
rom is laid out in sequence on these

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,400
cartridges side by side it all makes

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,919
sense

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,759
um and specifically if you look in the

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,520
middle those alphanumeric

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,120
characters are very very similar with

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,160
with very few differences

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,599
um and uh this makes sense

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,120
from a practical standpoint too these

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,759
games were both developed in-house by

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,120
nintendo

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,599
so developers were likely sharing

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,280
resources making their lives easier

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,560
so that kind of explains what happens

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,280
visually when we swap out those

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,720
cartridges

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,960
so what's up with these worlds how can

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,880
copyright world and mushroom worlds

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,880
exist and how come levels actually have

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,440
layouts for them

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,599
the answer lies in an address in ram and

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,639
is hexadecimal 7fd

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,160
uh in this address is stored a byte that

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,039
is the number of steps that we take in

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,280
tennis

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,319
it is also the continue world in super

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,199
mario brothers

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,039
so when we play tennis it changes that

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,360
value to the number of steps we take we

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,199
have

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,560
some pretty good control over that when

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,800
we play super mario brothers

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,680
uh we press a plus start and it fetches

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,440
that byte

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,039
uh typically it expects to go to worlds

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,919
one through eight but this can be

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,160
256 things so uh it kicks off a

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,080
subroutine that uses an offset to go to

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,199
what should be a meticulously laid out

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,280
sequence of bytes

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,879
but it's just kind of an arbitrary place

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,080
in program rom because we started at an

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,840
arbitrary place

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,039
uh so knowing all this let's take one

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,039
last look at the minus world

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,280
sometimes these are really exciting

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,160
sometimes they're not this is

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:27,520
i hope the best one i was able to find

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:29,520
that you all enjoy

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,199
yeah the koopas have very uncharitable

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,840
spawns here it's always a treat to get

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,120
an under

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,399
water level above ground um the thing

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,959
that i really love

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,000
most about all of this is that i think

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,159
it illustrates how

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,480
flexible the design of this game is and

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,200
um it's just kind of strangely beautiful

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,000
what can happen

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,320
if you put the wrong number in the right

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,440
location

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,680
so i have one more quick quick clip that

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,640
i can share with you guys um

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,480
most worlds have four levels uh this one

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,640
has six which is really weird

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,839
but um maybe i don't have too much time

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,320
to get into that after all

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,880
so uh here are some sources that i put

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,640
together

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,560
uh they were super helpful when i was

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,440
doing all this um i am error is a

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,880
fantastic book

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,279
very comprehensive look at the nes and

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,279
famicom uh it kind of

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,560
got me really interested in doing more

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,360
stuff with the nes than just playing

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,800
games on it

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,480
uh legends of localization is a

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,399
fantastic website uh

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,920
typically focused on translation of

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,120
classic games

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,880
the nes dev community is just

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,320
the best place for all kinds of

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,600
technical knowledge on the nes i use

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,160
some tools made by their community

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,320
members

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,000
nest blur is where i was able to load

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,800
rom files and get those character rom

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,720
images

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,000
uh and the disassembly of super mario

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,399
brothers um it's

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,279
it's incredible um it saved me probably

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,040
hours of finding

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,640
what the continue world value is in

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,399
mario i just had to confirm

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,680
that and then find out what it did in

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,399
tennis uh

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,839
i'm planning to stream some minus world

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,399
stuff at some point i'm not a twitch

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,560
streamer

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,080
this could be a huge tire fire uh i've

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,760
confirmed that technically my setup

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,760
works but i don't know uh if you want to

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,360
see minus world stuff or

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,279
something go really bad in real time

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:11,839
check it out thanks again and i hope you

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,839
