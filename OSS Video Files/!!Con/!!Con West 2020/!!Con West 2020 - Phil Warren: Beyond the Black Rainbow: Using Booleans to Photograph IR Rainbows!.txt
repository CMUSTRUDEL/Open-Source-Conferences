Title: !!Con West 2020 - Phil Warren: Beyond the Black Rainbow: Using Booleans to Photograph IR Rainbows!
Publication date: 2020-03-23
Playlist: !!Con West 2020
Description: 
	Presented at !!Con West 2020: http://bangbangcon.com/west

Why are there so many talks about rainbows? And what’s on the other side? Rainbows are visions, but not illusions, and rainbows have something to hide!

Frustratingly, infrared photographers find that they can never photograph the invisible extra stripes beyond red in a rainbow. Instead, they’ll only see a single monochromatic band! We will explore why, and dive into the boolean solution to make a three-channel model that reveals a full -olor unseen world! Then, we’ll look at pictures of a world entirely in a spectrum we can’t see!

Hi.

00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:28,939
I'm Phil Warren.

00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:34,140
I'm a research engineer who works in the field of imagery, both capture and display, and

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,120
when I'm not in the lab, I do the exact same thing, but with my own cameras, and I would

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,870
like to share with you a novel exploration I've been working on.

00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:44,870
Imagine a rainbow.

00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,920
Actually, you don't need to imagine it.

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,920
I'll show you.

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:55,420
This is a pretty good representation of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible light.

00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,210
Light has a wavelength.

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,989
And like everything else on the electromagnetic spectrum, we can perceive everything ranging

00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:09,210
from violet, around 380 nanometers, to deep red, around 720 nanometers.

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:15,740
Now, as we look up at a rainbow, photons rain down upon us like so many droplets of splishy

00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,860
splashy color.

00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:24,880
However, our human eyes can only capture a certain range of those photons.

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,250
Below the blue wavelengths, ultraviolet photon goes unperceived.

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,970
But that’s what not we’re going to talk about today.

00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:36,440
Above the red, infrared photon is likewise not seen.

00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,970
This means the rainbow is hiding something.

00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,500
There are unseen stripes to this rainbow.

00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,260
And not only do I need to see them.

00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,800
I need you to see them too.

00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,500
That's the problem we're gonna solve today.

00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:57,430
Going back to the rain of photons, our awesome human eyes perceive color by catching those

00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:03,340
photons, those droplets of color energy, in cone cells that behave like...

00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,509
Buckets.

00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:07,360
Most people have exactly three buckets.

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,720
And only three buckets in which to catch those photons.

00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:17,450
These buckets, which are actually three kinds of cone cells, are long cones, which capture

00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:23,550
red light, medium cones, which capture green light, and short cones, which capture blue

00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,740
light.

00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:30,540
At this point, our brain is now given color information with these triplet sets of data,

00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,920
a paradigm we call the tristimulus model.

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,610
We never directly perceive the spectrum, because we can never dump out the buckets and sort

00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,990
the droplets to see what specific wavelength that photon was.

00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:50,190
Instead, we can understand intermediary shades of color by observing where the buckets overlap.

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,520
If photons tickle both our red and green cones, we identify yellow or orange.

00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,340
If photons tickle both our green and blue cones, we see cyan or indigo.

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,700
If we wanted to see the hidden stripes of the rainbow, we would have to see the world

00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:10,530
in cones that perceived longer wavelengths, say 760 to 1100 nanometers.

00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,700
Let's figure out how to do that.

00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,120
Cameras, unsurprisingly, are set up to mimic human eyes.

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,120
However, the silicon sensor in the back of a digital camera is by itself and before the

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,360
camera is fully put together actually sensitive to a much wider spectrum.

00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,490
300 nanometers to almost 1100 nanometers.

00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:38,900
Unfortunately, if cameras actually photographed in that range, the photos wouldn't accurately

00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,890
resemble the world the photographer was trying to capture.

00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,120
See the image on the left?

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,340
It doesn't look right at all.

00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:54,099
To ensure that cameras do accurately capture color, a manufacturer would now install a

00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:58,960
hot mirror to bounce back photons invisible to the human eye.

00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,680
This is the camera that gets sold on the market, which accurately captures visible light and

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,550
nothing else.

00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:10,540
In order to divide color from this single sensor, we actually coat it with a very fine

00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,470
array of translucent tiles, a color filter array.

00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,949
This only lets certain wavelengths in to each pixel.

00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:23,400
If we think of each tile as a bucket, again, we end up with a group of three buckets.

00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,930
Again, the digital camera has taken light from the real world spectrum and sorted it

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,160
into a tristimulus model.

00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,720
With a red channel, a blue channel, and a green channel.

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:41,420
Now, you can tear apart a camera and rip out the hot mirror that blocks infrared photons,

00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:46,600
thus returning your sensor to a state where it can catch all the photons, visible and

00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
otherwise.

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,160
In order to photograph our unseen rainbow, we have to do this.

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,230
I wouldn't recommend you do this yourself.

00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:59,370
There's a shocking number of screws in that densely packed nightmare of electronics.

00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:05,940
And moreover, there's a solid chance your camera will never focus again.

00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,880
But there are several shops that you can go to online that will convert your camera for

00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,460
you, to see in the full spectrum.

00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:16,870
Now, if we want to photograph in infrared, we can order fairly inexpensive filters called

00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,080
IR pass filters, which are going to block out all the photons that are visible to the

00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,080
human eye.

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,350
However, if you didn't take apart and modify your camera, all photons are going to be blocked

00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,590
by this filter.

00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:34,330
This is all well and good, but once we allow those photons outside the visible realm onto

00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,550
the color filter array, all bets are off.

00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:43,210
The translucent tiles simply weren't designed for this, so they don't know what to do.

00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:48,190
They all kind of fail the same way, allowing 50% of all infrared light in.

00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:54,220
This means our buckets overlap completely with no differentiation in the infrared spectrum.

00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,800
There's no triplet set of data.

00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,620
No tristimulus model here.

00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,430
This has a weird effect.

00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:04,530
When all the buckets are equally full, it doesn't matter if there's only a little infrared

00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,220
or a whole lot of infrared.

00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:10,820
The result is a traditional infrared photo, with pixels that are gray scale.

00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,820
Monochromatic.

00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:17,720
This is a white balanced version of a conventional infrared photo.

00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,520
We can't photograph secret beyond the black rainbow stripes this way.

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,820
We would only see a white band of light.

00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,820
See?

00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,139
I tried using a camera with a hot mirror ripped out.

00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:34,350
Now, there is an infrared photography community, including myself, that leans into this limitation

00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,460
in style.

00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:40,449
Augmenting the monochromatic infrared with a little visible spectrum and then swapping

00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:46,880
channels to create a cotton candy color, which is artistically beautiful, but does not actually

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,900
offer a color concept of the invisible spectrum.

00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:56,150
Here's where we diverge and truly introduce a novel format.

00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:00,820
Maybe we could reconstruct an infrared rainbow with three different infrared photographs

00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,389
of our rainbow shown here in the visible spectrum.

00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:10,890
Except no filters exist on a consumer market to create the desired buckets on the spectrum.

00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:15,460
We can use the consumer filters I mentioned before that start allowing light in at different

00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,850
points on the infrared spectrum, but they all have no upper terminus.

00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:24,460
They all let in as high of a wavelength as the sensor will allow, meaning they all cut

00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,830
off around 1100 nanometers.

00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:31,140
I used three of these filters, mounting a different one in front of my lens for each

00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,259
shot, to take these photographs.

00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:40,389
One allows in, in nanometers, 760 to 1100 to pass.

00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:46,280
We'll call the result image A. One allows 850 to 1100 to pass.

00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,830
We'll call the result image B. One allows 960 to 1100 to pass.

00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:57,620
We'll call this unsurprisingly image C. And maybe there's a creative way to computationally

00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,810
derive three separate buckets?

00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,919
I took a look at those three photos.

00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:07,970
I took those photos without moving the camera, the light, the subject, or changing any of

00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,240
the settings on the camera.

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,850
It was all just the rainbow that I created using a Xenon bulb and a simple prism.

00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:19,130
Now, let's not forget that we're dealing with a digital image here.

00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,870
So now we can crack open the code and let our true nerd shine.

00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:28,020
I used Python to write my code for this, and remember, any time we're dealing with a digital

00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,910
image, we're really looking at a multidimensional array of integers.

00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,949
What we might call an mxnx3 array.

00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:38,880
Meaning height and width of an image and then three stacks to represent the red, the green,

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,000
and the blue channels.

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,480
Given that these images are really monochromatic, we can simply average those channels to reduce

00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:52,079
noise and increase sharpness, then deal with each image as a 2D array, mxn.

00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:56,540
As we have a wider spectrum than we want but also know the energy gathered by the spectrum

00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:03,430
we don't want, we can simply subtract one from the other to get the spectrum we do want.

00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:09,870
We can look at this operation as a Boolean on two matrices or unary cookie cutter operation.

00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:15,250
We can do basic subtraction between images to reveal the light energy of specific spectrum.

00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:21,910
If you only take one fact away from this talk, it turns out you can isolate a spectrum beyond

00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,880
what optical filtering will allow, by using math.

00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,000
To get the lowest stripe in this infrared rainbow, we can subtract image B from image

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,850
A, leaving with light energy from the low bucket, and to get the next stripes in the

00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:43,720
infrared rainbow, we subtract image C from image B and we get this midband bucket.

00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,510
We already have the high band bucket in image C, so suddenly, possibly for the first time

00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:54,690
ever, we have a tristimulus model entirely in infrared!

00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,451
Because there's optical filters that weren't perfect, and had a little rolloff, there's

00:09:58,451 --> 00:10:01,950
even going to be enough overlap to have intermediary shades.

00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:06,160
If we just drop these into a tiff image file, like a red, green, and blue channel...

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,520
We've imaged an infrared rainbow!

00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,660
Compared to the visible spectrum rainbow...

00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,870
This rainbow is further out, with narrower bands.

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:23,270
Now, because this is a novel, nameless method, I'm proposing it be named after the three

00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,130
cup game.

00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,730
Thimblerig.

00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:32,500
And using the same technique on a cracker jack-loving taxidermied raccoon, we see the

00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,730
domino mask disappear and the cuddly trash panda has less to hide.

00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:44,100
A pineapple growing in an arboretum becomes a ghostly beautiful thing.

00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:50,860
A rainforest orchid loses all of its attractors for pollinating insects.

00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,190
Thanks.

00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,490
If you want to hear more about this, I would love to answer questions and chat about image

00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,490
technology.

00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,590
I'm Phil Warren.
