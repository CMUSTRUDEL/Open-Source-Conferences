	Presented at !!Con West 2020: http://bangbangcon.com/west

This is a talk about what happens when you turn on a Nintendo Game Boy, see the logo scroll down the screen, and hear the *ba-ding!* sound. Itâ€™s about why it happens, and how we know what happens. It involves a clever and litigious company, trademark law, a microscope, nitric acid, and a very dedicated materials science student.
