What do you do when your year-end bonus is directly related to the testing coverage of your project? Writing more tests, although expected, sounded pretty boring. Instead of that, I focused on writing a (totally useless) tool that deletes all untested branches on your code, therefore giving 100% coverage to your project, and not affecting its (tested) functionality!

In this talk, we’ll learn how to write code that uses AST manipulation to modify other pieces of code, and the problems of implementing this in Python. Also, we’ll discuss how an initially useless side project turned out to be not so useless.
