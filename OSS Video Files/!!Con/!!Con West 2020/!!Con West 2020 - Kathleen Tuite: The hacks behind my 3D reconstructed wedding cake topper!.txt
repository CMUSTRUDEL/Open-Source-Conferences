There is cool technology for capturing your likeness with a depth camera like a Kinect and fusing it into a single model. There are also neat ways of 3D printing those models in a bunch of different materials!

As a computer graphics/vision researcher, I thought it would be pretty straightforward to make a model of myself and my partner as a custom wedding cake topper. But time pressure and unfortunate artifacts meant I ALSO had to do some Javascript sleuthing, decode a proprietary 3D model format, and befriend my local makerspace to get it done!!
