In the 1960s when astronauts flew to the moon, they used cutting-edge technology: read-only memory that highly trained women wove together from hair-thin wires and iron cores. These hardcoded programs, called core rope memory, sat at the intersection of hardware and software, digital and analog. It was so resilient, it survived when Apollo 12 was struck mid-air by lightning and rebooted flawlessly. Come learn about how this hard software was made, who created it, and how it got humankind to the moon!
