In the 1960s when astronauts flew to the moon, they used cutting-edge technology: read-only memory that highly trained women wove together from hair-thin wires and iron cores. These hardcoded programs, called core rope memory, sat at the intersection of hardware and software, digital and analog. It was so resilient, it survived when Apollo 12 was struck mid-air by lightning and rebooted flawlessly. Come learn about how this hard software was made, who created it, and how it got humankind to the moon!

Hi, everyone!

00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,000
Thanks for that kind intro.

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,790
So as Joshua mentioned, I'm gonna talk a little bit about software as hardware.

00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:39,550
And an amazing point in time when you could use that to actually fly to the moon.

00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,739
And a little bit about software and hardware.

00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:45,089
Nowadays, we tend to think about it as a physical distinction.

00:00:45,089 --> 00:00:47,040
Hardware is your computer.

00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,930
It's the parts you can see and touch.

00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,110
Software are the instructions for that hardware.

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,050
And they're stored somewhere in there.

00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,809
But it's not something you tend to really see.

00:00:57,809 --> 00:00:59,769
That wasn't always the case.

00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:04,059
Likewise, software wasn't always as prestigious as it is now.

00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:08,770
It was seen initially as just part of making the hardware.

00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:09,920
You write something to make it go.

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,000
But it wasn't seen as a separate practice.

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,420
One of the many legacies of the Apollo Space Missions was changing that.

00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,250
Margaret Hamilton was the one to coin the term "software engineering" and a lot of software

00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,850
engineering practices were formalized at that time.

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:33,270
It was much more recognized as a hard thing to do and something that needs a lot of thought.

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,420
You may be familiar with the picture on the left.

00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,910
This is Margaret Hamilton with a printout of code for the Apollo 11 mission.

00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,390
There might be another mission in there a little bit somewhere.

00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:49,680
And on the right is a woman demonstrating what that code turned into.

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,829
Computers can't read telephone books sort of code.

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:58,579
So they had to use a different form, and on the right is the module holding that software,

00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:04,189
the core rope memory module, which I'll talk about a little more in a bit.

00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:05,880
Well, right now, actually.

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,039
So there are two types of memory used in the Apollo program.

00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:14,950
There's core memory, which is fascinating and I won't talk about much.

00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:20,480
This is erasable memory, so they can read and write to this memory on the left.

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,200
On the right is core rope memory, and this memory was read-only.

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,200
It's made out of these hair-thin copper wires and it was threaded through -- or intentionally

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,360
not threaded through -- iron cores.

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,889
And that's the red rings.

00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:40,110
That you see there in the middle.

00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:45,000
So the way this core rope memory worked: The wires would either go through the core and

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,930
the computer would read that as a 1, or it would go around the core and the computer

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:49,940
would read that as a 0.

00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,870
And then there were also wires that went through the cores to help the computer find the core's

00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,030
location.

00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,030
So as the computer was going to each core to read the software, it would check to see

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,910
if there was a zero or a one.

00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,250
And if you look...

00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,440
I'm gonna use this laser pointer...

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,440
Okay.

00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
Great.

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,479
So on the right, these are all zeroes.

00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:11,069
Because they're not going through a core.

00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:19,590
And then in the middle here, these are either ones or wires to help find the core.

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,941
The other amazing thing about core rope memory was that it was all hand woven, and it was

00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:26,770
all hand woven by women.

00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:32,090
They worked for the Raytheon Company in Waltham, Massachusetts, and a lot of them were former

00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,470
watch makers for the Waltham Watch Co and some of them were said to be seamstresses

00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,590
as well.

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,290
You may be wondering: Could handmade memory be any good?

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,739
The answer is...

00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,780
It was very good.

00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:55,489
The design was excellent in that the distinction between a 0 and 1 was physical.

00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:58,980
Which means it was pretty hard to destroy.

00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,090
During the Apollo 12 mission, a shuttle was actually struck by lightning during launch

00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,460
and they had to reboot the computer.

00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,790
All the information in the erasable memory was lost, but the software...

00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:15,269
Was still intact, so they were able to pick up without any issues, which undoubtedly saved

00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:18,570
a lot of astronauts' lives.

00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:24,139
In terms of the execution of actual weaving itself, that was also excellent.

00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,270
We don't have a lot of firsthand accounts of what it was like to actually weave this

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:33,759
memory, but managers of the core rope memory weavers had nothing but praise for their work.

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,040
They talked about how seriously they took their work, the direct connection between

00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,610
the astronauts' lives, bringing them home safely, and the care they took weaving the

00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,289
memory.

00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:51,530
This was also proven in the mid-60s when Raytheon had a strike, workers weren't making core

00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:56,300
rope memory, but the managers wanted to keep the project on track so they tried their hand

00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,330
at making core rope memory.

00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,729
It was all scrap.

00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:02,629
They couldn't use any of it.

00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:07,650
They didn't have the expertise and care and skill that these women had acquired.

00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:15,500
There are some other reasons why I'm really excited and fascinated about core rope memory.

00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:21,250
It's very unique in time, and I think kind of sits at the confluence of a lot of technological

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,720
and social forces in the United States.

00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,259
It was a bridge between vacuum tube computers and integrated computer chips that we're more

00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:32,370
familiar with today, which are really cool.

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,909
It was really only used on the Apollo space missions because it was so expensive and time

00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:42,879
intensive to make and was pretty quickly replaced with computer chips.

00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,810
The other aspect of it that is pretty cool is that it was...

00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:52,280
It's one of the few times that electronics were manufactured in the same place that they

00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,379
were actually designed.

00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:58,610
The software was written at MIT, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and transported 12 miles to

00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:07,199
Waltham, and hard coded there, so it was a really cool cottage industry of advanced electronics.

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:16,250
Likewise, coming at the end of watchmaking and clothing manufacturing is pretty cool,

00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,840
because imagine working on watches and then working on space shuttles.

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:25,120
It's kind of this amazing transition between old school industrial practices and advanced

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,449
space technology.

00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:36,300
So if you're as excited about core rope memory as I am, I put together now a HOWTO guide.

00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:43,189
Step one, load the component with magnetic iron cores.

00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:47,979
Step two, weave the software into the component.

00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:51,710
They used hollow needles, filled with about 20 feet of copper wire.

00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,270
Embedded that through the cores.

00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:56,039
Based on what the software required.

00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:59,509
And these two women are working together.

00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:03,310
But I've seen a lot of footage and photos of women working solo as well with just this

00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,490
machine.

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,569
And the only part of this process that they really managed to automate is moving the machine

00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:12,630
to the next correct core to weave.

00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,770
And also, this machine that helped kind of push the wire around those nylon pins.

00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,830
The white pins there.

00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,050
To keep it neat and tidy.

00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,770
But that was it, as far as automation.

00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:29,159
Once you thread the needle through, the core will move you to the next spot.

00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:35,789
And finally, to finish the module, you solder the wire in place.

00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,009
Once you finish weaving.

00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:38,970
Remove the nylon pins.

00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,800
Press it down to flatten the wires.

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,039
And then fold those wires into the module itself.

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:51,360
As you can see, it's a pretty tactile experience, actually making this hardware.

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,870
Give it a good final pat.

00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:02,600
And then finally, run electrical testing -- they used another version of this software on paper

00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:09,960
tape to run electrical tests, make sure it was working as expected, and pot the module.

00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:17,300
Potting is a term I like due to the domestic food preservation connotations it has.

00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,750
But basically covered the module in plastic to protect it from the elements and protect

00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,810
it during launch.

00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:31,729
One aspect of this research project that hasn't been as exciting is that there aren't any

00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:37,000
direct references or direct quotes, really, or recordings of these women's experiences

00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,450
of what it's like to make core rope memory.

00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:44,180
I would love to talk to them, especially because I'm currently based in the Boston area.

00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:49,880
If anyone has thoughts on how to get in touch with people who wove core rope memory or their

00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,880
family members, if they talked about what that experience was like, I would love to

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,470
preserve their memories as well.

00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,100
These are names that I've managed to find so far.

00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,100
So yeah.

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,270
Get in touch if you have any thoughts on that.

00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:08,710
Likewise, thinking about what these women's experiences were like, and not really having

00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:14,440
any insight into that, has made me think about what it's like for workers in electronics

00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,820
manufacturing today.

00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,990
There isn't a lot of transparency in their working conditions.

00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,380
In a lot of ways, it feels like a step backwards.

00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,340
And they don't have much of a voice either.

00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,340
So yeah.

00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,000
Something to think about, in terms of how American companies continue to manufacture

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
electronics.

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,030
And the status they give their workers.

00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,060
So that's my talk.

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,070
Thanks for listening.

00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:41,180
