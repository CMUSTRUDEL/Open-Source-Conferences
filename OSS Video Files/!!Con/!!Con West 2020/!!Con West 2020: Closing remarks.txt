Title: !!Con West 2020: Closing remarks
Publication date: 2020-03-23
Playlist: !!Con West 2020
Description: 
	Why is !!Con such a special place?  There's a feeling of transition when we go from the !!Con world back to the tech world at large; Joshua explores the feeling of that, and the question of how we can take some of that feeling back with us into the world at large.

Do I have a microphone?

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,260
I do.

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,260
All right.

00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,500
Always bad news when you give me a microphone.

00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,700
No, I'm kidding.

00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,680
Thanks for coming.

00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,460
I have some prepared remarks.

00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,660
But the worst case scenario is that I'm gonna ad lib, and that's about what's gonna happen.

00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:44,320
I don't know.

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,520
I feel like there's been this theme today of empowerment.

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,820
So we started off with Erin's talk.

00:00:52,820 --> 00:01:02,320
In which she told us about the kind of consequence of disempowerment, of not being able to control

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,100
your computing environment, and what happens when people are no longer -- when people -- this

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,670
keeps resonating in my head.

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,140
Canvas is something that you're not allowed to control.

00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,720
And as a result, Canvas controls you, right?

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,900
Canvas is used to take power away from people who are organizing on this campus.

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:31,920
Later, Kate told us about casual creators and empowering casual creators, and what does

00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:37,800
it do to take away -- there's a word that Kate used, and it's transmogrified in my head

00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,380
to...

00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,380
Disgust!

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,520
I was gonna say shame.

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,260
But disgust.

00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:49,790
And so right now, Lee provides this bookend at the end of today to tell us: Here are 12

00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:55,040
concrete steps, here is a, here is something that I had never heard of, and applying these

00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:02,560
directly to kind of the model of how we operate, the model of things that we can do in the

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,810
computing realm -- so I'm just delighted by that.

00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,200
So I wanted to share my delight with you.

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,530
So that's my ad lib.

00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:14,670
Here's my prepared remarks.

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:21,230
The closing of !!Con is this kind of emotional moment for me.

00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,400
It's been -- putting together a conference is a lot of work.

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,420
It's this... it's kind of this moment of taking a breath.

00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,470
And that's kind of...

00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,170
That's nice also.

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:36,430
But it's also this closing, this feeling of !!Con.

00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:42,100
So I'm gonna bring out this quote again, that Lindsey had earlier, from Rachel Carson.

00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,360
"I should ask that her gift to each child in the world be a sense of wonder so indestructible

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:53,240
that it would last throughout life as an unfailing antidote against the boredom and enchantment

00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:58,940
of later years, the sterile preoccupation with the things that are artificial, the alienation

00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,870
from the sources of our strength.

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,120
That's the Gift of Wonder."

00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:11,260
I wrote in my blog -- which you are not expected to read my blog -- I wrote in my blog a few

00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,010
months ago about the !!Con feeling.

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:20,260
And at the end of !!Con West last year, I spoke a little bit about how we create this space together.

00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,740
And...

00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,360
So here I am, like a little bit nervous, to bring this here.

00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,400
Because what I wrote there is like to a little tiny audience.

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,670
And now I have all of you.

00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,920
So this is kind of like a personal...

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,720
Do I take the moment here to bring in, like, my religious and ethnic background and all

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,720
that kind of sort of stuff?

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
I'm gonna do it.

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,120
Because that's what we do here.

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,700
I'm glad...

00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,040
And I've kind of been hearing side conversations all over...

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,870
Of people who have brought more than just their technical background to !!Con.

00:03:53,870 --> 00:04:00,230
So I have this kind of story, and there's this -- in the Jewish tradition, there's this

00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,400
idea of...

00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,489
So on Friday night, through Saturday, that's the rest day.

00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:08,080
The Sabbath, Shabbat, whatever you want to call it.

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,160
And there's this concept of the Shabbat spice.

00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:18,180
On Shabbat, you make -- or in my family's case -- you buy challah.

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,709
It's a specific bread.

00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,380
And you can make that any day of the week, right?

00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,380
It's not...

00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,389
I mean, it is a pain to make.

00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:26,940
That's why I don't make it.

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,650
But you could make it any day of the week.

00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,740
But it tastes better on Friday night.

00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,500
And you can get it any day of the week, right?

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,140
But it tastes better on Friday night, after you've turned out the lights.

00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,580
And why is that?

00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,310
And so the mythos is that there's this special ingredient called the Shabbat spice.

00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,210
There's this special ingredient called the Shabbat spice.

00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:56,830
And so this ingredient -- I'm gonna quote Lindsey again, who said earlier that, "It's

00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,130
not frivolous for us to be here talking about joy and excitement.

00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,470
It's essential."

00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,190
And it's not frivolous to take the day of rest, right?

00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,190
It's essential.

00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,680
It's not frivolous to have !!Con.

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,680
It's important that we have !!Con.

00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,980
So right.

00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:20,000
And even I will say that even relatively non-observant Jews like myself will periodically get a whiff

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,900
of the Shabbat spice on Friday.

00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,500
So !!Con to me has that feeling.

00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,290
It's this kind of special...

00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,470
This special moment that comes around once a year.

00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:37,300
And so the closing of !!Con West mirrors, in my mind anyway, mirrors the closing, the

00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,250
end of that last day of...

00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,500
That last hour of the day of rest.

00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:49,520
And there's this ceremony, havdalah, where you kind of sing and you chant, and it's halfway

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,160
between mourning that like...

00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,050
Now we are going to go back to our normal day...

00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,120
But also it's this moment of hope.

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,130
That we get to take that...

00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,340
Kind of that special feeling, and bring it back with us.

00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,040
And there's this weird thing.

00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:12,720
A lot of Judaism is not Messianic, like the savior kind of thing.

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,840
Havdalah weirdly is, and like everytime, like last week, I went back and the world was still kind of gross outside.

00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,500
And the week before I went back and the world was kind of gross, but this week, when I open

00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:28,360
my door and I turn the lights back on, maybe it will still be Shabbat outside, and maybe

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,920
this year, when I open the door, it will still be !!Con outside.

00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,050
So I don't know.

00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,750
I kind of have that...

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:43,639
It's this kind of very emotional moment for me, the closing of !!Con, as I prepare to

00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,810
open the door and see what's outside.

00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,229
So it's kind of just like...

00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:49,060
This last moment is a moment to savor it.

00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,600
Anyway, that's my thing.

00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,990
So here's my list of thank yous.

00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,090
A thank you to you, our audience.

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,710
Give yourself a round of applause.

00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,460
(applause)

00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,480
Many of you are here for the first time.

00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,920
And that's great. Welcome.

00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,260
Thank you. Thank you for coming to !!Con.

00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,520
I hope you enjoy this.

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,400
I hope you take this outside in the world with you.

00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,820
Some of you are back at !!Con West for the second time.

00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,760
And that's exciting.

00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,770
Lindsey brought this up earlier.

00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,100
We were talking about this earlier.

00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,880
And that's exciting, because now we're starting to build a community here together of people

00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:30,050
who, like, come back for this again!

00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,259
So that's great.

00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,920
I wanted to thank !!Con's past, who set the stage for this.

00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,060
And !!Con's future.

00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:44,880
And so that's my opportunity to tell you that the call for proposals for !!Con 2020 closes

00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,760
tonight, anywhere on earth time?

00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,760
Is that correct?

00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,400
Did I get that right?

00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,460
Unless...

00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,200
So that's the case. Okay.

00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,620
I have sponsors to thank.

00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,620
There are sponsors.

00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:04,419
Our phenomenal sponsors, UC Santa Cruz, Baskin School of Engineering, and the computer science

00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:06,410
and engineering department.

00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,990
They provided this venue in kind.

00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:12,900
They gave us a bunch of money, with which we bought all sorts of...

00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,669
Like the custodial services, things like that.

00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:16,940
They gave us a bunch of money.

00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,860
And there's a whole bunch of folks in those departments who put in -- I'm gonna hold applause

00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,020
for sponsors all until the end, by the way.

00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,539
There's a whole bunch of folks in those few departments that helped us out.

00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:36,269
LightStep, so they brought three incredible people, and I'm so glad that LightStep joined us.

00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,310
Not only did they come in at a phenomenal sponsorship.

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:47,519
They sponsored the delicious falafel lunch yesterday, they've sponsored captioning.

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,519
And let's see...

00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:54,100
And so the question is: One question I had is who and what is LightStep and why do you need them?

00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:01,160
And the answer is observability if you run cloud services and you have felt the pain of grepping logs.

00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,350
Which I have.

00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,310
Because I'm a hardware engineer, but I still run cloud services.

00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:12,060
If you've felt the pain of grepping logs, then you should talk to LightStep.

00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,860
So those are our phenomenal sponsors.

00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,240
Let's have a round of applause for our phenomenal sponsors.

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,380
(applause)

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,540
This year we had an excellent sponsor.

00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,279
Twilio came in at the excellent sponsorship level.

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,569
And I want to say that actually for one of my clients, I use Twilio, and their sales

00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:36,339
organization is really, really good, and their product is really, really good.

00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:41,550
So if you have cause to put a SIM card in something and program the SIM card, you should

00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:46,939
talk to Twilio, and on the other end, if you want to answer somebody's telephone call or

00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:50,019
answer somebody's SMS, then you should also talk to Twilio.

00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:51,990
So those are why you should talk to Twilio.

00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,760
Let's give them a round of applause.

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,620
(applause)

00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,579
We came in with four awesome sponsors this year.

00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:04,529
Recurse Center -- we love Recurse Center.

00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:13,649
Okay, Recurse Center. If you want to go take a break from your job and spend six weeks learning to do

00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:19,180
something, self-directed if you want. If you want !!Con for six weeks, you should go talk to Recurse Center

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,730
So Recurse Center are great.

00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,220
And by the way, they sponsored -- if you're watching on the live stream, or if you're

00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,130
watching a recorded version of this, Recurse Center sponsored that.

00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,340
We had Mapbox.

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,500
So they do -- as the name might suggest -- they do custom integrated maps.

00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:42,230
And if you use Strava, which I do, I'm kind of like a cyclist nerd, all of their new map

00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:47,700
tiles and special maps that have elevation and all that kind of stuff -- that's Mapbox.

00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,300
Another sponsor is Accelerated Tech, which is this weird two-person consultancy.

00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,180
That's me.

00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,860
Building hardware and software solutions, and also come work with me.

00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,779
So if you really like that kind of thing. Hi.

00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:04,819
Come talk to me.

00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:05,819
Heap!

00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:07,600
So they're doing web product analytics.

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,829
So if you want to know where people are clicking on your website, and why they are or are not

00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:17,959
converting to click the "Buy" button on your website, you should talk to Heap Analytics.

00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:19,350
So those are our four awesome sponsors.

00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,060
Can I have a round of applause for them?

00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,560
(applause)

00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,300
Okay.

00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,619
I have a supporting team.

00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:33,089
From UCSC, we had Ady Weinstein and Melissa Baker, who helped us put together, who helped

00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:36,379
us like actually order the food, which is good.

00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:41,860
Juan Perez and Phil Johnston from Learning Technologies helped us, and in particular I want to thank Juan

00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,500
who came in here at 8 am Saturday morning to help us get all that set up.

00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,720
I think that's super incredible.

00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:56,120
The University catering team. They were responsible for the snacks and breakfasts and coffee.

00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,420
And the grounds and custodial staff, who were supervised by Eva Banuelos.

00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,480
The transportation staff for shuttle buses.

00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,660
I don't know if you took the shuttle buses this year.

00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:14,560
If you did, I can't express my gratitude enough for them getting all that set up.

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,119
In the back there, Cindy Backman and Demi Smith have been recording, and have been recording

00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:24,230
all of the slides, and have done all of this effort to get the live stream up and running.

00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,499
They are the Confreaks team.

00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:32,549
And White Coat Captioning, Mirabai Knight is over on that screen typing right now.

00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:35,480
Can I have a round of applause for all of the above?

00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:41,980
(applause)

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,899
I have a bunch of speakers.

00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,060
So there are too many speakers.

00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,709
I cannot list the name of every speaker.

00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:51,720
I do want to give shoutouts especially to Kate Compton.

00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,759
We had three speakers who bailed at the last moment.

00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:55,759
Like...

00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,800
Literally Thursday night, we had two speakers who had a health emergency and another speaker

00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,079
who had another personal emergency.

00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:08,290
So Kate came in here and gave this incredible keynote on two days of notice.

00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:12,980
And I just can't express my gratitude enough for Kate Compton. And all the speakers.

00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:17,060
(applause)

00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,779
And finally, so I think that's all that I have.

00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:31,060
The organizers for this weekend, Dema Abu Adas, Dev Purandare, Gargi Sharma is somewhere...

00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:36,989
in the back there, along with Jeena Lee, Lindsey Kuper, Varun Gandhi, and I am Joshua Wise.

00:13:36,989 --> 00:13:38,779
The shuttle is at 4:40 PM.

00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:39,910
Thank you very much. Good night.

00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:40,560
Get home safe.

00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:47,140
