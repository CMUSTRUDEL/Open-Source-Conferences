Hello!

00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,760
Good morning, everyone!

00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:33,220
How are you doing?

00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,220
(applause)

00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,220
Good!

00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,220
Cool!

00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,220
Awesome!

00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,780
We have one more day of exciting talks.

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,850
And I'll do some housekeeping, some announcements, so first of all, I would like to thank our

00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:47,850
sponsors.

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,840
Without them, this wouldn't be possible.

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,089
We're very, very grateful for the generous support.

00:00:55,089 --> 00:01:00,629
Second, if you can, you should donate to the UCSC Strike Fund.

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:08,540
Maggie has put up a sign outside where she'll be matching donations up to $500, and there

00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:13,740
are details of how you can help contribute.

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,119
The other thing is: We have a code of conduct.

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,740
You can read it on our website.

00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,680
And if...

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,640
You can either send us an SMS on a number that will be displayed here during the breaks,

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,520
or you can flag one of us in a yellow T-shirt and talk to us.

00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:42,999
There's a Google form online, where you can send in anonymous complaints, if you have

00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:43,999
them.

00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:47,710
The other thing is that we have a quiet room.

00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:51,600
The quiet room is across the courtyard.

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,229
And if you can't find it, or don't know where it is, you can again flag one of us in yellow

00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:00,130
T-shirts, and we'll show you the way.

00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,170
The other thing is bathrooms.

00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:06,060
We have two right outside the auditorium.

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,340
They're all-gender restrooms.

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,360
And we have men's and women's restrooms.

00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,290
One on the left, in the left building, and one across the courtyard, again.

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,740
And if you can't find them, we can again help you.

00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:30,120
And I want to invite Maggie to talk about Exclamation Foundation for a few minutes.

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,250
Woo!

00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,390
Maggie!

00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,650
Thank you.

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,790
Okay.

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,740
Everybody take up your thingy.

00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,620
You don't have to take it off.

00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,245
I'm just taking it off because it was in my way.

00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:44,360
Turn it over so your name is not facing you.

00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,939
So you may see -- and you probably saw this already -- it says !!Con West 2020 was brought

00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:51,620
to you by Exclamation Foundation.

00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,829
So what is the Exclamation Foundation?

00:02:55,829 --> 00:03:01,660
This past year, we finally incorporated a holding body.

00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:08,989
!!Con and !!Con West for a while were run out of one of the original organizerâ€™s LLC,

00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:12,560
which was named Bang Bang Corn, if you've seen that name around.

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,690
Perhaps you're a sponsor and have seen an invoice from Bang Bang Corn and wondered...

00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,160
I wonder what that is?

00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,629
So now we have an actual holding body.

00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:27,630
If you're interested in the details, I'll share one sentence with you.

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:31,599
We're a non-tax exempt non-profit.

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,560
So what that means is we have a board.

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,980
Lindsey is our president.

00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,709
I'm currently treasurer.

00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:43,230
Julia, who I think is somewhere, is secretary.

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:49,200
And we have bylaws that we abide by, and there's no equity or ownership structure.

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,450
So we're not a 501c3.

00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:54,560
We have thoughts about maybe doing that in the future, so that we can apply for grants

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,790
and accept personal donations that are tax exempt for individuals.

00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,790
So...

00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,790
Those are the details.

00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,730
If you are curious about more, and if you're curious about what we're gonna do with this,

00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:10,290
and what it means for the future of !!Con and !!Con West, we're curious too.

00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,969
And we're figuring it out.

00:04:11,969 --> 00:04:14,459
If you have ideas that you want to share, I'm happy to hear them.

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:15,629
Lindsey is happy to hear them.

00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:17,500
I'm sure Julia is happy to hear them as well.

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,099
So come find us and talk to us at one of the breaks.

00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:22,690
(inaudible)

00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:28,020
Oh, Lindsey just asked: How do you email the board of the Exclamation Foundation?

00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:34,080
I believe you can email us at board@exclamation.foundation.

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,700
And we will get that email.

00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:42,670
If you go to the website, exclamation.foundation, you will also see a mailing address, which

00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:47,020
will also come to our email.

00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,920
Because it's 2020.

00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
(laughter)

00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,810
Thank you!

00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,710
Thank you, Maggie!

00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,710
Okay.

00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:01,020
So I want to introduce our first speaker for today.

00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,670
Erin is a digital scholarship librarian.

00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:11,590
Her work focuses on digital tools and practices to make education and knowledge production

00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:17,170
more democratic, collaborative, and publicly engaging.

00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,330
And she is going to be giving our keynote today.

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:25,810
So please join me in welcoming Erin for our first keynote today!

00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,100
