Publication date: 2020-03-23
Playlist: !!Con West 2020
Description: 
	Why are we having this conference?  And especially in these particularly dark days, why are we having a conference at all?  Some words about our code of conduct, and some words from Sohum Banerjea, who is a graduate student worker who was fired from UC Santa Cruz just a few hours before we started setup on Friday -- and, finally some answers as to why we find !!Con so important.
