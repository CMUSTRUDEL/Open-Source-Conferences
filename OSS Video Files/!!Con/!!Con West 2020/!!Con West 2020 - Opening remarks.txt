Publication date: 2020-03-23
Playlist: !!Con West 2020
Description: 
	Why are we having this conference?  And especially in these particularly dark days, why are we having a conference at all?  Some words about our code of conduct, and some words from Sohum Banerjea, who is a graduate student worker who was fired from UC Santa Cruz just a few hours before we started setup on Friday -- and, finally some answers as to why we find !!Con so important.

Hi, everyone!

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,400
Welcome to !!Con West 2020!

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,640
(applause)

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,670
I apologize for the slightly late start.

00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,690
My name is Lindsey Kuper.

00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,930
I’m Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering here in the Computer Science

00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,460
and Engineering department at the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz.

00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:51,540
I want to give a particular welcome to to everyone who is at a !!Con for the first time.

00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,870
So, if you're here for the first time, can I see a show of hands?

00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:57,940
That's amazing.

00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,140
Let's give a round of applause.

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,140
(applause)

00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,039
I won't ask you to show your hands, but a lot of people are also here at their first

00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:07,039
conference ever!

00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:08,039
So if we could get a round of applause for those people as well...

00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:13,280
(applause)

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,409
So I have a few bits of administrivia to share before I hand things off to my fellow organizer,

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:22,719
Joshua, who is going to talk about our code of conduct.

00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,600
First of all, the restrooms.

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,850
There are two all gender restrooms in the back of the auditorium.

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:35,540
Both of them have some baskets with pads and tampons on them.

00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:41,710
There are men's and women's restrooms in the building across the courtyard that way, and

00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,850
another all gender restroom in the basement of the building next door.

00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:52,899
So if there's a line, you can always go across the courtyard and next door.

00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:58,590
I was asked to mention that along the left side of the sections in all three sections,

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,219
there are left-handed desks!

00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:04,320
So if you need a left-handed desk, you can sit on the left side of a section.

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,600
We have a lost and found.

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,130
It's this box right here.

00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,120
If you've lost anything, look there.

00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,670
We do not want you to get the conference plague.

00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,940
It's a pretty common affliction of people who attend conferences, so I've broken this

00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,780
rule myself already a few times today, but we would like to encourage people to...

00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:32,030
Instead of shaking hands, just wave enthusiastically.

00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:38,030
All right.

00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,640
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Joshua to talk about our code of conduct.

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,290
(applause)

00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,590
>> Hi there!

00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,900
Good morning!

00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,600
I was trying to put together...

00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,040
Can you hear that?

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,040
Excellent.

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,590
I was trying to put together thoughts about a code of conduct and the big question that

00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:05,150
I want to answer is: Why have a code of conduct?

00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,760
It's a common thing to put a code of conduct on your website to say you have a code of

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,820
conduct.

00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,950
That's not why we want to have a code of conduct.

00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,590
It’s not because we have to have a code of conduct, but it's because we intentionally

00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,900
want to set how !!Con feels.

00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:26,580
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret about !!Con.

00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,770
So this is a conference, if you're not aware, of 10-minute lightning talks, the joy, excitement,

00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,980
and surprise of programming.

00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,890
If you weren’t aware.

00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,510
Hi, welcome!

00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,420
But that's only a little bit of it.

00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:45,850
The other side is that it's also about bringing that kind of joy, excitement, and surprise

00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:54,400
to faces who don't usually get to be in the room.

00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:01,600
I'm gonna mangle a quote from Dr. King and say that this is a natural follow-on.

00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,580
Because withholding joy, excitement, and surprise from anyone is a threat to joy, excitement,

00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,880
and surprise for everyone.

00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,880
Right?

00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,850
We can’t have it without getting everyone in the room.

00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:16,000
So I’m going to let you in on a second secret about !!Con, because the first secret is not

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,889
a very good secret.

00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:22,729
The second secret is that !!Con is not about diversity and inclusion.

00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:26,190
I actually don’t like either of those, and here’s why.

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:31,330
Diverse to me means that I want to bring a token one of you into the room because you

00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:37,590
can benefit me, because diverse ideas are better and you can take your diverse ideas

00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,590
and give them to me.

00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,479
I don't like that.

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,610
Inclusive means, this space belongs to me, but I’m going to let you be here.

00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,990
Include you into my space.

00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,039
And I don't like that either.

00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:55,050
So The code of conduct is here because I would like to have an equitable and representative

00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:06,669
space, where everybody gets to stand on the same level and see the same things rather

00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:13,909
than for any benefit to me, and I would like to see not just a token one or two people

00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:21,419
of this or that, but a space that represents the gamut of humanity.

00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:25,659
That's my other second little secret about !!Con.

00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:33,400
No matter what section of humanity you come from, I want to welcome you here.

00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
So.

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
The code of conduct bit.

00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,599
It's on our website.

00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:39,629
The short form is: Be kind to your fellow attendees.

00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:43,729
Make everyone feel like they're welcome here.

00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:46,210
We did a spin on our code of conduct this year.

00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:53,849
We edited it some, in response to -- tweaking it from last year.

00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:56,999
What I've discovered is that there are a lot of ways to be unkind.

00:05:56,999 --> 00:06:01,870
If you do it accidentally, please apologize and if you do it intentionally, this might

00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,629
not be the right place for you.

00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:10,879
Rather than telling you what not to do, I’m just saying: please act in line with our values.

00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,059
Make it a joyful, exciting, and surprising space.

00:06:14,059 --> 00:06:17,699
At the risk of going on too long about that, how can you do that?

00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:21,779
I want to give you three tips.

00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:24,409
Avoid feigning surprise.

00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:28,590
You can take this outside of !!Con too.

00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,590
Like if someone goes...

00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:34,379
I've never heard you can use colon as a token in bash.

00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:39,199
Rather than saying you never heard that you can use colon as a token in bash?

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,919
Rather than doing that, take a moment to revel in the excitement that they’re about to

00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:49,789
learn that you can write a fork bomb in 9 characters in bash.

00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:52,499
So avoid feigning surprise if you can do that.

00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:55,129
Another thing is "well, actually".

00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:56,129
You're about to tell me...

00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:59,370
Actually, I think it's 10 characters that that fork bomb is.

00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,370
Because I didn't count.

00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,569
I just thought of that.

00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:06,520
As it turns out, telling me that adds basically nothing.

00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,930
A fork bomb is short in bash.

00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:09,930
So, don't do that!

00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,520
There's just no need for it.

00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,580
The third one is...

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,629
This is a wide family of things.

00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:17,120
There are subtle -isms.

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,780
It's obvious to say you don't belong here.

00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,979
That's an obvious -ism.

00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:23,500
The subtle one is to say...

00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,900
My grandmother could do this.

00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:33,789
That's subtly excluding the class of folks who are older and women and et cetera, et

00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:34,919
cetera, et cetera.

00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:35,919
Try and avoid that.

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,960
We're not gonna kick you out of the conference if you do it, but be mindful.

00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,879
If someone says you did it, say...

00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,879
Good point.

00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:44,879
Thanks.

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,009
So, if you’re not sure, read our code of conduct, it’s on our web site, it won’t

00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,009
take long.

00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:51,159
We want you to have confidence in our code of conduct; we wrote a transparency report

00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,449
last year.

00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:53,949
It's interesting reading.

00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:56,520
Keep us honest.

00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,349
If you run into trouble, find someone wearing one of these yellow shirts or click the form

00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:07,159
link at the bottom of the code of conduct, or our friends at Twilio set up an SMS gateway.

00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:21,470
If you want to talk to us or any of those things: 831-713-2605.

00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:25,139
And so I'm tempted to say: Now that I'm done talking about things that are a bummer, I'm

00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:27,139
gonna talk about things that are also a bummer.

00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,840
But the code of conduct is actually not a bummer.

00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:34,690
I'm excited about it because it makes !!Con special.

00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,039
You've probably heard there's a strike on campus.

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,459
There are graduate student workers who are fighting for a living wage.

00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:45,910
It is a bummer that they have to fight.

00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:51,340
But I am proud to introduce Sohum Banerjea to talk about that.

00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,870
Welcome, Sohum.

00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,640
>> Hello.

00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,410
Whoa.

00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,170
Okay.

00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,709
Hi, everybody.

00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:09,370
I'm Sohum Banerjea, a PhD student at the CSE department.

00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,970
I work in programming languages.

00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:19,670
And as of yesterday, the University of California, Santa Cruz, fired me from all further ASE

00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:25,399
appointments, for striking for a living wage.

00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:29,480
As an international student, this carries with it an abnegation of the university's

00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:35,540
promise to support us over the course of our studies, and the threat of effective deportation.

00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,690
We are not allowed to stay in the country unless we maintain student status; we can't

00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:43,410
maintain student status without paying tuition, and can't pay tuition without tuition remission.

00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,170
You see the course of logic.

00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,150
But this should not be surprising, because this is only the latest reification in the

00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:54,480
forces that pushed us to strike in the first place.

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,970
So what is the COLA campaign?

00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,180
The demand is extremely simple.

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,930
Pay us enough to live here.

00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:10,160
Our graduate funding packages promise us $19,000 a year to live, work, and research in this

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,310
city.

00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:20,220
How much it costs to to live in Santa Cruz as a single healthy student vary, but they

00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:25,470
start at $25,000, and go up to $31,000 a year.

00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:35,120
To note, the lower end of that number is given by the university in its own official documentation.

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,620
Despite that, the university has repeatedly ignored for years our attempts to go through

00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:46,130
official channels, to bargain, to plead, and to draw attention to the plight facing its

00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,889
graduate student workers.

00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:53,750
Our union pushed through a controversial contract in 2018 that we at Santa Cruz overwhelmingly

00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:00,800
voted against, so we finally felt forced to take direct action and to hell with the no

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,040
strikes clause.

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,320
(applause)

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,010
And so here we are.

00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:19,949
Months of stone walling and millions of dollars spent on police brutality later, here we are.

00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:27,110
In having this response, in deciding to fire the graduate student workers whose only request

00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:33,920
was that the university pay us enough to live here, the UC system has shown the lie of its

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,560
diversity marketing.

00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,339
It has shown that it does not care about access to education.

00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:45,329
It shows that voices and faces like mine are only welcome here as long as we stay quiet

00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:48,839
and are willing to be taken advantage of.

00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:53,410
If you live in California, this is what your public university system is doing.

00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,970
If you live in America, this is what your public university system is doing.

00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:03,320
If you live in the world, this is not what your public university system is doing.

00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:09,110
(sigh) And that's awful.

00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,000
Look.

00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,079
I'm not here to bum you out.

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,750
Although I have done a pretty good job of it at this point.

00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,149
What can you do to help?

00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:20,290
There's a lot.

00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,490
Put pressure on public officials and the university system.

00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,509
Donate to the strike fund.

00:12:26,509 --> 00:12:31,930
We've had an outpouring of support in the wake of these firings.

00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:37,560
It's frankly humbling.

00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,110
Tell everyone you know in a position of power or even not in a position of power.

00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,470
Tell everyone you know that this is happening.

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,800
Because we are done staying silent.

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,639
(applause)

00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,970
>> Thank you very much.

00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:05,170
I want to mention that the !!Con organizers are grateful to the strike organizing committee

00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:13,850
for essentially being willing to let us have this conference.

00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:18,579
As many of you know, we spoke with the strike organizing team and they agreed that attending

00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:23,110
this conference this weekend did not constitute crossing the picket line.

00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:27,470
We're grateful to them for being wiling to say that, because, understandably, we had

00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:32,839
a lot of speakers and attendees who were ready to bail.

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:39,880
I'm really grateful that this conference was able to happen, despite the strike.

00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,230
So...

00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,230
On a more positive note...

00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:48,800
!!Con was started by a group of good friends and I in New York in 2014.

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,839
And it started honestly as a joke, and then it became a real conference.

00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:58,560
And then six years later, it's become one of the most important and rewarding aspects

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,560
of my career.

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,580
And it's just my incredible honor and privilege to be able to bring !!Con West now to Santa

00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:11,329
Cruz for the second year in a row.

00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:14,560
(applause)

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:21,519
So I want to say a little bit about why we do !!Con West.

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,839
Computing is popular.

00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:29,611
We encourage young people to “learn to code” so they can get that high paying job, make

00:14:29,611 --> 00:14:35,439
themselves or their country more competitive in the global economy, or maybe help their

00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:37,129
country go to war.

00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:41,089
But none of those things are why I study computer science.

00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:49,710
I study CS because I find the ideas awe inspiring and I find the people awe inspiring.

00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,639
And that is why we do !!Con.

00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:58,079
And it seems relevant here to share a couple of quotations with you from Rachel Carson,

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,399
who had something to say about child-like wonder.

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,800
She said -- and I think this is from her book, The Sense of Wonder -- she wrote a child's

00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,730
world is fresh and new and beautiful.

00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,889
Full of wonder and excitement.

00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:17,189
It is our misfortune that for most of us that clear eyed vision, that true instinct for

00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:23,140
what is beautiful and awe-inspiring is dimmed and even lost before we reach adulthood.

00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:27,069
If I had influence over the good fairy who is supposed to preside over the Christening

00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:32,730
of all children, I would ask that her gift to each child in the world be a sense of wonder

00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:38,220
so indestructable that it would last throughout life, as an unfailing antidote against the

00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:44,989
boredom and disenchantment of later years, the alienation from the sources of our strength.

00:15:44,989 --> 00:15:46,600
And that is what !!Con is about.

00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:52,529
It's about having a sense of wonder and awe about computing and about the people who do

00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:54,060
computing.

00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,670
And there's one last thing to say about that.

00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:01,209
So one might ask...

00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:06,939
Isn't it frivolous of us to be here talking about joy and wonder and eating doughnuts

00:16:06,939 --> 00:16:13,019
while so many bad things are happening in the world, while the world is burning?

00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:16,819
To that, I think the best thing I can say is another Rachel Carson quote.

00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:22,470
She wrote: The more clearly we can focus our attention on the wonders of the universe about

00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:27,069
us, the less taste we will have for the destruction of our race.

00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:31,060
Wonder and humility are wholesome emotions, and they do not exist side by side with the

00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,499
lust for destruction.

00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:37,589
In other words, it is not frivolous for us to be here talking about joy and excitement.

00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:40,480
It is in fact essential.

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,339
That is why we do !!Con.

00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:49,449
(applause)

00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:53,520
So with that, I'm very proud to be able to introduce our first keynote speaker,

00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,360
isis lovecruft.

00:16:55,379 --> 00:17:00,899
isis is a cryptographer who has contributed to Signal, the Tor Project, the Electronic

00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:03,279
Frontier Foundation, and many others.

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:09,100
They enjoy making fast, safe, and hard-to-misuse cryptographic libraries in Rust, walking through

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:14,179
the woods with their wolfhound familiar and casting curses on evil doers in tech to turn

00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:17,659
them into umbrellas.

00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:20,410
