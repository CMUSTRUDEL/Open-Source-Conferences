Sometimes you want to find out some information about a neural net in PyTorch while it runs. Like what if you wanted to do some math of your own on the math that happens inside the network? You can do that with hooks! Hooks can go on each module of a neural network to spy on the black box and whisper its secrets to you. No neural net will keep its secrets hidden from your perceptive functions.
