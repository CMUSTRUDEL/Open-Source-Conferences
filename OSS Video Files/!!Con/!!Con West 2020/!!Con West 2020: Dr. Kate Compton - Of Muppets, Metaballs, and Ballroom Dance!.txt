And I'm your emergency speaker for today.

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,180
They asked me to give this talk on Thursday.

00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:39,000
I have not practiced this, but it does have a lot of animated JIFES in it.

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,110
So prepare yourself.

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,110
JIFES is the RC Cola of GIF pronunciation.

00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,610
It angers everyone.

00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:55,140
So a little about me, I'm galaxykate, recently graduated from UC Santa Cruz, I'm now Dr.

00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,050
Galaxy Kate.

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,220
Iâ€™m probably best known for creating the language called Tracery which powers the website

00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:07,370
called cheapbotsdonequick so I'm the proud grandmother of 10,000 Twitter bots that we

00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:12,630
know of, including Infinite Scream, the greatest ever Twitter bot.

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:20,210
So my mission statement is: I bring AI to people that AI doesn't deserve.

00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,960
AI is a little bit of a trash fire.

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,520
And I don't want to just bring poets to it, so they too can live in the trash fire.

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,590
But to take the tools from AI and bring them out to other people.

00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:38,540
And so I'm currently being generously funded by the Center for Research in Open Source

00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,540
Software.

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,390
I also brought a bunch of swag.

00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,640
As part of my mission to bring cool tools to poets.

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,380
If anybody has made bots, however you define them, I have merit badges, if you think you've

00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:56,120
earned a bot merit badge, and I have lots of zines.

00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,860
I also make an absolute ton of weird prototypes.

00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,850
I almost never finish anything because there's always new shiny stuff to be made.

00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,140
Yeah.

00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,060
Just lots and lots of prototypes.

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,910
But my research over the last eight years...

00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,450
So I wrote this dissertation on something called casual creators, which I'll tell you

00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,620
more about in a moment.

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,980
This is software used for creativity, but not in the way that Photoshop or Garage Band

00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,819
is about creativity.

00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:27,940
Those are things that are getting you to a product.

00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,120
Your boss wants this thing.

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,780
Your brain wants this opera.

00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,720
They're all about the product.

00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,970
It turns out there is this whole other weird class of software.

00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,410
And I played Kid Pix back in the day.

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:46,060
This guy wrote a lovely essay about what it means to have built it and why he built it

00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,710
the way it did.

00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:52,370
He says: The process of making a picture should be as important as the picture produced.

00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:57,400
If you're working for Pixar, this is not a thing to tell your boss.

00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,810
They don't care about the process or how you feel when you're making it.

00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,709
They care about the product.

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:06,760
But this is a whole class of software that I think is really interesting, because it

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,290
is about the process.

00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,880
So like I needed a term for this.

00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,870
I called them casual creators.

00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:23,680
These are everything from Burger King's Simpson-ify yourself, weird doodly make a cake pop apps

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,590
any of the things where you doodle on your phone, it multiplies your effort in interesting

00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:34,069
ways, things where you can doodle music or sound, even things like K'Nex where you're

00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:37,610
not so much about making the thing, but the physical pleasure about snapping things together,

00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,630
Rainbow Loom, if any of you are of that generation.

00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,959
But this took me forever when I was writing this.

00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,940
I had to go through the process of: What is creativity?

00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:55,709
We often say people are creative, like Mozart or Steve Jobs.

00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:58,020
In my research, this seems to not be true.

00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,880
There's not a class of creative and uncreative people.

00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,780
As far as we can tell, everyone is creative.

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,630
However, has everyone seen the movie Inside Out?

00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,770
The Pixar movie?

00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:13,090
And at one point, she develops this new superpower of disgust?

00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:18,840
There is in fact a moment in your childhood from about the age of 6 to 12, where you discover

00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,840
disgust.

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,840
And it goes from physical disgust of...

00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,090
I don't like broccoli...

00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:25,910
To social disgust of I don't like this person or this activity.

00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,930
And you see other people being disgusted by you.

00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,970
And so if you ask a group of 6-year-olds...

00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:33,970
Can you paint?

00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:34,970
Can you draw?

00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:35,970
Can you dance?

00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:36,970
They will all say yes!

00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,910
Because at that moment, they know "can" as the physical act.

00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:43,210
I can move my body, hold a pencil, make my mouth tell a story.

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,660
If you ask 12-year-olds or heaven forfend 35-year-olds, they sit on their hands, because

00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:54,880
"can you" means "can you do so without being disgusting to yourself and the world?"

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,400
And this is actually an issue.

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,790
When you read about creativity and you're not Steve Jobs, you read about people's fear

00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,880
of creativity.

00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,630
And so it's not so much about are you creative, but like, what is currently keeping you from

00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,630
being creative?

00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,580
What is your fear of creativity?

00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,260
I love this.

00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,260
Can I draw?

00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,160
How to tell if you're good enough.

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,540
Not even just good at drawing enough.

00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,540
Are you good enough?

00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,180
Do you have the moral fabric to draw?

00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:25,770
This is Calvinist art education.

00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,970
So a little bit about problems and creativity.

00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,310
These are just a couple of the problems that have been discovered.

00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,410
You can read any of the previous books on the previous slide or anything on Pinterest

00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,230
to see: What are the issues with creativity?

00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,300
Things like being undirected.

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,770
Freezing up.

00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,979
Being trained to come up with the "right" answer.

00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:46,680
Are you good enough for this crowd?

00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
Is this the right answer?

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,680
Is this what you wanted?

00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,419
Being afraid of negative judgments.

00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:54,000
Running out of ideas.

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,770
There's a Winston Churchill...

00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:02,020
After World War II and being probably one of the most powerful men to ever live on this

00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:07,210
earth, retired and started watercolor painting and was very bad at it, and he wrote a book

00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,930
about being bad at watercolor painting.

00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:15,260
And he has this anecdote where he is staring in terror at a blank page and one of his lady

00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,660
friends comes up in a car and throws paint on it, like...

00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,660
Now you can start!

00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,190
And miracle of miracles, it turns out he could.

00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:26,060
This is not something that affects people who are not good enough or creative enough

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,630
or powerful enough.

00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,630
Everybody has this aspect in their life.

00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:34,880
Winston Churchill being a very complicated example.

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,580
But no matter what you can say about Winston Churchill, he was bad at watercolor painting.

00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,490
So I worked on a game called Spore way back in the day, in 2007.

00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,800
And Spore had this real gem of something called a creature creator.

00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,650
Where you could sculpt out a little creature and it would come to life under your hands.

00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:56,490
And we got really wonderful letters, hand written letters from people, saying...

00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,990
This game made me feel creative again.

00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,139
Which was kind of awesome.

00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:05,340
We're getting a lot of hate on the internet, but we would get hand written letters from

00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,490
people who said...

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,820
I thought I wasn't creative anymore, and now I know I was wrong!

00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,600
And this is designed with improv kind of knowledge.

00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,479
Because the guy who designed this was taking high level improv classes at Berkeley while

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,820
he was designing this.

00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,509
So this is just jammed full of every improv principle he could think of.

00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:26,580
There's books like...

00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,949
Impro, which laid out what Improv would later be.

00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,520
So these are things like...

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,259
You give people prompts.

00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:35,979
You give people acknowledgment when they do something.

00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:39,320
Whatever arm or stupid accessory you put on your creature, it will look at it and nine

00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,830
times out of ten, it will go...

00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,830
Yeah!

00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,830
That was really good!

00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,070
And sometimes it'll be like no.

00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,070
It was terrible.

00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,580
Just to give you feedback of...

00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,780
It acknowledged you.

00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,430
It saw you.

00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,539
Yes, and.

00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:54,300
This is the most caricatured bit of improv.

00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,669
This yes, and is like...

00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:57,570
It sees what you did.

00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,669
It internalizes and then it, like, adds something new.

00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:04,770
So now you have something to bounce off too.

00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:05,870
So the questions of...

00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,160
So I'm not gonna go a lot into casual creators in today's talk.

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,630
I would encourage you to read my zine about it, which is outside.

00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,479
Or just ask me about it on Twitter.

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,600
The question is: How do we get people to be creative?

00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,310
How do we get people to move?

00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:22,150
And how do we get people to move creatively?

00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:30,490
This is gonna be about casual creatives for dance or ways to help people move creatively.

00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,930
And then how do we do all this with a computer?

00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,899
So let's do some improv.

00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:40,089
Raise your hand if you've felt a sick feeling in your stomach when I said let's do some

00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:41,089
improv.

00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:42,259
All right.

00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:43,529
So first off...

00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:45,050
Do something.

00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,050
(cheering)

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,339
All right.

00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:48,410
Very good.

00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,290
Say something.

00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,290
Your hand is a puppet.

00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,230
Say hello to your neighbor.

00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:59,080
Name a Pokemon.

00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:05,560
Oh, the year was 1778...

00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,080
Yep.

00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,050
So what did this teach us?

00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:14,610
Aside from the fact that we now know who the Canadians are.

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,580
(laughter)

00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,290
So we like to be right when we're answering.

00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,970
If there's not a right answer, we'll often freeze up.

00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,010
Like...

00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,480
Reflect on when I said "do something" and you thought...

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,010
Is this thing that I'm about to do too big?

00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,010
Is it too small?

00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,010
Am I doing the right thing?

00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,190
What's my neighbor doing?

00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,430
Is my neighbor looking at me?

00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,430
Oh, gosh.

00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:39,560
Prompts are really great for this, because they give us a few possible right answers.

00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,720
Or they'll give us a prompt.

00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,399
If I say your hand is a puppet, there are probably lots of ways your hand could be a

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,330
puppet, but probably the right one is to do this.

00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,820
And I give you a prompt.

00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,820
Say hi to your neighbor.

00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,090
It makes it easy to say hello.

00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:56,060
There are lots of things you could have done with that prompt, but there was an easy right

00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,060
answer.

00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,540
That gives people just really two choices.

00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,620
Go with the easy route or try to add onto the easy route.

00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:08,950
And limiting people to two choices seems like a really strong pattern in this sort of thing.

00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,070
So lessons.

00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,150
Prompts can be verbal.

00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,120
I just gave you verbal prompts.

00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,800
They can also be props.

00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:21,020
I can hand you a shovel on the improv stage and that shovel will tell you what the right

00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:25,610
answer is and what your options are for creative "righter" answers.

00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:34,230
They can be music, things like clapping or dancing to whatever beat is...

00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:43,720
Many of us have personal dancing styles that are just event reaction to beats.

00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,910
They can be clothing.

00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,240
So this is...

00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,450
Things that you should not do to your cat.

00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:52,610
But this is apparently -- this was used in How to Train Your Dragon.

00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:57,480
They put tape on the back of a cat and used it as art reference.

00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,310
When you add things to your body, it makes you move differently.

00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,300
We'll talk about that later.

00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,269
There can also be cultural expectations.

00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:10,980
The 1778 one is -- people have expectations of what you say after that.

00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:18,700
YMCA -- after you're trained into it, you can always dance that dance in the future.

00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:23,170
Different subcultures can have the dance that everybody can do because this is the dance

00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,339
everybody knows how to do.

00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:28,519
It makes people who otherwise feel terrified of dancing know that...

00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:33,050
Yes, I can do the hora, the YMCA, the Electric Slide.

00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:37,440
And you will do it well enough to not be disgusting to those around you.

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,820
And again, this is like...

00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,360
Everyone can dance.

00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,930
We're letting them know that they're allowed to dance.

00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,910
So one thing that I would like to say here is: Clothing is an improv partner.

00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,740
This is one of the biggest things that I found.

00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,529
Everybody knows if you wear a cape that there are a certain number of cape moves that you

00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:54,920
can do.

00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,650
If you ever need to do motion capture and somebody is not moving enough, give them a

00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,650
cape.

00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:03,350
And suddenly they'll move a lot.

00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:08,510
There's a board called the Greatest Movie Capes and there's like 60 different capes

00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,490
in movies that are great.

00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,600
So a cape is a yes, and.

00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,029
Like, I move and the cape moves more!

00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:17,040
In an unexpected way!

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,560
It's a prompt.

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,620
I know there are things I can do with this cape.

00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,620
It's a prop.

00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,620
Like...

00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,260
Maybe it makes me feel like I'm a superhero.

00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,260
It's a partner.

00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,600
It's reacting to my emotion.

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,040
It's making emotion that I can then react to.

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,120
And in animation, this is called secondary motion.

00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,740
This idea that when you move, something else moves with you.

00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:43,820
And so Bugs Bunny's pigtails, Ariel's tale, Bugs Bunny's ears.

00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,060
These are secondary motion.

00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:55,310
At spore, we had a whole system called wiggles and jiggles, figuring out...

00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,760
Should your legs move?

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:04,450
When you run, should your knees move more, or should they be fixed?

00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,300
We got a lot of interesting stuff out this.

00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,019
The animators could make one animation.

00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:11,029
This is their internal animation tool.

00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:12,320
They could say...

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:19,950
Do the jump animation, and with any possible body morphology, what should happen then?

00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:24,740
They could tune this very carefully, so stuff could move in a way that they thought was

00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,950
about right.

00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:27,950
So yeah.

00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:28,950
That's how humans do it.

00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,030
Let's figure out how computers do it.

00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,620
I had to have one all of you AI slide.

00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,760
So now let's talk about dancing with a computer.

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,360
This is not specifically what I mean.

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,480
Although this is something that came out...

00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
Gosh...

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,560
Probably in the early 2000s of a ballroom dance partner out of Japan.

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,160
But we can talk about types of human-computer dance interaction.

00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,980
I wrote a paper...

00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,190
A very short paper...

00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,280
Trying to at least tease these out.

00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:58,180
As far as I can tell, there are three different ways that you can respond to somebody's body

00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,180
movements.

00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,089
There's costumes and wearables, which is like attached physically to your body, which are

00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:04,250
like...

00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,860
Immediate body-centric motions.

00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,430
There's fields, where you're disrupting a field of something, so I'm walking through

00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,680
grass and the grass, like, parts and waves as I move through it.

00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:20,220
Or you're in one of those lagoons with the bioluminescent bacteria, as you move, little

00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,660
sparkle flows flow out around you.

00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,480
And you do that that digitally.

00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,260
And there's agents, where something is capable of acting on its own.

00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,350
And the question is: How does the computer listen?

00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,829
What is it listening to do?

00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:34,829
Your body movement?

00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:35,850
Your heart rate?

00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,980
How does it know your body movement?

00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,370
Is it looking for -- maybe there's a security camera and it's just looking for pixel differences?

00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:44,880
Or is it actually trying to figure out where your skeleton is?

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,000
Is it listening to your voice, trying to match your pitch?

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,120
Things like that.

00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,120
How does it speak?

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,990
Is it making visuals around you?

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,170
Is it making the audio change?

00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,970
Is it physically pressing against you?

00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,264
And then the last one is kind of interesting.

00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:02,800
Because this is a lever that you can kind of tune.

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,290
Is it a mirror or an agent or something in between?

00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,290
So here's a cape.

00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,220
Our good old friend, the improv cape.

00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,981
But this is in Dr. Strange, and his cape is actually a sentient being that fights him

00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:13,981
sometimes.

00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:17,820
And it will change throughout the scene and throughout the choreography of...

00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,820
It's just a cape.

00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,600
I can do things to it.

00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,670
To this object is physically fighting and is a fight partner with me.

00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,690
It's interesting to watch that choreography.

00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:33,420
The one on the bottom is the Marx Brothers, a classic comedy scene where somebody is trying

00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,899
to hide from another person by pretending he's in the mirror but imperfectly matching

00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:38,899
his movements.

00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:43,139
You can have something where I'm looking at the computer and the computer is responding

00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:45,779
to me directly, directly, directly, and then it says...

00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:46,779
Stop.

00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,779
I'm gonna do some improv here.

00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:51,570
So you can tune this back and forth.

00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,570
Oh yeah.

00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:53,570
So...

00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:54,570
Okay.

00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,570
Let's talk a little bit about costumes.

00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,860
I do a little bit of dance.

00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,810
I'm really bad at dance.

00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,820
I am just a casual creator at dance.

00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:06,340
Just dancing well enough to be not horrifying to myself and others, or at least, I have

00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,800
convinced myself that.

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,190
But dance has this wonderful tradition of adding a lot of secondary motion.

00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:17,820
Because as anyone in ballroom dance knows, you have you, your partner, and then you have

00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:23,630
all the flowing dresses around you that augment and basically yes, and your motion.

00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,550
So you do the twirl and the dress says...

00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,550
Wow!

00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,550
What a twirl!

00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:30,649
Or you jump and your fringe says...

00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:31,649
Wow!

00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:32,649
What a jump!

00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:34,810
So your outfit is your hype man.

00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,639
And like anybody who goes to raves knows that this is true.

00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:38,840
You have these flow toys.

00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,050
If you just saw somebody standing there, dancing, doing this, you would be like...

00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,760
Wow, that person is not good at dance.

00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:49,500
But suddenly if there's fire involved, it's great!

00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,430
So again, this is like yes, and for physical gestures.

00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:56,269
Some important things about costumes -- it's locationally, directionally, and temporally

00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:58,100
linked to the movement.

00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,510
So I do this, and my sleeve should do that immediately.

00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,530
I shouldn't do this and then the computer chugs for a while and 15 minutes later it's

00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,530
like...

00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,230
I figured out what to do!

00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,649
It should cause a very direct causal link.

00:17:10,649 --> 00:17:14,850
And the nice thing is you get kind of emergence, when you move and these things persist over

00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:15,850
time.

00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:21,909
So that cool glowing shoe time lapse thing going on down there.

00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:26,339
I went to a taiko drumming thing recently and thought that was really fascinating.

00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:31,380
It's a dance form where you're hitting drums.

00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,380
And so they're like...

00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:37,151
They'll do this, but as the accent to that, the drum is almost like a wearable or a dance

00:17:37,151 --> 00:17:40,859
toy, where as you do this, you get a big boom at the end.

00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:47,950
The one on top is Fred Astaire where he's throwing down those poppers and tap dancing

00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,539
on top of them.

00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:53,759
As his feet hit the ground, there's a snap of his shoe hitting the ground and there's

00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:54,759
a little explosion.

00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:58,299
So it's like taking the normal tap accessory of hitting your shoe against the ground to

00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:02,510
create rhythm but even more so, and you get smoke plumes.

00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,260
I promised y'all more Muppets.

00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,749
We're just gonna keep doing Muppets here.

00:18:07,749 --> 00:18:10,129
I hope everyone is okay with that.

00:18:10,129 --> 00:18:15,229
Muppets are really great, because a lot of this talk was inspired by a visit I did to

00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:17,659
the Atlanta Center for Puppetry Arts, which everyone should go to.

00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:20,749
And the Henson Wing was open and you can see all the Henson Muppets.

00:18:20,749 --> 00:18:22,230
I wasn't looking at a VHS tape for the first time.

00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:27,009
I was looking at the Muppet itself.

00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:28,239
Almost all of them are Muppets.

00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:29,600
They're not bare felt.

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:36,179
Almost all of them have this stuff on them, these dance accessories.

00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:40,779
And they're props that tell you how to move this Muppet.

00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:45,570
Imagine you had Janice over there on your hand and somebody called in sick at the Jim

00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,570
Henson lab.

00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:47,570
Saying...

00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,570
You're a visitor.

00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:49,759
Come in and play Janice for the day.

00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:52,499
Immediately you put her on and you start doing this.

00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:54,450
Because her hair says do that.

00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,649
I forget what that guy's name is, because you start doing this.

00:18:58,649 --> 00:19:00,940
Because his hair wants to do that.

00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,940
These are hand capes.

00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,289
They tell your hand what to do.

00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:10,600
This is great, because you can make people play with puppets easily and have new experiences.

00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,940
So there's an artist, Nick Cave, not that Nick Cave, who makes these things called sound

00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,960
suits that are really incredible, and other people are doing digital animations on top

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,710
of bodies to have these surreal secondary animations all over the body.

00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:24,840
Cats does not do this.

00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,340
There's no body movement in Cats.

00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,059
Why?!?!?!?!

00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:32,429
And just like one whole scene...

00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:36,519
One whole slide of Animal, because Animal is the best.

00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:38,700
Look at all the different things that his hair is doing!

00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,029
Especially in this one, where it's like...

00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:44,440
Movement, movement, movement, and then still.

00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,330
As he's coming to this revelation.

00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:53,320
So his hair and how it moves and when it's still and when it's moving is part of his

00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,460
character.

00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,570
Muppets have almost no facial animation.

00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,799
Many of them don't have eyes.

00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:03,409
Count how many Muppets you think have eyes and then look, and it's almost none of them!

00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:05,470
The Swedish Chef has almost nothing on his face.

00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,409
He's like a nose with eyebrows!

00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:14,009
And yet you would swear up and down that you've seen the Swedish Chef blink!

00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:16,120
And again, it's all this secondary animation.

00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,970
So yeah.

00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:22,039
I actually got to play a little bit with this, in a project that I did for Google Creative

00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:23,039
Labs.

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,059
They had something that was kind of like the Kinect, but for a regular webcam, so it was

00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,769
able to detect your body pose.

00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:36,169
It didn't end up working out and this didn't end up shipping, but this was me trying to

00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:40,649
interpret Nick Cave's sound suits and Muppets into a digital costume people could wear.

00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:45,789
They wanted something so people could download an app, walk in front of their webcam, and

00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:46,909
do something.

00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:50,359
We know from before how bad "do something" is.

00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:57,480
So I wanted to give them a costume so they would walk in front of the camera and imagine

00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,759
they had very long arms and a giant mohawk.

00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:04,119
You would move in different ways.

00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:07,970
There's a bunch of mask theory stuff you can go into, of like...

00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:12,909
When you look at yourself and you're not yourself, you suddenly have wild freedom.

00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:18,019
As exposited by The Mask, 1995, Jim Carrey?

00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:19,840
It's nonfiction, people!

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,659
But yeah.

00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:27,289
So that's like another way to get people over their fear of creativity, is to look at themselves

00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:29,570
as not themselves.

00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:38,630
I had a little virtual body, and this is controlled with Perl in Noise, but at that point, I didn't

00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,520
have access to body data, so I faked my own.

00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:51,700
You can remap that, accent the curves in different ways, and I wound up with different body costumes

00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,570
that mimic your limbs in different ways.

00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:59,210
One of these days I'll ship this when the technology becomes more available.

00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:05,830
But the most important thing in this sort of project is immediacy, and the second most

00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,179
important is connection.

00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:09,220
Knowing that you have influenced the world.

00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,610
But that's often driven by immediacy.

00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:17,950
I did a lot of research on various academic projects.

00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,549
There's a lot of generative dance out there.

00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:22,799
Especially in the computational creativity community.

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,269
I don't think they're getting it right.

00:22:25,269 --> 00:22:31,320
There are a couple of projects that are getting it more right, so I wanted to show you a couple

00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,320
of those.

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,730
This is Lumen AI, a huge multiperson project out of Georgia Tech.

00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:42,710
There's a dome and you're in there with a virtual shadow that's dancing.

00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:47,340
One of the issues, though, is that what they chose to do was not immediate.

00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,289
They decided to go very agent-based, where this thing is autonomous.

00:22:50,289 --> 00:22:54,909
So you dance for a while and you pause and it will dance like you, except you're not

00:22:54,909 --> 00:23:01,179
sure if it's improving or the Kinect stopped working or it's just doing really creative

00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:03,019
improv.

00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:04,389
So this has one of the issues.

00:23:04,389 --> 00:23:09,530
That if you as the designer cannot tell whether or not the Kinect is plugged in, anybody who

00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:14,679
has been in this space making a really creative thing that yields some input and you're like...

00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:16,229
Wow, it's doing it really well, it's doing it really well...

00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,840
Oh, the socket wasn't plugged in...

00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,159
Yeah.

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,190
You can easily lie to yourself that more improv is happening and not just noise.

00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:29,259
This is another project from Google that did end up using that TensorFlow stuff.

00:23:29,259 --> 00:23:33,200
You can see kind of how janky -- it's following the body.

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,610
So what they did is they very cleverly didn't do a continuous thing.

00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,840
It feels almost continuous.

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:44,710
But it's just searching the Google library for the pose that most closely fits your thing.

00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:50,909
So it's disconnected and kind of jank, but that's very cleverly papering over an issue

00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:53,340
with the software.

00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,599
I'm running out of time, so I'll just go through this real quick.

00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:59,200
Oculus First Steps does some great stuff improving with the robot and you get to hold hands with

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,629
the robot, the only time I've been able to hold hands with something in VR, which is

00:24:02,629 --> 00:24:03,629
amazing.

00:24:03,629 --> 00:24:06,090
But this is the demo and it's awful.

00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:10,639
The whole question is: What is dance about?

00:24:10,639 --> 00:24:13,099
There's dance notation.

00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:19,750
You have to notate arm positions, physical positions, where you are in relationship to

00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:24,570
your partner, which is that ornate scrolly thing, and there's a whole book on dance notation

00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:28,679
that is fascinating to a computer scientist.

00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:34,440
But I do ballroom dance and swing, and I think of them as forces.

00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,529
The one on the bottom is somebody at Google who did this, and they were assigned to do

00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:38,690
this, and they hand...

00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:39,690
Swung danced?...

00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:40,690
Before.

00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,850
And I was like...

00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,250
Here, let's swing dance.

00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,159
See how it's all about your forces?

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,409
You're pulling back and forth.

00:24:47,409 --> 00:24:50,659
They ended up capturing that really nicely.

00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:52,279
So I do a lot of stuff with particles.

00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:56,799
This is a lot of stuff with particles.

00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,309
I do hand tracking.

00:24:58,309 --> 00:25:02,850
Make yourself a set of infinite virtual hands that do this, and that way, you don't have

00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:06,190
to switch between that all the time.

00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:10,460
I have a lot of virtual hands that oscillate forever.

00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:14,379
And then just particles that respond to those hands in some way.

00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:16,929
They're either following them or just kind of...

00:25:16,929 --> 00:25:17,979
Attracted to them.

00:25:17,979 --> 00:25:19,640
Or generated from them.

00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,489
And so I had this game that I had made a while back, called Falling For You, that's dead

00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:30,519
from bitrot, but you have people falling through space and falling in love and making polyamorous

00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:32,679
families.

00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:35,309
Which is accidental, because people have two hands, so obviously...

00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:38,179
But that's just springs and particles.

00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:40,710
There's no actual body animation in here.

00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,500
It's just springs and particles and force between them.

00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:48,830
Inverse kinematics is something that happens to bad people.

00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:51,760
Anyway...

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,760
So yeah.

00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,760
I was like...

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,760
I can make a body out of that.

00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,969
And if I've got springs and particles, then I can add dance Tribbles...

00:25:58,969 --> 00:25:59,969
I know I'm out of time.

00:25:59,969 --> 00:26:03,389
So I'll rush through the rest of this, but I want to get into Dance Tribbles.

00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:06,039
I don't want to say that and leave.

00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:11,320
So you have a Dance Tribble, a little sentient being that likes bass beats, and every time

00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,619
it hears a bass beat, it'll pull up your hand.

00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:23,690
Another one likes treble beats, so you have a rudimentary way to define force-based choreography.

00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:29,080
So I started making a generator for this.

00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,979
I had AI...

00:26:31,979 --> 00:26:36,700
Genetic algorithm-based bodies, so you could evolve little different dance morphologies,

00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:43,289
a dance descriptor, so I got to put that -- jazz hands in an actual academic paper.

00:26:43,289 --> 00:26:48,219
And this is like applying Dance Tribbles to arbitrary meshes.

00:26:48,219 --> 00:26:52,289
You can see they're mostly working out here.

00:26:52,289 --> 00:27:04,870
I'll let this go for one and a half songs.

00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,100
(chill Latin music)

00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,330
Come on, Switch.

00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,330
Yeah.

00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,330
So anyway...

00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,039
You can see that you can get kind of different stuff going on.

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,909
If I added that to that, I got something that in fact did not work at all.

00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:15,909
(laughter)

00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:19,619
I will revisit this someday.

00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:20,619
So yeah.

00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:23,299
We have more input devices than ever.

00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:29,309
We have Kinects and PoseNet, LeapMotion, Oculus controls can now listen to your bare hands,

00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:33,739
so you can do fancy hand tracking, and so far all that anybody is using them for is

00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:34,749
a button!

00:27:34,749 --> 00:27:35,749
Like...

00:27:35,749 --> 00:27:36,749
Do this to press a button!

00:27:36,749 --> 00:27:37,809
Do that to press a button!

00:27:37,809 --> 00:27:39,639
Do this to press a button!

00:27:39,639 --> 00:27:41,809
They're not responding continuously.

00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:43,880
So my question here...

00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,440
And this is just a bunch of random stuff that I've made...

00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,730
To respond to like hand tracking things...

00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,409
How would you make...

00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:54,039
So what is the future?

00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,559
I tried to search for VR puppets.

00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:57,559
And there's...

00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:00,969
That one up there, and then it's mostly scary puppets that follow you in the dark.

00:28:00,969 --> 00:28:03,519
No one is actually having you be the puppets.

00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:05,339
It's dreadful.

00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:08,120
And the one in the middle is the Waldo System, which is basically...

00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:13,749
You do this with your hand and this is how the Muppets did a lot of their long distance

00:28:13,749 --> 00:28:15,710
Muppetry.

00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,710
But we're not...

00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:21,479
We haven't revisited that 1980s technology but now with good hand tracking.

00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:22,479
So yeah.

00:28:22,479 --> 00:28:23,879
Any questions?

00:28:23,879 --> 00:28:24,999
This is my talk.

00:28:24,999 --> 00:28:25,999
Meet me outside.

00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:30,179
We can talk more about Muppets or I can teach you how to polka.

00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:31,179
And yeah.

00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:37,389
Max, who is in here somewhere, and I are doing a workshop in casual creators, at ICCC in

00:28:37,389 --> 00:28:40,580
Portugal this year, if anybody has anything to send to us.

00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,580
But yeah.

00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,679
