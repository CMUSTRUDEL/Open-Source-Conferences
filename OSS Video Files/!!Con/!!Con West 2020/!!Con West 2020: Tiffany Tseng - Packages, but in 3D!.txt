Ever received a beautiful geometric gift box (from a Japanese pastry shop, for example) and wondered how it was made? It turns out there’s a whole world of packaging design techniques and patterns! Unfortunately, many of these patterns exist only in print via packaging design books. These diagrams need to be translated to digital formats before they can be easily cut on a machine and assembled by hand!

In this talk, I’ll share how I built a web app called SVG Tracer (https://svg-tracer.glitch.me/) to translate photos of packaging diagrams to digital SVGs that can be directly sent to any Computer Numeric Controlled (CNC) desktop cutter. I’ll introduce some useful JavaScript SVG libraries and show some pretty boxes that I created with the tool! By the end of the talk, you’ll learn about how SVGs are an awesome medium for bridging art, programming, and fabrication.
