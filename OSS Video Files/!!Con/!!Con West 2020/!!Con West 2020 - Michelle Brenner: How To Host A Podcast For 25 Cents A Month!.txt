Want to host a podcast, but don’t know where to start? I have answers!! Last year I launched From The Source, where I interview unsung people in tech with amazing stories. Hosting involves three major components: an XML file with episode details, mp3 storage, and metrics on your listeners. In this talk, I’ll go over all the AWS tools and Python scripts I used so I could own my data and not incur hefty hosting fees.

During this talk, I will be creating a fresh podcast from scratch, with only a few pre-prepared items like any good cooking show. Together we’ll upload the MP3 file to S3 and then create an XML file and upload that as well. You can then pull the feed onto your phone using any podcast app and download the episode. After we download the episode, we can parse the S3 logs using Athena to see who has been listening. And finally, I’ll show you a bonus script that helps with the worst part of hosting a podcast: editing.

At the end of the talk, all you’ll need to worry about is which story you want to tell on your own podcast.
