Title: !!Con West 2020 - Michelle Brenner: How To Host A Podcast For 25 Cents A Month!
Publication date: 2020-03-23
Playlist: !!Con West 2020
Description: 
	Presented at !!Con West 2020: http://bangbangcon.com/west

Want to host a podcast, but don’t know where to start? I have answers!! Last year I launched From The Source, where I interview unsung people in tech with amazing stories. Hosting involves three major components: an XML file with episode details, mp3 storage, and metrics on your listeners. In this talk, I’ll go over all the AWS tools and Python scripts I used so I could own my data and not incur hefty hosting fees.

During this talk, I will be creating a fresh podcast from scratch, with only a few pre-prepared items like any good cooking show. Together we’ll upload the MP3 file to S3 and then create an XML file and upload that as well. You can then pull the feed onto your phone using any podcast app and download the episode. After we download the episode, we can parse the S3 logs using Athena to see who has been listening. And finally, I’ll show you a bonus script that helps with the worst part of hosting a podcast: editing.

At the end of the talk, all you’ll need to worry about is which story you want to tell on your own podcast.

Alright. So I host this podcast called From the Source.

00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:32,920
Where I interview people working in tech, and I focus on underrepresented voices, and

00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,010
to answer the question of what a tech job really is like, both the good, the bad, and

00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,160
the boring.

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,290
So when I wanted to do this project, I didn't want to spend a lot of money.

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,230
So that's how I came up with this idea.

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,300
So let's talk about why you should host a podcast.

00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,350
First of all, no one can stop you.

00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:58,870
It's not like book publishing or TV or movies, where there's just a level of professionalism

00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,850
and then the amateur stuff.

00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,110
Your podcast will be in the same catalog at Serial.

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,210
You might have less advertising for people to find it, but it's in the same place.

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,520
Learning new skills.

00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:17,240
So learning how to interview people, learning how to edit audio -- these are all things

00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,020
that I hadn't done before.

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,770
And they enhance other things in my life.

00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,110
Learning how to interview helped me interact better with people.

00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:28,790
I mean, it helps you make new friends to be interested in other people.

00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:34,039
For some reason, people still think you're cool when you host a podcast.

00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:37,859
I tell people I host a podcast and they're like wow, really?

00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:39,460
That's so neat?!

00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,119
I'm like yeah, I'm awesome.

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,479
I got to reach a whole new community.

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,799
As much as I love all of you in the tech community, it's really nice to see what other people

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:50,799
are up to.

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,310
So I'm in the Lady Pod Squad.

00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,920
It's super fun.

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,950
They're all over the world.

00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,659
The last thing is to make money, which is a total trick.

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,390
You will make zero dollars!

00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,390
(laughter)

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,760
Unless you are already an influencer or have infinite free time.

00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:16,000
Or you're best friends with someone at Caspar Mattresses.

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You won't make any money.

00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,470
But the whole point of this is not to make money, but kind of enhance your brand.

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,750
Things like that.

00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,540
One of the things that's really great for me is if I go to a stranger and say...

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,540
Hey, you're really interesting.

00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,700
Can I talk to you for an hour?

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,320
They just kind of run away.

00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,130
But if I say: Hey, can I interview you for my podcast?

00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,120
And ask you things about your life?

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,260
They're like...

00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,970
Oh my God!

00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:41,970
Me?!

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,670
And then it's super fun.

00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,470
So what we're gonna do today is talk about hosting.

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,400
So when you use managed hosting, and there's a ton of different options, you either pay

00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:03,270
out a monthly fee, like $10 to $15, or like any SaaS product, they're using your data.

00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,140
So they're selling to your customers, just figuring things out...

00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,870
They need a way to make money.

00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,970
So when you're self-hosting, you're in charge of all of that.

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,270
So let's make a podcast right now.

00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:18,020
That's what we're gonna do.

00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,020
Okay.

00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:25,220
So what I use is Amazon S3 and I'm gonna create a new bucket.

00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:31,290
So if you're not familiar with S3, it's basically like Dropbox or Google Drive.

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:36,840
It's just a way to store files and folders.

00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,140
And if you haven't made an account before, one big thing you should know -- and I should

00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,930
have put this first -- is create a budget.

00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,360
So when you sign up, the first thing you do actually is create 2FA.

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,060
Use your two factor authentication, and create a budget so you don't play around with Amazon

00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,410
and get a $75 bill by accident.

00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,040
That definitely didn't happen to me.

00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,480
So now my budget is set at $2.50.

00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,160
I'm very pricey now.

00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,690
My bill is at $0.52.

00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:11,691
Which I grant is more than $0.25, but I've been using S3 as storage since I ran out of

00:04:11,691 --> 00:04:14,330
space on Google Drive.

00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,150
So those are two things you should do at the beginning.

00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:21,620
And there are tutorials for those as well if you haven't used it before.

00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,620
Okay.

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,620
So let's go to S3.

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,919
So S3...

00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:29,199
I wasn't sure how great it would be for me to show everyone all my S3 buckets, but please

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,260
don't do anything to me, I guess?!

00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,030
I really didn't think this through.

00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,509
So let's create a new podcast.

00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:40,650
So this is my Twitter handle.

00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:47,330
So you can all find me and I can be popular.

00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,889
I'm in the US West.

00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:54,590
I'm just basically making a new directory for the podcast.

00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,659
And it's really big.

00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:56,680
So I'm hoping...

00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,990
I'll actually run this wizard.

00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,330
So...

00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,560
I'm looking for making sure I can make this public.

00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,852
I think it's in the next one.

00:05:06,852 --> 00:05:08,599
Basically ignoring everything is what I want.

00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:12,699
So people get in a lot of trouble from the public S3 bucket, so they've made it pretty

00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:13,699
clear...

00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:17,760
It automatically defaults to not public.

00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,760
Which is great.

00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,000
Except I want everything here to be public.

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,430
So if anyone gets in trouble for a public S3 bucket, after you've seen this, you can

00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:29,120
just make fun of them, because it's actually much harder to make it public.

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,020
Where is it?

00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:39,620
I'm just gonna make it a little smaller so I can see.

00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,330
There it is.

00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,970
Yeah.

00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:55,080
Like, how do people do this?

00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:01,629
By accident.

00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:06,590
So my new bucket...

00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,669
I'm gonna create one more for logs.

00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:13,560
I'm just gonna use the same name...

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,990
If I can spell my own name correctly...

00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,099
Okay.

00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:21,580
Don't need all that.

00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,169
Don't need any of that.

00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:28,840
And this one will not be public.

00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,330
This is all your log data.

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,400
So you just let it go.

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,639
So I've already made a mistake.

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,840
Which is the fun of live demos.

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,420
And I'm gonna just start over on my one bucket, because I should have made the log bucket

00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,830
first.

00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:47,300
Because the podcast bucket needs somewhere to put its logs.

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,460
And it didn't exist at that time.

00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,199
So I couldn't put it there.

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,819
So I'm gonna real quick delete...

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,640
Okay.

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,520
So those should be in here somewhere.

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,590
Logging.

00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,860
Ah, there it is.

00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,439
I missed it.

00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:30,949
So this is important.

00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:36,289
Because when you're not using managed hosting, there's no one to collect all your data for

00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,289
you.

00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:41,479
But when you're using S3, it logs in who downloaded your podcast.

00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:45,629
Not, like, their name, but they used an iPhone and they used this app.

00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:51,659
And I don't have time to get into it today, but in my blog, I'll show you how to use that

00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:59,750
data and parse it and things like that.

00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:05,809
So I'll make it public again.

00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:11,419
Okay.

00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:14,909
So I need to create two folders in here.

00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:21,639
One is gonna be audio file.

00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:27,169
Save.

00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:28,169
I'm just kidding.

00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:30,909
I need to create three folders in here.

00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:32,959
Okay.

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:34,320
So there's three things I created.

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,320
Three folders.

00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,419
So one of them is gonna hold your mp3s.

00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:41,340
The other one is gonna hold your images.

00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,300
So when you load a podcast, the little square you see at the bottom...

00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,460
And then the ones you see on each episode, we can put them all in one folder.

00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,620
And then the RSS is kind of the most important.

00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,610
So that's basically telling everyone where your podcast is.

00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,750
Telling them where the image and the audio is.

00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:08,620
So I'm gonna -- first I'm gonna upload the image and the audio.

00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,660
This is the wrong folder.

00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,810
Don't look.

00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,860
I was, like, I'll just have a folder ready with everything in it.

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,110
I didn't.

00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,110
Okay.

00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,399
So in this audio bucket, here's an mp3.

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,370
This isn't the right screen.

00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,889
I have to actually hit upload.

00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:31,500
It looks like you could, but you can't do that.

00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,449
And this should go pretty fast.

00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:40,310
I think this also asks you whether it should be public.

00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,310
Yes.

00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:49,510
Everyone needs to listen to my podcasts.

00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:55,740
Just let it be the default storage...

00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,100
And that's done.

00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:04,029
And then just an image.

00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:07,389
Just use my face, so you don't forget me.

00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:10,100
Moving the image in.

00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,160
Same deal.

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:22,720
Make sure it's public.

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,800
And I'm gonna show you the RSS file.

00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,450
So this is an XML.

00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:31,560
And it's pretty straightforward, in that everything is what you think it is.

00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,560
So, like, title of the podcast.

00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,560
Description.

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,130
Things like that.

00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,079
And I'm running out of time, so...

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,930
I'm not gonna add more to this.

00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,990
But you can -- I've linked to this in the blog post, and you can download it, but it's

00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:49,250
basically just saying: Here's the podcast and then there's an item for each episode.

00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,810
And you can tell I forget to completely edit it, because you can see my original podcast

00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:53,810
name.

00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,520
Still in there.

00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:04,130
We're almost done.

00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,670
Actually...

00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:13,470
So I would upload this.

00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:19,940
One thing to note -- I'm gonna edit it -- you should put the right locations of things.

00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:24,370
So this is the image.

00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,370
So if I went back...

00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:32,760
I really need this.

00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,930
So I just need this.

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,009
I just need the object URL.

00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:44,280
And then for the audio...

00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,130
You don't just need the URL.

00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,310
You need...

00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:53,259
The size and also the length that also goes in the RSS.

00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:57,930
I don't have time to finish all that, so we're just gonna go to the one that I've already

00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,920
made, and you can try it out.

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:12,990
So you can just see what it looks like on your phone.

00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:22,410
So if you have a podcast app, and you try to go to that URL, you should get a podcast.

00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,070
I tried it and this one works.

00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,070
Not the one that I just didn't finish.

00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,070
So...

00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,070
I think I'm completely out of time.

00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,209
So thank you very much!

00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:30,389
Thank you for letting me go over.

00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:33,680
