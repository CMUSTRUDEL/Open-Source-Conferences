Consider two programming languages, both delightfully strange, but for good reasons. What if comparing them sheds light on how different programming languages enable thinking about time and data?

Inform 7 is an unusual programming language that looks a bit like English prose. Alloy is a model specification language that looks kind of like advanced math. They are languages from two different worlds, but both are about objects and their relationships. Both come with interesting visualization tools. And both have some issues dealing with change. In this talk, we’ll implement an ancient puzzle in both languages, explore their unique charms, and reflect on whether it’s possible to step into the same river twice.
