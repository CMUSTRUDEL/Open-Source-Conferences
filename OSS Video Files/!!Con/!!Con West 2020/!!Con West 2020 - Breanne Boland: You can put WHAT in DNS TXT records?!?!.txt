DNS TXT resource records have several more common uses: SPF records, contact information, randomized strings put in place so hosting services can verify that someone does indeed control a domain. But the spec for them in RFC 1035 is pretty short: “TXT RRs are used to hold descriptive text. The semantics of the text depends on the domain where it is found.” And Corey Quinn calls Route 53, the AWS DNS service, his favorite database, because it has a 100% SLA. There’s room for a LOT of mischief in between those two descriptions. This talk will give a brief explanation of DNS and its record types, discuss the officially endorsed uses of TXT records… and then look into what kind of fun someone can have with the more off-brand uses (like thwarting attempts at internet censorship!).
