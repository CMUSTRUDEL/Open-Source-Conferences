Video games can be cool, right? You know what’s cooler? A hex editor!

For a while I’ve made a hobby of figuring out how games store their data, and converting it to and from other formats. I’m far from the only one to do that, but I want to share what I have learned so that you don’t have to start from scratch: things like how a hex editor works, what floating point looks like, file structures and layout, and more general reversing strategies.
