This is a dance inspired by broadcast audio through RSS, technology obsolescence, Git version controls, and 3-2-1 backups. Sounds recorded from earlier talks will be regenerated to create auditory memories of early digital networking and are made tangible through isolated limbed branches that build to a feeling of potential completion. It soon breaks down as segments are gradually destroyed due to algorithmically-controlled centralized over-saturation. This is an exploration of existing digital archiving techniques that are missing components to recreate the full computational environment.

linkRot is a dance that serves to emulate the physical euphoria that internet content creation permits to the digital decay that comes with loss (or is there even a feeling of loss?).
