If you wanted to print a diagram on a piece of paper in the 60s, a pen plotter was the way to do it – a device that would take a pen and physically move it over a piece of paper to produce a diagram. While printers are clearly a better way to print images now, there’s still joy in watching a robot scratch out perfect lines on a blank sheet of paper. When I happened across a vintage pen plotter from the mid-80s, I had great fun making all sorts of art and pretty pictures. But I wondered – could I do more with this? How can we stretch this medium into something new and surprising? Using it as an output device for playing games seemed too good an idea to resist.
