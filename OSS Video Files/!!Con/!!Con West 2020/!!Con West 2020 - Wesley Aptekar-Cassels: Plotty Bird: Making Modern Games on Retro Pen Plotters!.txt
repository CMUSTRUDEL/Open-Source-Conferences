If you wanted to print a diagram on a piece of paper in the 60s, a pen plotter was the way to do it – a device that would take a pen and physically move it over a piece of paper to produce a diagram. While printers are clearly a better way to print images now, there’s still joy in watching a robot scratch out perfect lines on a blank sheet of paper. When I happened across a vintage pen plotter from the mid-80s, I had great fun making all sorts of art and pretty pictures. But I wondered – could I do more with this? How can we stretch this medium into something new and surprising? Using it as an output device for playing games seemed too good an idea to resist.

Hey, everybody.

00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:28,420
So my name is Wesley.

00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:33,180
I use they/them pronouns, and today I'm going to be talking a little bit about pen plotters

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,770
and some fun things that I found with pen plotters.

00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,610
You may be asking yourself: What is a pen plotter.

00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:44,120
And in the '80s, before printers really worked well at all -- as if they work well today

00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,530
-- if you wanted to print an image, what you would do is you would use a little robot that

00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,320
took a pen and it could move the pen in two directions and lift it up and put it down

00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,730
and it could select some other pens.

00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,440
This is how you could make graphics.

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,010
If you were an engineer and you wanted to have drafting drawings or if you were a business

00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:08,500
person and you wanted to give presentations on your overhead transparencies, this is how

00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,500
you would do it.

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,890
So why would you do it?

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,830
That's the reason.

00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,970
So of course, successful presentations use graphics.

00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:23,610
So this is from the HP Color Pro Pen Plotter.

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,470
One thing I like about this image -- you notice on the chart on the right we're projecting

00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:33,350
far into the future, of the year 1987.

00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,380
So I bought this pen plotter and went looking for documentation.

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,810
One thing that I found was the sales guide for this plotter.

00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:46,850
You can see it advertises itself as quality presentations for business leaders.

00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,520
Very fancy.

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,100
So I found the instructions for how to sell this plotter.

00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,869
And so I do make presentations.

00:01:56,869 --> 00:01:59,229
Here I am!

00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,880
I don't use an overhead projector.

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,780
But I do want to make better presentations.

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,130
So two out of three.

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,780
It's starting to look like I should buy this plotter.

00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:16,260
And in the Secrets to Closing, they say I should ask if I have a presentation upcoming

00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,920
in the next few weeks.

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,270
Here I am.

00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:26,090
And finally my favorite is: You only pay for quality once.

00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:32,730
So who knows -- could be using this plotter in the year 2020...

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,420
So now that I bought this plotter, how do I actually use it?

00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,010
Luckily, the manual has some more instructions.

00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,870
They have this handy little chart.

00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:47,100
So you take a software package on a floppy disc, or a piece of paper with a graphics

00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:52,430
program on it, you stick that into your computer, and then out the squiggly little cable -- I

00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,819
think this bend in the cable is very important.

00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:59,750
It goes into the plotter, and pictures come out.

00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,130
So what do these HP-GL instructions actually look like?

00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,640
So here is a very simple program that we'll walk through.

00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,770
So first we initialize the plotter.

00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,879
That's what the IN is.

00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,550
And select the first pen.

00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:22,000
Then we'll move the pen to location 1000,1000, we'll put the pen down, move it around more,

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,080
draw a little square, and finally pick the pen up so it doesn't bleed all over the paper.

00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,940
This is great.

00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,600
We've off drawn a square all over the place. Everything is good.

00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,620
But there's actually a problem.

00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:36,319
So I go back and I look at the manual again.

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,220
We can see I have the HP ColorPro on the right there.

00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,100
The buffer size is 60 bytes.

00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,099
So if you look at this program, this program is 86 bytes long.

00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:52,010
So these last 26 bytes are not having a good time.

00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,010
Not making it to the plotter.

00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,690
So that's a problem.

00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,580
You know, I go back to the salesperson.

00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,580
I say...

00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,330
Hey, I can't even draw a square!

00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,080
What am I supposed to do with this plotter?

00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,019
But he tells me: Don't worry about it!

00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:05,450
I have the perfect solution for you.

00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:11,319
All you have to do is just buy the Hewlett-Packard graphics expansion cartridge.

00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,879
This will snap into the bottom of your plotter.

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,549
It will give you a luxurious 1024 bytes.

00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:17,549
What more could you need?

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,510
You could draw ten squares that way!

00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,489
It's perfect.

00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:26,800
It turns out that the graphics extension cartridge is a little bit hard to come by these days.

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,240
So I need to go and find a different solution.

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,400
So what I did was I said...

00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,660
Well, we have all of these commands.

00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,180
And after each command, I can say: OA.

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:42,711
And what OA does is it tells the plotter: Output the current position of the pen, and

00:04:42,711 --> 00:04:44,330
just let me read it back.

00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,990
So now what I can do is I can send the first command and I can wait until I see a response,

00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,430
and that will tell me that the plotter has finished taking the command and I can send

00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,430
the next one.

00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,840
I’ll send each in a row.

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,240
I will be able to plot all sorts of pretty pictures.

00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,260
We figured out a solution.

00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,100
I don't need to buy the graphics expansion cartridge.

00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,680
I can do it all on our own.

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,280
So now we're in business.

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,960
We're making all sorts of pretty pictures.

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,830
Plotting all kinds of nice things.

00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:21,990
And most importantly, making some very serious presentations.

00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:27,190
You know, all sorts of serious stuff.

00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,650
So this is...

00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,900
I was showing my friends all of this.

00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,009
And they asked me...

00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:33,490
Oh, this is cool!

00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,430
Could you hook up a mouse to it?

00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,580
So can you take a mouse, and then use a computer mouse to draw on the plotter?

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,110
And I thought about this for a moment.

00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,110
I was like...

00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,550
That shouldn't be too hard.

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,550
So I spent about an hour.

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,320
I went in and typed up the code.

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,770
And we had great fun playing around with this.

00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:57,140
And then of course, this opens up the possibility for all sorts of interesting plotter games.

00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,790
So the first idea that I had was: I’ll have the plotter generate a maze for you, and it'll

00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:06,960
just draw out a maze and you can go in with the mouse, go through the maze, and solve

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,960
it.

00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,740
So this was a little prototype of that.

00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,970
It turns out that just going through a maze isn't that much fun.

00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:13,970
I don't know.

00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,740
I mean, I guess when you're a kid and you need something to do -- but it didn't really

00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,039
cut it for me.

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,770
So what I decided to do instead was...

00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,310
Make Flappy Bird on the pen plotter.

00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:34,520
So what this will do is go and draw out a level with randomized pipes and everything

00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,910
like that.

00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,830
And then...

00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:45,820
Once it's finished drawing out this level, you can go and play Flappy Bird on your vintage

00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,230
pen plotter.

00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:58,639
So it draws a little explosion when you don't make it.

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:04,280
And then when you finally do, it draws a little birdy for you.

00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,730
Just as a...

00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,550
So...

00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,160
Oh, this is a different one that we won't play.

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,669
So that was lots of fun.

00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:19,669
But there's one problem.

00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:22,730
Which is: If you've played Flappy Bird, you know it goes on forever.

00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:23,730
Right?

00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,419
But my plotter is only 8.5x11.

00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:30,640
Which is not really a fun Flappy Bird size.

00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,750
So what can we do about this?

00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:36,569
Well, it turns out that if you try to draw past 11 inches, the plotter just won't let

00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:37,569
you do that.

00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:42,520
So I was thinking about trying to solve this problem and the thing I can think of was...

00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,970
I can just take apart the plotter and go in and fix it myself.

00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,430
So luckily, the plotter actually comes with super nice documentation.

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:55,460
So, for instance, they have all these beautiful line drawings and exploded diagrams.

00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,449
They also have circuit diagrams for the entire thing.

00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:01,420
This is the whole logic board of the plotter.

00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:06,170
So you can take it apart and know what every piece is.

00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,260
And so the ROM is on here.

00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,889
This is the little chip that holds all of the code that decides that you can't draw

00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:13,960
past 11 inches.

00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,010
This is an 8051 system, which is pretty nice little architecture.

00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:23,500
So I can take apart my plotter, hook up my logic analyzer to it.

00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,480
It turns out that doing this with the logic analyzer is a pain in the ass.

00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:34,279
So what you can do instead is just desolder the chip, and then dump the ROM, and you have

00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,489
a bunch of Assembly.

00:08:35,489 --> 00:08:39,579
You have 16 kilobytes of this stuff.

00:08:39,579 --> 00:08:44,499
And so at this point, I ran out of time to reverse engineer this.

00:08:44,499 --> 00:08:50,600
So if you are interested in 8051 Assembly and vintage hardware and are enterprising,

00:08:50,600 --> 00:09:00,819
I have the ROM up on GitHub, and I am looking forward to diving into it more.

00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:02,029
This is about how far I got.

00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:07,300
And I just wanted to -- before I leave -- talk a little bit about sort of why I did this.

00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,050
And why I think this is interesting.

00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:15,319
Basically, when I was programming just for fun, and not as a job, I really enjoyed it.

00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:17,889
And then programming became my profession.

00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:21,480
And I was writing code at work.

00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,639
To make a bunch of executives richer and pay my rent.

00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:26,899
And that just wasn't that fun.

00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,579
And then that sucked a lot of the joy out of programming in my personal life.

00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:36,129
And the way that I finally got back into it was just making art, and making things that

00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:39,670
are stupid, and pointless, and that make people smile.

00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:44,269
And this project has been really great for bringing a little bit of joy into people's

00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:45,269
lives.

00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:46,559
And surprise.

00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,959
And finally, if you would like to play Plotty Bird, I'm going to be giving a demo of it

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,189
in the break after this block of sections.

00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:54,189
Down there.

00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:56,119
I have the plotter here.

00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:59,360
And then one more note is: I came here from New York City.

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,060
And I do not want to bring this plotter back.

00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,619
So if you would like me to practice my sales pitch that I have learned expertly from this

00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,120
manual, please do come talk to me after the talk.

00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,040
