Description: 
	Presented at !!Con West 2020: http://bangbangcon.com/west

My virtual reality hair-cutting game Bizarre Barber started as a graduate thesis, so I couldn’t afford to hire professional 3D modelers and riggers to help out with character designs. My team decided to employ a procedural pipeline and write a tool that would allow us to generate thousands of characters.

With the help of Houdini, Vex and Python, we set up a generator to make a variety of cute birds and mutants with bold hairstyles and automatically export them to the game engine for further processing.

Sound awesome? Well, little did I know about human biases that would start to emerge when an artist turns into a curator and has to make tough decisions…

Hi.

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,620
I'm Maria.

00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,630
I'm based in New York.

00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,050
And I'm a game designer and VR developer.

00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:38,380
When most people think about virtual reality or imagine its future, they usually imagine

00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,380
that.

00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:45,700
When in fact, my version of the bright future of utopian technocratic Singularity looks

00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,200
more like this.

♾ Sing Singularity ♾

00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,240
✂ With Us ✂

00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,180
(laughter)

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,240
So yeah!

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,260
That was the trailer for my game, Bizarre Barber, that was actually released four days ago.

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,440
(applause and cheering)

00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,440
Thank you.

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,740
And this is how I describe my job in a nutshell.

00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:45,940
So instead of saying I'm fiddling all day with very badly written Unity API, I just

00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,750
say this.

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,940
I create sophisticated life forms.

00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,660
Like that.

00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,740
(laughter)

00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,460
So yes, actually, I was very lucky to get funding for the game.

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,420
And...

00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,380
The funding was tight.

00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,090
It was indie.

00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,450
And we had to make characters.

00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,580
And characters are hard on an indie budget.

00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:14,780
These are all stages of, like, typical development cycle of character for a video game.

00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,020
Except for VR, it also has to be very well optimized.

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,700
So how to do this on a budget?

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,220
Especially if we need to make thousands of them.

00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,020
So in our initial game design document, we had this idea, to have like roughly -- like you saw

00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,780
these mutant heads coming at you.

00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,020
Roughly 40, 50 mutants per level. And then it would be 13 levels.

00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,560
And then we'll have birds for doing fancy things with motion.

00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:49,670
Then we'll have bosses, then we'll have custom animals, and we have a three person team for all of that.

00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,160
So we needed to make about 1,000 characters.

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,220
And we decided that computer magic will save us.

00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,820
Procgen! (Procedural Generation)

00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,640
Computers are great at generating things, right?

00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,700
So we started in a very traditional way with the concept art process.

00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:08,870
Started doodling on paper.

00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,230
And then we did doodles in VR.

00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,160
And then we started to make the first generated sketches in Houdini.

00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,360
That basically consisted of combined primitives.

00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,160
We combined them according to certain rules.

00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:29,100
Houdini is actually a very great 3D package for 3D modeling and visual effects and stuff like that.

00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,120
The good thing about Houdini is that it's basically a glorified spreadsheet.

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,540
So you can model 3D things without even touching like a single vertex, without doing it in

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,650
a traditional way, like artists are doing that, like sculpting and drawing stuff.

00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,080
You can basically program all those things.

00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,050
So this is a head.

00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,390
This is the code for the head.

00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,379
So in Houdini, you program with nodes.

00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:58,930
Basically every node is like some operation on a system level.

00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,460
And when you combine them together, it makes... things.

00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,500
Only on occasion we've been writing custom nodes.

00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,870
Basically like...

00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,300
Most of the Houdini instruments are pretty well written for just: Make this.

00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,400
And here you see the nose.

00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:20,930
So this is like basically the structure, the rule, the description, the ideal platonic model

00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,340
of the nose.

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,720
That was first test results.

00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:27,729
Manual test results.

00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:31,280
So that was kind of like original conception for the characters.

00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,660
We want them to look somewhat distinct, so they won't feel like they've been generated.

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,220
We've got some rules for them.

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,960
Even mutants need rules.

00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,880
One or more eyes, two ears, eyebrows, nose, mouth. We planned to add some animations.

00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,020
So it has to be like

00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,720
Well done for the smiles.

00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,400
Hair.

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,200
It's a game about cutting hair.

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,000
And to make things easier for us, we decided to only do no textures, and only do vertex colors.

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,320
Then you have some rules for the game engine.

00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,260
Because after Houdini, we had to import them into the game engine, and set up for the actual game.

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,840
So there are some rules for this.

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:22,880
The main thing that was very important for us was the ability to replace or correct anything

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,000
without exiting VR mode.

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,580
So we basically made the whole level design in VR.

00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,840
And this is how the process of thumbnails work.

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,470
So we import them and then do little pictures of them.

00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,660
In Houdini, you can actually write in Python.

00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:48,680
So in addition to these ready nodes, you can have your own nodes with Python.

00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:54,720
For example, this is the code for a node that puts custom glasses over things

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,160
and those glasses are scaling with the eyes.

00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,830
And you can also write in Vex.

00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:05,240
Vex is like this weird programming or expression language built in Houdini.

00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,880
If you have to write something really, really small, for example, the round nub of the nose

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,300
so your nose can be wider or shorter, this is how you do this.

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,180
This is Vex.

00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,890
You can combine traditional Python, you can combine very easy Vex, and you can also use

00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,720
built-in Houdini nodes.

00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,380
It's a very cool environment for programming because it's very visual.

00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:33,660
So for example, I find it difficult to conceive the whole system of code.

00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,500
But actually, this way I can visualize everything.

00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:46,740
So here is a thing that we wrote in Python for generating the complementary colors.

00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,460
So we don't have to deal with these beautiful palettes.

00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,200
Python did that for us.

00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,800
And here's the time

00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:54,745
(laughter)

00:06:54,745 --> 00:06:57,550
we finally had to generate it.

00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,660
So we set everything up.

00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,210
And then we set up the seeds.

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,040
You see these little dots?

00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,850
Those are like every character.

00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:04,850
Thousands of them.

00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,830
Like, literally thousands in this video.

00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,940
Okay, let's see.

00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,240
As you can see...

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,440
The results are not that spectacular.

00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,660
Not at all exciting or enjoyable.

00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:23,020
In fact, maybe less than 1% resemble something close to the actual living beings.

00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,940
And it was very hard for me to separate good from bad, because in fact

00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,660
this process is the opposite of creation.

00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,840
You curate something and then you have to retire the rest.

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,980
And when I say retire, I don't actually mean they're being sent to Florida to live in a nice condo.

00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,920
No. I'm just erasing them from existence.

00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,340
(laughter)

00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,400
And this is the opposite of creation.

00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,740
And I didn't like this process at all.

00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,240
Unfortunately, I found this wonderful article just a week ago.

00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:59,510
It explains, it outlines all the reasons why generative design is doomed to fail, basically.

00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,920
So we won't have generative buildings in the future or generative anything.

00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,060
Because people are not just, they just don't like that.

00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,980
It just seems very strange and uncanny.

00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,380
And here are some takeaways from our process.

00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:20,080
Quantity doesn't substitute for quality, and becoming a curator is actually very dangerous,

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,740
because curators are biased.

00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,960
They're human beings.

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,319
So when I start curating those "good" ones, they all look the same, basically.

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,450
And they weren't diverse or different at all.

00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,260
So here is the process of fixing our mistakes.

00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,060
First of all, we switched to manual generation.

00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:44,360
We still had a generator, but now you can work it all with your mouse, basically.

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,160
And it was like a big increase in quality, as you can see.

00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,529
Then we started to do some more playtests, and we discovered that people actually liked

00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:56,619
repeated characters more.

00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,069
And every character shouldn't be different.

00:08:59,069 --> 00:09:02,439
They like forming these in-game bonds.

00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:06,550
They enjoyed the predictability of these patterns.

00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,699
We engaged the community into the design.

00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:14,300
We asked them: How can we make the generator better and how can we generate more diverse characters?

00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:19,700
And it was really cool, because people started to design characters that looked like them.

00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:24,740
And we ended up with such widely different creative ways to do it.

00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,740
This is before and after.

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,780
So you can see they helped tremendously.

00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:37,220
The last step that we attempted in fixing our mistakes was adding a MIDI controller.

00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:44,690
This process. To make it more fun, more accessible, and the best part of it -- that you can actually do it

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:49,079
as if you play music, and you can do it together with another person.

00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:50,860
So you can collaborate.

00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,420
This is realtime generation basically.

00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,540
In terms of time, it takes you maybe three or four minutes to make a character.

00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,880
It was still very very fast, and we had not thousands but 200 of them.

00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,480
So this is the slide with the tools and resources, if you want to start it.

00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,980
I bet you all have wonderful programming skills.

00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,180
And you know you can utilize them in Houdini.

00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:19,689
You can program your art and it will be beautiful.

00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:21,549
Most of the tools are free, except Houdini.

00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:26,299
Houdini is also free for non-commercial use, but for commercial use, you can buy it for,

00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,640
I think less than $300.

00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:37,920
So my takeaway is computers are cool and exciting, but once creative, nice, and warm people work together

00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,020
When creative people work together with computers, it's even better.

00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,720
So the last one.

00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,760
This.

00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,760
Give me your cards.

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,809
I will give you keys.

00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:49,960
I can give five.

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,560
Thank you.

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,540
