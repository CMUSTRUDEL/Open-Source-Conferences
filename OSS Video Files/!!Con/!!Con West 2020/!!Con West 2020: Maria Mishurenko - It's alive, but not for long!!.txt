My virtual reality hair-cutting game Bizarre Barber started as a graduate thesis, so I couldn’t afford to hire professional 3D modelers and riggers to help out with character designs. My team decided to employ a procedural pipeline and write a tool that would allow us to generate thousands of characters.

With the help of Houdini, Vex and Python, we set up a generator to make a variety of cute birds and mutants with bold hairstyles and automatically export them to the game engine for further processing.

Sound awesome? Well, little did I know about human biases that would start to emerge when an artist turns into a curator and has to make tough decisions…
