Twelve discounted purses, obsolete Cisco hardware found on eBay, one cube. This talk shows how old stuff, destined to end up in the dump, can be upcycled into something entirely new: a story of reverse engineering unknown modems, dismantling hideous purses, LED driving protocols, designing PCBs on the cheap, some mechanical work, and reprogramming it all into a striking showpiece.
