	CBS Televised Computer-Generated Stories in 1960—and Ten Million Watched! by James Ryan

On October 26th, 1960, CBS-TV aired three computer-generated playlets for a viewing audience of millions. The playlets were produced by SAGA II, a computer program developed by MIT researchers in collaboration with television producers at CBS, for a miniseries called Tomorrow. In this talk, I’ll leverage multiple years of archival research to tell the wild story of the most ambitious early undertaking in computational media, and the remarkable collaboration that made it possible.

James Ryan (@xfoml) is a researcher and practitioner at the intersection of art and computation. His current scholarly focus is in digging up obscure pioneering work in this area, with an emphasis on forgotten early examples of story generation and computer poetry. In 2018 he earned the first PhD in Computational Media from UC Santa Cruz, with his thesis Curating Simulated Storyworlds, and he is now a research scientist based in Minneapolis.

it's 1960 and the MIT Centennial is just

00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:23,050
around the corner CBS notices this and

00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:25,759
decides to celebrate the occasion

00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:28,400
they'll make a television program

00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:31,730
they'll call it tomorrow it will be

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,900
about the future that MIT scientists are

00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:37,820
working to create this is Douglas T Ross

00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,790
professor at MIT

00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:44,830
he's busy coining phrases like computer

00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:48,379
aided design and this is Thomas H Wolfe

00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:50,540
television producer at CBS he's worked

00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:53,080
on shows like see it now with ed Murrow

00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:57,110
but now he's writing and producing

00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:59,030
tomorrow wolf and Roz get lunch in New

00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:01,549
York they're discussing whether

00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:04,699
computer-aided design would make for

00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:07,369
compelling television Ross fears that it

00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:10,580
won't it's too esoteric he tells wolf

00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:14,860
the mood ghost hour the lunch is almost

00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:18,530
over but then wolf pops a wild question

00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:21,650
could a computer write a Western he asks

00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:26,060
the plots are so formulaic he says could

00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:28,610
a computer write a Western Ross thinks

00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,190
about this for the rest of the lunch and

00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:33,650
indeed for the rest of the month before

00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:38,240
finally writing back later with an

00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:40,460
answer yes he says but only if it's a

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,670
pantomime no dialogue

00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:46,370
wolf remains enthused and it would

00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:52,540
appear that a peculiar collaboration

00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:55,909
between CBS and MIT is underway but then

00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:58,159
Claude Shannon for reasons I have not

00:01:55,909 --> 00:02:01,600
been able to determine attempts to

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,479
convince wolf not to go down this path

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:08,569
but ultimately he is unsuccessful

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:11,840
because this is CBS televised computer

00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:15,500
generated stories in 1960 and 10 million

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,959
watched I'm James Ryan this work was

00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,269
done in collaboration with Gillian Smith

00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:22,730
with special assistance from Don Knuth

00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:24,910

organizers shout out to Liza daily no

00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,630
one had ever done anything quite like

00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:42,340
this before in 1952

00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,800
Christopher straight she produced

00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:48,160
computer-generated love letters and in

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,400
59 teo lutz produced computer poetry in

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:54,370
german but this would be the most

00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,100
ambitious undertaking in computational

00:02:54,370 --> 00:03:00,430
media to this time and ross had to

00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:03,190
invent everything from scratch his early

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,410
sketches are remarkably well formed each

00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:08,050
story will take place in a hideout and

00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:11,410
center on a shootout between a robber

00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:14,770
and a sheriff characters will move about

00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:17,350
the world along six places of action the

00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:20,080
corner the table the window the door the

00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:24,510
area outside the door the area outside

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:27,820
the window action will Center on props

00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:32,350
money bags a bottle of whiskey a glass

00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:36,220
and of course the guns each prop affords

00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:38,950
certain actions you can pick up put down

00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:41,410
counts or gloat over the money you can

00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:44,050
pick up put down pour or drink from the

00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:46,900
bottle and glass you can do gun things

00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:51,160
with the guns you can do other things no

00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:54,910
matter what you're holding this is

00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:57,550
Harrison R Morris aka dit graduate

00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:00,220
student at MIT he's gonna lead

00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:03,489
programming on this effort using the TXO

00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:06,010
computer this is the legendary machine

00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:08,200
on which the original hackers the tech

00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:12,340
Model Railroad Club are learning to

00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:14,350
compute at night Morse is working in

00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,810
machine language much of it macro

00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:20,530
generated and he's on a TV production

00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:23,530
schedule he must deliver generated

00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:28,630
screenplays to CBS and six weeks or the

00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:30,460
network will go ballistic source code

00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:33,039
does not survive for this program but

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,260
flowcharts do here's a segment that have

00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:37,360
reconstructed for illustration here it

00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,080
defines how the sheriff will act in the

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,840
world

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,840
at a high level first he enters the

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,030
scene then he goes to the window next he

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,419
calls the look routine which has its own

00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:51,520
segment in the flow charts as a result

00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:55,060
of look he may spot the robber and the

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,789
robber may spot him from here we proceed

00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,889
to what Morse calls a switch this is a

00:04:57,789 --> 00:05:02,319
probabilistic branching point in the

00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:04,599
logic it's what allows the program to

00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:08,020
produce unique stories each time it's

00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:10,870
run to decide which way to branch the

00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,960
program consults a scoring mechanism for

00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:16,120
that switch this takes each of the

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,219
possible branches and scores them

00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,560
according to the state that the world is

00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:23,830
in authors define these scoring

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,509
mechanisms as an example for this switch

00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,419
if the sheriff has spotted the robber

00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:30,219
but not vice versa the advance and other

00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:33,150
branches will be about ten times more

00:05:30,219 --> 00:05:36,400
likely to be taken than the wait branch

00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:38,050
let's say we go this way now we've

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,479
reached a different branch but this time

00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:43,180
it's deterministic basem plea on what's

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,699
in the robbers right hand let's say he's

00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,560
holding a gun which means we proceed to

00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:50,500
another switch which will have its own

00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,050
scoring mechanism from here let's say we

00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,180
go this way now we've reached the shoot

00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:59,800
routine which will have its own segment

00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:02,500
in the flow chart there's three of these

00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,599
flow chart leaves which gives a sense of

00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:08,830
the size of the program which Morris and

00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:11,650
Ross named saga - now one peculiar thing

00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:14,560
about saga - is the level of detail with

00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:16,990
which certain actions are modeled all of

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,089
the logic you see here is simply so that

00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:22,210
a character can empty his hand of an

00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:24,490
object now one cool thing about saga 2

00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:27,159
is the authoring interface that Morse

00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:31,810
made utilizing the flexor writer online

00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:34,539
console at the TXO in an authoring mode

00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:36,879
whenever a switch is reached control of

00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:39,159
the program is temporarily yielded to a

00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:42,159
human author sitting at the flexor

00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:44,529
writer console by typing into the

00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:47,110
console the author can modulate any

00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:49,300
scoring mechanism for any switch thereby

00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,430
changing how the stories look in real

00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,680
time

00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,960
saga 2 is specifically a script

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,120
generating program as it's being

00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,840
executed the Flex a writer prints out

00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,670
line by line a generated script here's

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,940
an excerpt from a script that I found at

00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:08,830
the Computer History Museum

00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:12,070
now Morse didn't have computer memory or

00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:15,010
time to devote to a natural language

00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:16,840
generation module so we had to rely on a

00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:20,170
clever hack for actually producing the

00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:22,870
language here's how it worked at any

00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:25,660
given time step T this story world is in

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:28,060
some state then the next action will

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:31,780
occur sending the world into its next

00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:34,030
state anytime this happens Saga 2 checks

00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,490
for the Delta between these and this

00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:40,110
Delta is rendered in natural language as

00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:43,360
one line of script using simple rules

00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:46,090
right on time six weeks later Morse and

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,880
Ross delivered nine of these computer

00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:52,060
generated scripts to CBS along with

00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,520
Ross's sketches CBS then built a

00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:57,670
physical set from the sketches and cast

00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,610
the talent in the role of Sheriff

00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:03,310
Haywood Hale Brown future sportscaster

00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:06,310
and robber played by Jack Guilford

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:09,190
future Oscar nominee Guilford is

00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,840
particularly spectacular recall the

00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:13,240
level of detail with which object

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,010
handling is modeled in saga 2 and now

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,030
watch Guilford's hands as he performs

00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:20,290
the generated lines at the bottom right

00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:23,650
notice the passing from left hand to

00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:25,570
right and back now one interesting thing

00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:28,420
about saga Tzu is that the more

00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:30,910
characters drink the more erratic their

00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:33,460
behavior becomes this is called the

00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:35,350
inebriation factor and it affects nearly

00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,210
every scoring mechanism producing

00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:40,840
interesting emergent narrative in some

00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:42,970
of the scripts CBS produced three of the

00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,940
generated playlists two of which are

00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:47,950
especially remarkable in the second the

00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:51,100
robber hits the sheriff killing him

00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:52,720
before making off with the cash to my

00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,000
knowledge this is the first time in

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,600
television history that a villain was

00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,850
victorious this is because wolf did not

00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,680
believe that a machine could be held to

00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,710
the strictures of the Hays Commission or

00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,840
FCC regulations on

00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:09,810
could be written for television the

00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:12,420
third playlet is glitch art CBS enacted

00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:15,570
a buggy run of saga Tzu - humorous

00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:18,480
effect in 1960 there were three

00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:21,510
television stations in the u.s. that

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,670
night tomorrow aired on CBS against

00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:25,770
Peter loves Mary and Naked City it

00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:28,970
finished second in the ratings with

00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:31,830
Nielsen estimating 7.7 million audience

00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:33,780
households which allows us to safely

00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:36,270
assume that these computer-generated

00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:39,060
stories were watched by at least 10

00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:41,220
million the next day newspapers ran

00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:44,040
sensationalistic headlines and an

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,530
amazing illustration the reviews were

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,990
generally favorable but one contingent

00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:51,150
was livid at the end of the program
