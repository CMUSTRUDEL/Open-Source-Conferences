of these

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,240
masters who have been working in the

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,280
same shop

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:47,600
for possibly a few decades

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:50,639
and the kind of the attention to the

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,280
the point of repair of technology

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,840
so the aspect of repair and maintenance

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,720
that is

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,400
quite different from the other notion of

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,039
innovation and progress

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:05,840
this linear growth of technology

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,759
it's needless to say that our worlds

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,000
have changed just about now

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,520
due to the coronavirus and then

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,720
everything about the structural

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,440
inequalities

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,320
that we see through the our lived

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,320
experiences

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,440
this conference is for a lot of the

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,360
creative technologists or

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,880
technologists who have very innovative

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,440
approach to

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,560
seeing the world and i want to take this

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,880
opportunity

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,680
to show you where i live and where i

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,080
work

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,039
because i think there's a lot of truth

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,919
to

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,960
the ways in which these masters repair

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,199
technology

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,479
the ways in which they think about the

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,600
act of craft

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:50,320
as much as the techniques and their

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,240
attention to details and their attention

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,280
to details is not just technical it's

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,240
really about

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,840
the commitment to the art form uh

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,880
commitment to the techniques

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,680
of creative expression

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,600
this is a very rare department store

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,560
even in korea and in the u

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,960
in asia there are many other shops um

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,240
that

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,759
deal with technology but i think

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,080
this is unique in a way that these

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,440
masters have been here for years

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,759
and it's located pretty close to

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,240
chun which is an area that does a lot

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,160
more of the physical fabrication

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,280
and urgido which is connected to the

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,680
wholesale

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,199
of you know raw materials and other

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,039
fabrication

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,080
so as i show you this area you see that

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,479
there's a this

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,440
crazy juxtaposition of different art

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,960
forms

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:46,160
and um you know anything ranging from

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:50,639
karaoke automated machines to

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:53,199
horn instruments to pianos and strings

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,160
and i just love this idea of the

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,400
workshop that is exposed to the public

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,680
so you can see that how they approach

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,840
the technology or

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,960
their their instruments is very much

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,160
about their

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,400
process and their philosophy of

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,840
really mastering one types of

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,400
instruments

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,599
and their willingness to fix things if

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,720
things break

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:19,440
and if things just run out of fashion

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,560
it's still welcomed here it's welcomed

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,120
as

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,039
uh you know these objects these tools

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,160
are not discarded easily

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,560
you come here to fix it and you come

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,520
here

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,599
to get it repaired and i think that's

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,599
the what i want to talk about today

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,280
is our commitment to the new types of

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,479
the world that we have

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,199
and how we can be a part of it and as

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,800
you can see

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:47,039
that i'm still wearing a mask and

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,720
you know things are quite calm here in

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,680
south korea compared to

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,639
other parts of the world however i'm

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,400
very cautious

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,400
about you know the social distancing and

00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,599
they're kind of the gatherings that i

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,639
could go to

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,000
uh it's okay to go to the public now the

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,039
shops are open

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,520
uh restaurants are open in korea and

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,319
things are coming back to uh more more

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,720
or less

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,319
like what it was before but i know that

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,800
it's not the same in other parts of the

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,160
world

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,160
and um i am really mindful of the

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,360
sacrifices that other people have made

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,479
for our

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,360
you know ability to move around in in

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,120
seoul so i'm very careful about that but

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,479
i also think this opportunity with the

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,039
bang bang con is an

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,640
ex it's like a perfect chance to show

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,200
you where it came from

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,000
um and the kind of the relationship with

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,800
tech

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
spaces poetry and art that we have here

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,640
that's different from

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,360
new york or any other parts wherever you

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,519
are

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:55,040
so let me show you the exterior of the

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:57,519
nagwan's hangar

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,680
yeah they say this was like the first

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,800
department store that was built

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,320
that's a mix of uh residential and also

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,480
commercial

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,839
and you see a lot of old people hanging

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,839
out there

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,760
and i'll see you soon

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:21,279
so i just walked from the store to

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,120
insadong which is an area that's

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,279
pretty popular among the tourists

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,560
because they have this traditional

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:33,920
shops here a lot of restaurants

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:36,640
this particular shop is an old book shop

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,640
and you can find old dictionaries

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:42,320
artworks

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:45,920
photos of artists from the past

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,839
map of this area i believe i'm a little

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,680
intimidated to go inside

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,200
because it's like a really serious shot

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,760
but i think you see

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,200
this organization of archives and

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,279
documents from the past

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,880
but the guy's just like staring at me so

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:04,800
i'm just gonna walk away

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:08,000
but uh yeah

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,120
and speaking of which

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,959
so i'm delighted to find out that

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,800
a bunch of people on the internet

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,839
thought the bang bang con was about the

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,519
bts

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:22,240
which is one of the top um

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,360
here they are entertainers that came out

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,360
of korea

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,680
so i believe it's just these seven

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,959
really talented young men

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,360
who are really good at singing dancing

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,399
and just entertaining and i'm really

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,519
curious to

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,800
engage with like that fandom and like

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,519
that fan group

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,480
to talk about technology identity

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,360
intimacy

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,079
and notion of care because the one of

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,200
the reasons that

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:52,560
bts is so popular is that they

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:56,079
are not so much about putting up this uh

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:59,040
image of a completely independent

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,079
like you know macho identity they're

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,640
much more about

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:05,360
uh being cool about like their

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,440
insecurities their vulnerabilities

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,680
um their fears and their you know

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,800
they're quite transparent about that

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,399
and i think that's new so i think that

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,320
speaks to a lot of the younger

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,560
generation who feel like

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,160
internet is not really a safe space and

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,920
like they didn't really see themselves

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,760
reflected in in the media but the bts

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,120
songs and their lyrics

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,120
are all about that kind of intimacy

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,360
so i'm really curious about that i want

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,000
to ask them why they love this group so

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,680
much

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,880
and what makes them different from other

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,880
groups that are just around

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:46,640
hey y'all now i am in hongdae

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,519
area which is a very popular college

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,760
town

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,560
quite well known for its bars

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,240
restaurants

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,639
clubs and the art scene then you can see

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,200
a

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,360
really beautiful moon out there let's

00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,360
see

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,120
so i used to spend some time here before

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,760
i moved to new york

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,839
i think i had a studio here for a while

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,600
no it's more like my friends have studio

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,959
here so i'll just come out

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:25,839
and hang out with them here's a really

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:25,839
cool cart

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,680
yeah this used to be much more

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,399
residential and a lot of

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,200
artists run spaces that are quite

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,200
experimental

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,440
it became a very popular hang zone

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:46,639
probably around 10 years ago and it

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,639
sort of became a um

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:54,000
mostly entertainment area

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,680
i'm like one of those like old people

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,079
that talk about the good old days when

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,160
this

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,440
you know like the area used to be much

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,560
more authentic

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,839
that's not a very fun story i think this

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,720
is where like

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,880
one of the oldest like um artist run

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,839
gallery used to be at

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,079
right here went to a lot of parties

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,079
there

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,000
it's so interesting that now like people

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,240
are not so

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
surprised by people walking around with

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,959
like their phones and like recording

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,680
stuff

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,079
and i think this used to be pretty

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,079
different

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:37,200
look at all these cell phone accessories

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,200
all you can ever want

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,560
i think i'm gonna try to find a cute

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,120
cafe to sit

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,600
and write for a little bit i just had a

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:52,639
dinner with some friends at a gallery

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,639
and took the subway to come here

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,519
and i got a gimbal so i'm gonna charge

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,519
that up and let's see if i could use it

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,760
so i'm crossing this bridge this used to

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:09,920
be

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:12,160
this used to be a train track

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,560
and it was a little abandoned over here

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,480
but it's quite nice to see it developed

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,480
into this park there used to be a really

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,240
cute bookstore

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:31,839
at the top of that building the pointy

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:34,639
building i think it's something else now

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,639
yeah this is a really special area for

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,040
me and many other artists who spent some

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,519
time

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,519
in seoul

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,839
we see the sun set

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:55,120
and i'm gonna go to this tiny cafe

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:59,120
and have some tea and write my talk for

00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:01,839
bang bang khan

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,480
hey so i was sitting at a really cute

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,720
cafe

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,800
called sukhara that does really good

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,120
vegan cooking

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,800
i didn't take any videos in respect of

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,680
the privacy of the people who work there

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,760
and then other

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:18,480
clients i didn't think about my identity

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,760
and how the quarantine experience has

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,839
changed

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,360
how i see myself and the world i was

00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:27,839
self-isolated in brooklyn in my

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,959
apartment for about a month and a half

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,440
um i had a pretty severe symptom

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,720
that i believe was covered i had a

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,320
hardness of breath

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,639
and other pain i couldn't get tested

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,320
so i just you know lived through it i

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,199
got a lot of help from friends

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,240
um and strangers who just offered so

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,399
generously

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,360
to bring me food and you know check up

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,279
on me

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,040
but it was also a very isolating

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,399
experience i live alone

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:59,279
and i don't have any family members in

00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,959
new york or the united states and i can

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,680
imagine that a lot of the audience for

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,399
this talk

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,680
are going through something similar

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,040
physical pain

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:12,160
was difficult but it was essentially the

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:15,680
uh isolation and the

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:18,079
the sense of uh you know

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,199
kind of being cut off from the world

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,759
this

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,959
idea that the social distancing became

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,839
physical distancing

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:29,920
that became emotional distancing

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,680
i think this is a really hard time for a

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,920
lot of us and

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,519
i do want to check up on like this

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,440
notion of

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,639
you know the identities that we are

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,000
enforced

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:45,600
from birth so growing up in south korea

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,959
which is a very heteronormative space

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,279
i didn't have a lot of chance to think

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,519
about my gender or my identities until

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:54,000
when i was older

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,880
and i didn't know that a lot of us could

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,720
have many

00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,639
uh gender identities inside of us

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,079
it was quite common to hear like you

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,959
know why are you a man

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,360
who act like that why are you a woman

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,720
who

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:11,039
acts like that it's quite easy to say

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,480
such such things but it's actually

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:16,319
enforcing

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:19,199
gender normativity and that leads to

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,919
possibly a toxic relationship with your

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,039
own gender

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,880
or other people's gender

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,360
many people in these societies are

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,320
assigned one or the other

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,039
gender when we're birth so like men are

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,280
expected to

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,440
have masculinity and women are expected

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,640
to have femininity

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,039
and in our homes workplaces

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:46,559
schools we are expected to perform those

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:49,600
binary gender roles

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:52,000
but i think that's not fair

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,799
just like there are so many numbers

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,280
between zeros and one

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,880
and oftentimes those spaces those

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,080
numbers are the most beautiful things

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,440
that we can

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,360
find in this world there's many gender

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,400
roles many identities

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:13,039
many personalities between ourselves and

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,960
each other if the quarantine experience

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,880
of being isolated

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,640
is something that we cannot avoid and

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,799
something that we should respect

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,080
i wonder if there's a way to for us to

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,960
unpack this

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,600
heteronormative um kind of toxic

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,080
approach

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,200
of you know binary gender or binary

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,120
identities

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,919
for example this could expand to this

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,880
notion of nationalities or ethnicities

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,320
like are you just the one nationality or

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,640
are you multiple

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,760
and it could also be your trade like are

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,640
you a technologist

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,600
or social justice activist or both so

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,960
these are not

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,880
exclusive but i think

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,960
you know in the world that we have lived

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,440
before the coronavirus

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,640
the world in which that was very fast

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,919
and the

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:02,640
one that focused on growth

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,960
i think we had not a lot of choice but

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,280
to

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,880
think of ourselves as one or the other

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,960
so zero and one

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,000
but i wonder if we can think about

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,080
everything

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,240
in between that everything between black

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:18,160
and white meaning like the

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:20,080
black being you know zero and then

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,360
white being one if we're to compare the

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:26,799
binary information to grayscale

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:29,600
and also between men and women

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:32,080
and i'm just so fascinated and like

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,280
inspired by the genderqueer movements

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,960
um lgbtq friends that i work with and

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,080
and hang out with

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,480
and i think we have a lot to learn from

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,840
them

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,640
um particularly thinking about bufu

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,559
which is a

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,760
collective that does really amazing

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,760
organizing

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,679
press press baltimore it's another

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,600
collective that i look up to

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,840
a yellow jackets collective and

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,799
i think the tech spaces have a lot to

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,320
learn from

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:05,440
community organizing as such i

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,159
just will say that even the diversity

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,640
initiative

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,880
in the tech world seems to be pretty

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,720
heteronormative about like

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,000
what they're thinking in terms of

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,360
representation and

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,840
equity so how can we clear the tech

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,200
spaces how can we think about different

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,960
kinds of equities in

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:28,159
learning and also developing

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,840
these new modes for ourselves and i

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,440
want to ask all of you to think about

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,640
that because i think that's essentially

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,840
related to

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,480
care repair and maintenance so

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,120
ourselves as a machine like our bodies

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,159
and our

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,320
uh you know mind as this you know

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,760
uh some something that we need to take

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,919
care of

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,559
and perhaps our bodies and our

00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:53,600
identities are not such so binary as we

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,600
might have thought before

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:02,559
hey so i'm

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,600
in my family home and it's about 9 00

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,400
a.m

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,880
and i'm just getting ready to write this

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,960
talk

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,480
that i have been meaning to write for

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,200
such a long time

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,720
and i just want to say how much i love

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,679
conferences

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,440
i really like boxed coffees or like

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,600
coffees that come in this big

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,880
plastic bins that you can just like pour

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,840
out and i'm having

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,840
having some coffee now

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,799
i love name tags like i love writing on

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,919
it i love reading other people's names

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,159
and like their

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,760
preferred gender pronouns what they're

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,600
interested in

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,520
i love like pastries that are a little

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,120
bit old and stale but like still

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,720
good and like you just want to like have

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,880
a lot of them

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,039
i love giving talks in front of audience

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,440
i love watching talks

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,720
and mostly i just love like meeting new

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,919
people

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,320
and the coronavirus has really

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,320
changed how we interact with each other

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,679
and how we think about physical spaces

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:04,400
and convenings in real life it's really

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,039
difficult to have that kind of a

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,919
intimate

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,200
relationship just over these video

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,679
conferences

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,280
but i think we are trying to do our best

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,200
and i think we're learning a lot about

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,520
ourselves and our spaces

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,520
and how we relate to each other

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,720
digitally and physically over this

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,159
experience

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,840
so i'm gonna try to give you a little

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,520
bit of tour of my studio

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,240
what i'm working on and what i'm

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,240
thinking about

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,320
so there's a tiny birds up in this pine

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:46,799
tree

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,799
and here are some of the peonies

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,760
and this is where i study math

00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,880
so this is a really old book i think

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:04,640
about like 40 years old

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,640
classic math textbook

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,559
i was actually looking into how

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,799
exponential

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,080
functions would work especially in

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,400
relation to graph

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,400
that we have been seeing because of the

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,400
coronavirus

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,240
i realize that including myself most

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,360
people don't really understand how

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,799
these logarithmic graphs work and how

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,120
important it is to understand

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,720
the relationship between numbers so not

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,600
only the absolute values but the

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,600
relationships

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,200
and i was thinking about how much i

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,200
hated math growing up

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,799
and i was really bad at it it turns out

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:48,480
that i was mostly hating the math class

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:52,000
and a little bit about how the teachers

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,240
would you know deal with students like

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,240
me who are just not good at math

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,279
so i realized it wasn't the math itself

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:02,000
but the act of learning math

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,520
so i started to relearn math on my own

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,760
terms

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,080
and we have this magical world of

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,720
numbers

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,679
the world consists of different data

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,360
some of which

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:19,120
are human very relatable

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,919
like this clock some of which are just

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,120
logistics

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:33,840
of having to you know manage your life

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:33,840
these are just my to-do lists

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,279
and i was thinking about this word which

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,559
is a korean word based on chinese

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,880
character

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,480
and i looked it up and there are so many

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,200
definitions

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,720
in my understanding it's like a texture

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,720
of a network

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,320
like the fabric of a network but it

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,840
could also mean a mess

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:58,240
not invent prevent

00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,240
clot

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:04,799
so what is the network of math or the

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,799
numbers

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,559
here i'm trying to understand inverse

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,799
function

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,000
and it's kind of like there's a person

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,200
at the top and then the person at the

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,960
bottom they're kind of like

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,440
speaking to each other in this reverse

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,440
function

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,120
and i have a friend named jenny odell

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,919
who wrote a book called how to do

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,080
nothing

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,200
which i which i highly recommend to

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,240
people who

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,840
are having trouble doing nothing and we

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,279
talked a lot about birds

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,720
and sound and spaces and

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,480
one of the key takeaway from our

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,120
conversation is that

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,520
you know the time is malleable like time

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,720
or

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,360
this quantified sense of time passing

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,200
is quite subjective and how we think

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,919
about time depends on how we think about

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,039
space

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:57,600
and our relationships to our habitat so

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,400
for her noticing the birds the sounds of

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,400
the birds

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,200
is a way of reconnecting with herself

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,200
and in the world

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,880
for me it's been a lot about farming so

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,880
here is my

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:13,200
little lettuce farm

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,360
and i learned i knew a little bit about

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,799
farming before just growing up but

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,480
i haven't really done it in a while

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,840
living in new york i just didn't have

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,279
the space

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,480
so i've been trying to reconnect with

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:28,159
the earth and thinking about the compost

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:31,200
and the life around me

00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:35,200
there's a really famous uh philosopher

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,880
um her name is donna haraway

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,880
she's quite well known for cyborg

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,480
manifesto and etc

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,200
and recently she's been writing a lot

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:47,039
about compost and then the critters

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:50,320
of the world the hard values of the math

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,960
meaning like this math as this absolute

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,640
truth

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,240
of the data i wonder if there's a way we

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,360
can think about the magic

00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:03,120
of numbers including how compost is

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:06,159
essentially a magic like you have this

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:09,600
you know soil and you have these natural

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,600
elements that are you know

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,200
sort of coming from the animals and

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,440
other parts

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,320
and how we can think about these

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,440
varieties

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:22,240
of beings as the part of the magical

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,120
you know world so there are the natural

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,600
numbers

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,640
the whole numbers integers and rational

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,720
numbers

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,399
all of these are quite different so in

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:34,559
my farm there are lettuce

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:36,240
the compost and there's a tiny pond and

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,640
not sure if you can see but those are

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,399
the tiny mosquitoes

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,919
you know like i hate mosquitoes as much

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,600
as anybody else

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,520
but it's also like i acknowledge that

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,720
their existence so

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,279
um i am really debating about what to do

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,880
with these

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:54,000
tiny tiny mosquitoes um part of me wants

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,919
to get rid of them

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,559
and part of me wants to just like let

00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,679
them be um that's a conversation that i

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:03,840
need to have with my

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,840
rest of the farm team which are here

00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,840
