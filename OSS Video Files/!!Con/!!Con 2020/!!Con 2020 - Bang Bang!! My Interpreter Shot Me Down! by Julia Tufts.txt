	Bang Bang!! My Interpreter Shot Me Down! by Julia Tufts

How does a JavaScript object feel when it’s hit with a !! operator? In this musical ballad, we’ll look at what a !! operator does at a high level and how it can be useful. Then we’ll explore what it does at a lower level, from the perspective of an object seething with resentment. We’ll discover how a !! is parsed and interpreted in V8, by following a multifaceted object’s descent into boolean reduction.
