	Learning your 爱比西s: Translating Chinese into Morse code! by Franklin Hu

How do you translate Chinese into Morse code?

In the late 1800s, China was connected to the international telegraph network, and this was the big question! Morse code was originally conceived for transmitting English, and while it was extended to support other alphabetic languages, this didn’t work out of the box for character-based languages like Chinese.

In this talk, we’ll walk through the different encoding schemes used to convert characters to Morse code, their tradeoffs, and how some of the challenges are relevant to us still today!

Franklin writes software for a living and enjoys taking pictures of birds in museums, practicing Danish and Chinese, and shaving yaks (not literally).
