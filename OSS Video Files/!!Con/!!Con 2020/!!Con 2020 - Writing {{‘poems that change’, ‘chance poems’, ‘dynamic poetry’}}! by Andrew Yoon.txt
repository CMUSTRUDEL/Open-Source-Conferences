Description: 
	Writing {{‘poems that change’, ‘chance poems’, ‘dynamic poetry’}}! by Andrew Yoon

Roses are red, violets are—purple? Blue? Why not both! {{‘The Blur Markup Language’, ‘BML’}} allows {{‘writers’, ‘authors’}} to {{‘make’, ‘write’}} text which is lazily evaluated, freeing them from the {{‘requirement’, ‘assumption’}} that their words have to exist in any one {{‘static’, ‘fixed’}} form. Unlike more open-ended text generation approaches, BML allows the creation of {{‘tightly’, ‘precisely’}} composed texts rich with surprises and possibilities. We’ll explore the motivations behind chance poetry{{‘ and BML,’, ‘’}} and see how it’s being used in {{‘the wild’, ‘action’}} from books to essays to installations.

Andrew Yoon is making poems that change, live coding noise, playing melodica, growing the art journal nothing-to-say.org, and advocating for copyright abolition. He can be found online at andrewyoon.art

horray well hi i'm andrew and i'm really

00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:26,449
indecisive normally that's okay since it

00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:28,579
just affects me and my personal

00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:31,250
development and my ability to watch

00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:34,129
movies but unfortunately i'm also a

00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,170
writer and the thing about writing is

00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:39,860
that you're always making decisions

00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:41,420
every word you choose every line break

00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,140
you insert every little bit of

00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,100
punctuation

00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:47,540
it's just countless decisions and

00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:51,610
through all of these decisions there's a

00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:54,589
lot of pressure to make the right one

00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:56,659
every time you pick a word it's it's

00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:57,949
there's all of these wrong choices to

00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:59,269
make and there's one right choice to

00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:01,760
make and you're expected to find the

00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:05,330
right choice and I don't necessarily

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,830
believe that right choice exists and it

00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:10,580
to be honest makes me uncomfortable

00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:12,619
having to choose a word because I I feel

00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,909
guilty leaving out all the other words

00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:15,200
because they were perfectly fine they

00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:19,520
didn't do anything wrong they deserve to

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:23,630
have their time of day so I want to find

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:26,330
a way to not exclude them so I made a

00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:29,360
thing this thing is called BML or the

00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:33,490
blur markup language it's a programming

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,990
language for writing text that changes

00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:38,659
rather than writing exactly what you

00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:41,060
want people to read you express the

00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:44,560
possibilities and these are then chosen

00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:47,000
for you on demand so here we have a

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,800
basic summary of what the language is

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,030
and a bunch of different ways to write

00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,909
it out like we can spell B in the

00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,680
lowercase as I prefer or uppercase or

00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:56,570
you can fully spell out the acronym and

00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,370
then we can describe it as make its

00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:00,650
light weight or hacky all these

00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:02,030
different things that can happen and you

00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,030
can see five different ways that it's

00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:06,920
been realized below and hopefully you

00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,629
can kind of see that all of the details

00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,150
change and the number of permutations

00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:15,799
that could occur here is really quite

00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:17,540
large on but at the same time the shape

00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:20,719
of it the meaning behind the text

00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:23,090
somehow stays the same so let's talk

00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,829
about the language a little bit in line

00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,900
choices we have these and you've already

00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:27,580
seen these so

00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,260
this is just listing a bunch of

00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,640
different things that can happen and we

00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,530
can assign different weights to them so

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,750
in this case we're doing a B and C a a

00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,760
is going to happen 50% of the time B is

00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,260
going to happen 30% of the time and then

00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,750
C is going to take up whatever remaining

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,519
probability we have and below in all

00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,760
these examples you kind of see a

00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:49,720
rendition of this this code a couple of

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:52,060
different times so we have C a a a B we

00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,790
can also apply rules over larger swaths

00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,590
of text so in this case we're taking the

00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,090
word and and we're looking for it

00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,579
everywhere and every time we encounter

00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:04,569
that we might use the word and or we

00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:06,489
might insert an ampersand instead we can

00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:09,400
also do more complicated things like

00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:10,629
running arbitrary JavaScript in this

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,640
case we're using a regular expression

00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:16,030
matching that's just looking for the

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,940
first letter of words and it's going to

00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:20,500
then capitalize that and we've run this

00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,599
a few times over this really lovely

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,670
quote by John Cage I have nothing to say

00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:26,950
and I'm saying it and that is poetry as

00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,450
I need it and the different

00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:31,000
capitalizations that occur kind of

00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:33,790
applied different weights into the text

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,500
and shape the sentence in different ways

00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,049
and highlight different thoughts and I

00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,579
think that's really interesting it can

00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:41,379
do a bunch of other things so we have a

00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:43,359
standard library of common functions

00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:44,530
standard library it's actually like

00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:46,510
three functions but they're they're

00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,480
useful things to have around that are

00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:51,519
then available inside the eval API we

00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,769
can call inline function calls we can do

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,349
markdown rendering we can escape blocks

00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:58,449
and have literal text blocks and we can

00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:02,290
also reproducibly generate the same text

00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:04,090
by pinning a seed and it also works at a

00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,569
browser so you can put it in your

00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:09,910
websites in terms of how it's actually

00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:12,790
built it's just a bunch of bad

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:15,069
JavaScript and truly evil uses of the

00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:18,280
eval command and we're not going to talk

00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:23,590
about it so some of the things that I've

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:25,479
done with UML this is a an excerpt from

00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,160
the source of a dynamic poem I made and

00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:29,169
you can see the number of chance

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,510
elements and permutations starts to

00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:34,030
become very high very quickly but at the

00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:36,520
same time again the larger structural

00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:39,180
ideas can retain their shape if that's

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:42,080
something that you want and you can see

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:45,060
here's a rendition of that poem in full

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,370
I'm not gonna pause and dwell on it too

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:51,930
much but you can go back if you like and

00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:55,020
check it out more this was installed

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:57,740
well so this is a contraption I made

00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:00,300
that I endearingly called the poetron

00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,160
it's just a box with the receipt printer

00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,570
and a big glowing button and when you

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,729
press the button it generates a poem

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:09,930
using BML and prints it on a receipt for

00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:12,479
you to take home I installed this in a

00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:15,870
gallery cj1 gallery in New York City in

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,910
February I think and I think visitors

00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,889
had a lot of fun coming by and pressing

00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:22,259
the button and printing out versions of

00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:26,280
that poem we were just looking at it and

00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:28,259
taking it home with them also because

00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,509
it's embeddable on websites I've made

00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:31,830
blog post with this and kind of covertly

00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:34,410
just publish them as if they were well

00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,820
behaved blogs but in fact the text does

00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:41,160
change every time you refresh the page

00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:42,900
and really excitingly I'll be publishing

00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,380
a full length book of chance poetry with

00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:48,150
us press in 2021 we'll be publishing one

00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,460
or a couple physical versions of the

00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:52,380
book while simultaneously publishing it

00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,389
online where visitors will be able to

00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,490
explore the gazillion different versions

00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:57,810
of the poems and they'll be able to kind

00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,190
of discover different versions of the

00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,780
poems and share them with other people

00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,539
it's going to be a lot of fun I'm super

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:06,449
excited about this and just for kicks

00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:08,280
this presentation also is generated with

00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,449
BML and as I speak right now this is the

00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,180
first time I'm seeing this presentation

00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:14,460
I and I can show you the source here

00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,050
so like one fun thing we're doing is

00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,150
every time we have an exclamation mark

00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:21,240
we've repeated some arbitrary number of

00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:26,460
times and that's much it just like stuff

00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:27,770
that's going on here well Lord seriously

00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:31,950
why why is this interesting

00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:34,170
I think dynamic

00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:37,020
makes the reading experience more

00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:40,710
intimate and invites a more critical

00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:42,930
mode of reading maybe by reading several

00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,730
versions of the same text the reader can

00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:49,530
come closer to the underlying thoughts

00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:52,080
of the writer at the same time it's kind

00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:55,350
of a trope that writing is already a

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,750
process of self-discovery but as a

00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:00,660
writer interacting with this medium I

00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:03,360
found surprising and rewarding feedback

00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:06,330
loop between me and the text that comes

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,400
out of this seeing my words scrambled

00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:10,560
and rearranged and really out of my

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,570
hands in some sense has radically

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,450
changed the way that I write and think

00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:17,550
about text and my own style

00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:18,960
and like I mentioned at the beginning

00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:22,110
here I think this calls into question

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,820
the idea of the author and the

00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:26,130
assumption that there exists a correct

00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:30,000
text that there exists a best way to

00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:31,860
make a thing and at the same time that

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,230
it challenges authorship I think a

00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:37,040
challenge is ownership a question I'd

00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:40,290
like to leave you all with here today is

00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:46,260
what does it mean to own a text that

00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:48,450
nobody wrote thank you so much you can

00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:52,620
find out more about this language at

00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:54,780
Laing org that's BML lang org you can

00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:58,340
find me online at Andrew and art and I'd

00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,340
