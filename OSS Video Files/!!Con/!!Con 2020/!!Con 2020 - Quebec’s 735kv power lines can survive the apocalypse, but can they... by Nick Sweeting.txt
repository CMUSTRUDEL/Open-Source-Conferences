Description: 
	Quebec’s 735kv power lines can survive the apocalypse, but can they run TCP?! by Nick Sweeting

Quebec built the world’s first 735 kV power line in 1965, and was the highest-voltage, longest-distance network for decades before the rest of the world caught up. Even today it’s still seen as ““bomb-proof”” by the rest of the world, and is often used as a model. But it wasn’t always that way…

When a massive ice storm took down 36,000 power pylons overnight in 1998, Quebec had to rebuild and restart their power grid from the ground up. Let’s do some failure analysis and learn how big power systems around the world are designed to fail gracefully, and what happens when they don’t. (P.S. TCP over power lines totally works)

Nick Sweeting is the co-founder of Monadical in Montreal, and his favorite bike paths all run under power lines. He’s a Django developer by day, and rogue internet archivist / power grid investigator by night. He likes learning about how big systems fail, and thinks thyristor halls look neat.

hi friends I'm super excited to tell you

00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:20,510
all about my latest favorite passion

00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:23,180
Kopacz Peregrine's because it's

00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:25,190
surprisingly indestructible but it

00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:27,140
wasn't although always that way so I

00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,660
want to start with a story or rather

00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,939
three stories of times that this massive

00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,760
system has failed

00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:36,890
so when Quebec originally designed their

00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,390
power grid they knew that it was a snowy

00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,670
province and they knew that they'd have

00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:44,270
ice storms so they engineered it so that

00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:46,250
every exposed surface could withstand an

00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:48,590
inch or so at one point two inches of

00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,630
ice buildup everywhere so that means

00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,580
every wire every pylon everything could

00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:56,480
be coated in a full inch of ice buildup

00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:58,700
before their system would fail of course

00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,780
that didn't last so long so in 1961 they

00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,950
had an ice storm that knocked everything

00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,570
out and then they up they upped the

00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:04,850
reading to one point even inches and

00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,140
then of course in 1986 it happened yet

00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:09,710
again knocked the whole system out and

00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:11,750
they upped their rating again so finally

00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,159
they got fed up of everything getting

00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,759
knocked down and they they built two

00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:18,890
widths and I believe 1.8 inches which

00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:22,899
was way higher than anything else in the

00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:25,429
world for context even Alaska or Siberia

00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:27,350
didn't have ratings this high in

00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:29,990
particular because Quebec's snowfall in

00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:32,179
certain areas is very high and then of

00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:34,100
course in 1998 the big one happened the

00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:36,200
famous ice storm that knocked out the

00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,450
entire power grid yet again and it was

00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,289
due to 2.8 inches of solid ice build up

00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:44,840
on every exposed surface 17,000 plus

00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:46,819
power poles had to be replaced thousands

00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,170
of kilometres of lines and of course

00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:49,759
millions of people didn't have power and

00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,130
it was so bad that they had to send

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,439
electrical repair crews from North

00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,389
Carolina and South Carolina up to Quebec

00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:58,939
to help fix the system and it took weeks

00:01:56,389 --> 00:02:02,270
for them to rebuild and they learned a

00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:04,999
lot of lessons since then so for context

00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:08,300
in Quebec all of the power comes from a

00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:11,030
small region in the Northwest area of

00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:13,640
Quebec in the James Bay and it's called

00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:16,670
the James Bay project and they set up

00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,350
several dams in the 1970s and then

00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,750
long-distance transmission lines from

00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,879
those dams to cities and the reason why

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:26,300
this is interesting is because Quebec

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,370
was the first country or a region ever

00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:31,190
to do really long distance high-voltage

00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:34,880
transmission lines so Quebec pioneered

00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:36,590
the first 735 kilovolt lines and at the

00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,330
time the the highest lines in the world

00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:42,050
were at three hundred kilovolts so they

00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:43,340
they over doubled the voltage rating so

00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,490
that they could get really really hot

00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,020
long distances at high efficiency and

00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:50,270
Quebec today runs on over ninety percent

00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,980
hydroelectric power and mostly from

00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:54,320
those dams and that power goes all the

00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,780
way down from those dams into the cities

00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,200
and even down to New York City they sell

00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:02,590
a lot of power into the u.s. so a quick

00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,160
overview of the James Bay project it's

00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,290
incredible it's the largest

00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,650
hydroelectric installation in the world

00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:12,710
at 27 gigawatts of maximum capacity is

00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:15,250
huge and it went out against proposals

00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:18,080
for nuclear power back in the 1970s

00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:20,930
unfortunately it had a huge cost so they

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,020
had to flood almost 13,000 kilometers of

00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:25,700
land eleven point five thousand

00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:28,760
kilometers of which was owned by a Cree

00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,110
and Inuit native populations so they

00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,450
gave those native populations

00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:34,820
populations 250 million in exchange for

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,830
that land and in the process created the

00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,870
largest body of water ever made by

00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:42,980
humankind and is now the fresh largest

00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:44,810
freshwater lake in Canada so it's it's

00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:48,050
as I mentioned it's all those mega dams

00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:50,989
near the Arctic Circle that are holding

00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:52,400
back this flooded area and then slowly

00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:54,050
releasing it over time to generate

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,239
hydroelectric power and of course

00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:58,250
because Quebec is separatist at its core

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,500
it's a it's an entirely separate grid

00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,540
from the rest of North America North

00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,340
America has five grid regions and Texas

00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,150
and Quebec are both independent separate

00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,320
from the rest of the major grid regions

00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,970
this is what it looks like in the summer

00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,730
this is called the giant it's caused way

00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:16,609
because these huge steps are the

00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:18,530
spillway for the dam and then this is

00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:20,299
what it looks like in winter most of the

00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:22,550
year I'm sorry I couldn't find a higher

00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:26,450
resolution photos that were that were

00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:30,110
public tree to use so how do power grids

00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:32,990
work it turns out coming out of your

00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,450
wall you have single-phase AC so in the

00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:38,770
US that's 110 volts and it looks like a

00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:40,389
sine wave so if you plug in a voltage

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:43,870
or an oscilloscope into the wall you'll

00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:45,580
see one nice clean sine wave 60 Hertz so

00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,159
60 times per second is going above and

00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:52,690
60 times per second is going below zero

00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:54,610
volts and the reason why we use AC is

00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,009
because Tesla one if you like the Tesla

00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,659
and Edison Moore's it turns out that AC

00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:00,729
is easier to convert between high

00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:02,949
voltage and low voltage than DC and

00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:05,229
that's because transformers rely on AC

00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:08,110
because you need a change in electric

00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:10,180
field for a transformer to work so

00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,880
old-school power grids ran entirely on

00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:15,400
transformers and fuses or breakers and

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,710
regions would be connected and you'd

00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,530
have big long distance wires at very

00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,210
high voltage and then local wires at

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,460
lower voltage with transformers going

00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,900
between the two modern systems are a lot

00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,490
more advanced than that we have

00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,979
capacitors we have thyristors we have

00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,990
optic coupling of like digital control

00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:34,210
systems because when you have such high

00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,039
voltages you can't just like plug in

00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,569
Arduino into a relay and turn them on

00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:39,580
and off right it'll fry the whole thing

00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:41,800
so you have to use fiber optics to

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,659
couple the signals for the control

00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,759
circuitry so that you don't accidentally

00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:48,610
zap whatever it is that's deciding when

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,680
to turn power on and off the other major

00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:53,860
issue that power grids deal with is a

00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,909
changing load so over time throughout

00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,430
the day throughout the month throughout

00:05:54,909 --> 00:06:00,099
the year the load on the electrical grid

00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:02,529
varies wildly and a lot of the job of

00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:04,810
electrical operators is to respond to

00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:07,750
that those changes in load quickly and

00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:09,190
also respond to the economy of how power

00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,990
is sold and bought

00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:12,520
so when power is cheap in a certain

00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,870
region and it makes sense to ship it

00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,909
over very long distance to a more

00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:18,370
expensive region but other times it may

00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:20,110
not make sense to do that so a lot of

00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,319
the job of people operate power plants

00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,940
and power grids is balancing the

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,029
frequencies and the phases of the power

00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:29,680
system to make sure that it all stays

00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:30,789
operative and that we're not lagging and

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,930
what I mean by frequency synchronization

00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:37,300
is that when you think of a power grid

00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:39,699
think of big spinning wheels big fly

00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,430
wheels inside of power generating plants

00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:45,550
that are really heavy and that spinning

00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:47,440
kinetic energy is actually one of the

00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:49,300
major safety systems in a power grid so

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,009
if the power were to go out where if a

00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,390
sudden spike were to happen where a lot

00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:55,330
of load is placed on the system at once

00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:56,950
all together in sync all of the power

00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,210
grids and all of the power generation

00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,980
plants in that region will start

00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,780
spinning slower because you're pulling

00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,790
energy kinetic energy out of the wheels

00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:06,280
and turning it into electrical energy so

00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,990
managing that kinetic energy and making

00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,870
sure the wheels all stay spinning at the

00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,550
same rate and all together in sync is

00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:15,340
super important and it's one of the

00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:18,760
hardest things and to make it even more

00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:20,830
complicated measuring the system is very

00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:25,500
very different than measuring some

00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:28,030
microelectronics so they use tools like

00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,530
I'm blanking on the name but there's one

00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:32,110
tool in particular that it's really cool

00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:34,060
where you can bounce a signal off of the

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:36,160
end of a transmission wire and watch it

00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,690
come back and measure how long the

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,850
transmission wire is and if there are

00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,710
any faults in between because any change

00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:43,660
in impedance in the wire will cause a

00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,980
reflection and signal in the same way

00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,510
that waves bounce off the end of the

00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,550
pool signals bounce off the end of a

00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:50,560
wire so they'll often send signals down

00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:53,140
wires to see where did the wire go down

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,370
and it's like Oh at kilometer 236 and

00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,340
then they send out a car or a helicopter

00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:59,740
and they replace that one part another

00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,720
major issue is that the whole grid is

00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,760
actually a giant antenna so any signals

00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,410
that you put over the wires end up

00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:09,220
reading out into space and I'll get back

00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:11,110
to that a little bit later so we talked

00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,600
about AC we have three phase AC powering

00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:18,130
most of the system and that's because

00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:20,260
Tesla won the the current Wars but DC is

00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:23,560
making a comeback so these days high

00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:26,740
voltage DC is is a big part of modern

00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:29,110
power systems so Edison is actually

00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,970
coming back from the grave a bit because

00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:33,010
it turns out that DC has a lot of

00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:35,380
advantages over AC in different

00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,090
applications so DC wiring is actually

00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:39,040
more efficient than AC wiring because

00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,540
there's no skin effect pushing the

00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,400
electrons to the outer surface of the

00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:44,740
wire you can actually use the whole wire

00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,050
including the core to send electrons so

00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:50,110
you don't need as much physical steel to

00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:51,430
run the cables as you do AC it's also

00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,440
fewer conductors it's only two wires

00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,240
positive and negative versus AC where

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,730
you have three phases and then often a

00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,440
returned wire it's also much easier to

00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:02,170
control digitally so there's something

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,390
called static var compensation where you

00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,700
have a very high amount of DC current

00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,080
available and you have your

00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,810
ac system that's going to the rest of

00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,310
the grid and then if any problems happen

00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,770
with the AC signal like let's say starts

00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:16,170
to lag or there's not enough current to

00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:18,630
supply the grid you inject DC current at

00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:20,910
exactly the right time in the phase and

00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:24,420
you can boost and repair AC grids that

00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:26,490
are failing using DC current and some

00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,520
can control circuitry and that's much

00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:31,350
easier to do with DC than AC so I

00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,680
touched on that a little bit but the the

00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,300
one of the biggest positives of DC is

00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,450
that it's a rescue lifeline for other

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:42,000
grids so connecting Quebec and New York

00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,890
is actually a single high voltage DC

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,900
line the longest in the world going

00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,960
straight from the James Bay project Dam

00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:50,160
all the way down to New York City and

00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,410
off of that line our little

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,210
interconnects to local grids and if ever

00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:57,450
one of those grids accidentally shuts

00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:59,190
down or loses power they use the DC line

00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,600
because it's not in sync with the rest

00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,670
of the grid remember all the greats have

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,080
to be in sync together positive negative

00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:07,440
positive and negative 60 times per

00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,970
second together but DC doesn't switch so

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,280
when they have that DC line coming down

00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:13,140
they can use the DC to restart all the

00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,730
spinning turbines and generators than a

00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,550
power plant that need energy to start

00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:20,790
when the rest of the grid has gone black

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:22,320
so when you have a full blackout like if

00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:25,200
anyone remembers the New York black of a

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,210
few years ago you actually need power to

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,740
restart the system you can't turn on a

00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,450
power plant unless you have power to

00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,340
bootstrap it and this is something we

00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,780
see in software as well sometimes you

00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,370
can't start the database server until

00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:38,010
the auth server has started but what if

00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:39,120
the office server was I relies on the

00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,800
database server for some of its

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,660
functionality you end up with circular

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,670
dependencies so one of the major

00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,720
benefits of high voltage DC is that it

00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,000
helps you break those circular

00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,170
dependencies by introducing an extra

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,640
source of power that you can use to

00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,490
restart systems that have gone down and

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,560
the last thing is if super cool I think

00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:57,060
Quebec I think is one of the only places

00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,770
in the world that does this but they'll

00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,020
actually short-circuit the power lines

00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:03,810
and run high voltage DC on them for 30

00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:06,690
minutes to melt all of the ice off of

00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:09,630
the wires so that they'll send thousands

00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:11,130
and thousands of megawatts down super

00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,720
long-distance wires over thousands of

00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:15,000
kilometers and they'll literally just

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,110
get them hot until the ice melts off and

00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,380
then they reconnect them back to the

00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,570
rest of the grid and

00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,700
business continues as usual it's a very

00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:25,260
unique feature of Quebec's power system

00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:27,610
is this deicing based on high voltage DC

00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,740
so the question that you all came here

00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:34,270
to have answered can the power lines run

00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:37,390
TCP it turns out yes and people tried to

00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:39,220
do this for a long time and actually

00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:41,440
today there's a lot of signals running

00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,270
over power lines still so at different

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,770
frequency ranges there are different

00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:47,530
signals and they're coupled on to the

00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:51,250
power lines using capacitors so just

00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:52,810
like with radio in the atmosphere you

00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,370
couple signals with capacitors because

00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,500
capacitors help you filter certain

00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,750
frequencies above a certain range or

00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,580
below a certain range so on our power

00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,380
lines in your house and around the city

00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,510
there are a bunch of different frequency

00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,790
bands the lower frequency bands tend to

00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:10,810
be used for home automation or reading

00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:13,420
meters or small like low bandwidth

00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,800
things and then around them 1 megahertz

00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,890
range is where you start getting

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,960
Ethernet over power so you have wall

00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:22,210
adapters that plug into your wall outlet

00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,070
in your house and you can send Ethernet

00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:25,780
over your power lines in your house to

00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:27,310
somewhere else in your house but of

00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,320
course that signal degrades with

00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:31,750
distance because of capacitative

00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,610
coupling between lines so that Ethernet

00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,170
signal bouncing around in your house is

00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,880
power lines probably doesn't make it to

00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:38,560
your neighbor's house because maybe

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,720
there's a transformer or something else

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,700
that it has to go through so that's a

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,500
bunch of signals and then the real

00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,320
question is can we send internet over

00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,760
really long distances with broadband and

00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,250
yes they tried to do this this was

00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,380
called BPL long distance broadband

00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:56,080
backhaul over long distance power lines

00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,460
and the issue the reason why we don't

00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,740
actually see this happening today is

00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,960
because it turns out astronomers get

00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,690
really really mad the whole power grid

00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,850
is the massive antenna and when you send

00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:09,520
you know megahertz or gigahertz signals

00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:11,170
on this massive antenna you completely

00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,090
drown out everything else in noise

00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:16,150
because it's the largest most effective

00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:19,120
antenna there is so today we actually

00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:20,590
don't run internet over power lines over

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,020
long distances because of the

00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:25,360
interference issues with all the other

00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:28,060
systems in the world and it turns out

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,100
that it's quite difficult you get losses

00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,610
and fiber is easier in the long run

00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:35,019
so this is what like a long distance

00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,310
broadband over power line said it looks

00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:38,290
like you would inject it and then pull

00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,670
it off the lines close to the house and

00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,170
every time there's a transformer you

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,069
have to extract it and then re-inject it

00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,720
on the other side of the transformer

00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:44,920
because transformers aren't good at

00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,480
coupling frequencies that aren't the

00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,990
frequencies that are that they're

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,430
designed for so what does this have to

00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,290
do with software just to wrap this up

00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,630
there are a lot of lessons that we can

00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,100
learn from large grids and how they

00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,639
engineer around failure and dealing with

00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,769
failure

00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:02,050
so grids are designed as as modular

00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:04,079
systems all the interconnects between

00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:06,790
grids are standardized internationally

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,889
there are common pieces that are plugged

00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:10,630
in and used all over the place the

00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,399
frequencies are standardized there are

00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,600
five grade regions in North America and

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,120
there are others in Europe and they all

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,220
communicate with each other in

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,949
relatively standardized ways save for a

00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,630
few regions that are special cases um

00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:24,370
it's a distributed system in the true

00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,449
sense of the word you have all the same

00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,589
issues as you do with software

00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:28,240
distributed systems you have time

00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:29,860
synchronization issues you have two

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,839
Olmecs leaders to decide who comes back

00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,579
online and you have to be able to apply

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,490
back pressure so when there's a lot of

00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:37,810
load in a system you have to somehow

00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,670
respond back to that load and tell

00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,959
people hey stop using so much power or

00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,040
you know tell the power plant that's

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,269
generating hey you need to actually

00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,069
generate more power to come up with this

00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:46,360
so in all the same ways that we deal

00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:48,670
with this in software they have to deal

00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,439
with this in hardware in a critical

00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,269
system so that's the other major thing

00:14:50,439 --> 00:14:55,120
is the power grid is a very critical

00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:56,439
system it's relied on for for millions

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,630
of people's safety it's used in

00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:59,709
hospitals to keep people alive it's used

00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,500
all over the place

00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:05,500
and it needs to be able to degrade

00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:07,420
gracefully so when thoughts happen they

00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:10,779
have lots of systems in place that allow

00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:12,310
them to gradually reduce load or segment

00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:13,569
different parts of the grid individually

00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:16,240
such that they don't take down the whole

00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:18,430
system um so the South Africa over the

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,509
last year has had a lot of issues where

00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,310
they where they do what's called load

00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:23,380
shedding where they'll Brown out whole

00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:25,509
regions or they'll black out whole

00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:27,430
regions in order to save the overall

00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:29,949
health of the power grid that's one way

00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:31,810
to do it another thing that has to be

00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:33,220
dealt with is split brain situations so

00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,959
to power grids go down and then they

00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,610
restart independently they may be

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,959
spinning at different frequencies or

00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:39,519
different rates and when they resync

00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:40,809
they have to actually physically slow

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,220
down the generators until they're in

00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:43,200
sync again and then reconnect them

00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,030
together

00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,500
and you get huge sparks when you close

00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:50,220
these breakers it's pretty cool to watch

00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:52,680
online and then the last thing is it's a

00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:55,680
human system fundamentally like any

00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,240
complex software system it's it's humans

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,610
at the end of the day so Hydro Quebec in

00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,400
Canada is a twenty two thousand person

00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:03,960
company so like Google you know they

00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,760
have similar issues internally where

00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,580
they even just to communicate the specs

00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,660
of what do we do in case of a failure

00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:13,170
you know how do we sell power to other

00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,520
people what happens you know if they

00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,690
don't want to sell power back to us at

00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,790
the same price that we sell it to them

00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:20,550
there's all sorts of politics and things

00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:22,470
that need to be dealt with and as a

00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,940
closing note I want to touch on one of

00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:26,400
the best solutions that Quebec has had

00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,230
for dealing with with massive

00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,870
distributed failures and that is

00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:32,760
designing everything in circles so the

00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:34,740
power for Montreal arrives to Montreal

00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,390
from a circle now there's a ring of

00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,070
pylons that form a circle around

00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:40,140
Montreal and all the power that comes to

00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,820
Montreal goes to the circle and this is

00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,560
cool because if there's a break at any

00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,840
point in the circle the power just takes

00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,520
the long way around and this design is

00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,980
what saved Montreal from many more

00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:52,290
blackouts and power outages over the

00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,730
last couple decades and I think more

00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:56,340
systems should take inspiration from

00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:58,320
this of dealing with a ring of providers

00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,970
such that if any position in the ring is

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,290
broken you can share data around the

00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:04,680
long way around and the whole system

00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:06,570
doesn't go down so that's it thank you

00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,670
so much the conference has gone super

00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:11,339
smooth thank you organizers AV team

00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,900
especially and yeah if I got anything

00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:16,699
wrong or if you want to point stuff out

00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,699
