	Screwing up is easier than ever before! by Joshua Wise

When I was growing up, hardware was quite an expensive hobby. I got to play around some, but I never really got any good at building bigger circuits, because failure was so pricey – if I got something wrong, I had to get out all the etching chemicals again, so I didn’t try anything that I wasn’t absolutely certain of. I think of this all the time, because I feel so lucky that professional-grade manufacturing is much more affordable, and parts are much cheaper – so I can make mistakes to my heart’s content!

I feel like the best ways I’ve learned – both when I’ve built hardware, and when I’ve written software – have been from screwing up, and getting pretty fast feedback as to what went wrong. In this talk, I’ll give you explicit permission to screw up, and I’ll give you some of my most educational moments of when I screwed up – and I’ll give you some pointers so you can start screwing up at home, too!

Joshua blows up electronics less frequently, but not infrequently, when he does work for his clients (they would generally prefer him to blow up nothing at all). He is thankful that they, too, understand that blowing things up is an important part of the R&D process.

	00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,039
all right okay so what I'm here to talk

00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:21,950
about yes you notice the headlamp on on

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,599
my head and I'll be doing some live

00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:26,029
theater here so this is kind of the

00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:27,770
demos could go well or they could go

00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:30,289
completely terribly and we'll find out I

00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:32,210
guess so

00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:35,360
I'm coming with some very exciting news

00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:37,040
in this wonderful year 2020 the era of

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,070
the Internet the year of Linux on the

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,220
desktop it's so much easier to screw up

00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:45,290
than it has ever been before

00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:47,089
you can screw up in so many more ways

00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:49,760
than you ever thought were possible and

00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:52,970
you can make even bigger screw-ups

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,220
- this is really good news

00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,930
no I'm serious this is really good news

00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,030
and over the next 10 minutes I'm going

00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:03,369
to tell you about one of my new favorite

00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:05,630
ways to screw up but before we get there

00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:08,479
we make tiny screw-ups that we learn

00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,920
from every single day and it's important

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,659
that we have the space to do it screwing

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,549
up is how we learn or phrased a

00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:16,940
different way you can't learn without

00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:19,790
space to screw up for work recently I

00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:21,890
was learning rust maybe for the first

00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,270
time or maybe for the third time depends

00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,310
on who you ask

00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,780
and I was just immensely grateful for a

00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,950
compiler that taught me how to screw up

00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:33,530
let me just bring up a little window

00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:35,780
here and I'm going to open up some rust

00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:39,200
here let's see if we can test my

00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,800
knowledge your function main is print

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,930
line I'd like to just print 2+2 here

00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:47,990
easy enough

00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:49,760
rust C main RS and the compiler tells me

00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:52,340
that I've screwed up and the compiler

00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:55,490
helpfully gives me this hint here and

00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:57,350
says ok in order to not do that why

00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:00,470
don't you invoke print line as if it

00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,909
were a macro okay I'll do that and it

00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:06,710
tells me ok I've screwed up one more

00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:08,030
time here and it tells me so the

00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,530
compiler is telling me that I've screwed

00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,599
up and has given me space to screw up

00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:14,360
and rather than crashing the computer or

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:18,260
something else it instructs me how to

00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:21,980
not do that so you can't learn without

00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:24,139
space to screw up and I want to tell

00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,080
briefly to put a little bit of context

00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:28,710
here about a time

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,120
when I couldn't screw up in 2005 it was

00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,680
really really expensive to screw up

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,360
hardware I was a kid I was in high

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,890
school I knew I was interested in

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,690
electronics and hardware and all that

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,280
kind of stuff and it was so expensive I

00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,740
would go to RadioShack and I'd get these

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,940
like $10 resistor kits and if I wanted

00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,950
to get integrated circuits

00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,480
if RadioShack had the one that I wanted

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,710
they were like three bucks a shot and so

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,350
if I blew that up three bucks right

00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,670
there right and if I want to get

00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:53,010
something RadioShack didn't have I'd

00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,350
have to go online and order it I'd go to

00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,940
digi-key and UPS shipping was like 20

00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,650
bucks and it would take like a week and

00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,660
a half for my digit key oh man it was

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,660
bad and like if I wanted to fab outta

00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,850
PCB back in 2005 the cheapest that I

00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:08,430
could do was advanced circuits so that

00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:10,170
was for PCB you might remember if you

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,640
were thinking about those kinds of

00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:15,410
things back then and they had there

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,640
they're $33 each special which wasn't

00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,590
$33 each because you had to order three

00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,810
of them so that was a hundred bucks and

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,300
for your hundred bucks you got three

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:27,630
copies of a two-layer no solder mask

00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:29,070
board in two thousand five dollars so in

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,810
twenty twenty dollars that's one hundred

00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,310
and thirty bucks anyway so like what

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,690
what would you do you know you're a kid

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,120
interested in electronics out would come

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:38,310
the laser jet that you got from the town

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,100
dump and I'd run into photo paper

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,280
through it and I Dyer knit on I get out

00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,110
the nasty etchant chemicals and since I

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,970
didn't have a soldering station you know

00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,220
I had this kind of Weller fire starter

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,080
station I'd solder surface mount parts

00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,670
and my mom's toaster oven hi mom happy

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,400
Mother's Day

00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:58,620
and the results were bad like I would

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,090
end up with like very crispy boards so I

00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,540
didn't make a whole lot of boards and my

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,580
skills

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,400
consequentially never really got very

00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,930
good if you can think about it like you

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,540
could imagine that instead of having a

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,220
compiler that a second later gave you an

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,320
error that told you it was wrong it was

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,200
a compiler that took a whole evening of

00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,459
work and nasty chemicals and didn't

00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,880
really tell you it was wrong just had a

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:24,090
bunch of things shorted together and and

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,120
you blow up your board so I'm here to

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:30,240
tell you that in 2020 screwing up

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,800
hardware is cheap and fast over the past

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,530
couple of years there's been almost an

00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,870
explosion of extremely low cost PCB

00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,770
vendors in the US we have aa spark I

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,440
think they're based out of Oregon

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:45,550
and so there let's see three copies for

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:49,300
five bucks a square inch and it ships in

00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:52,449
nine to twelve days so okay sure

00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:54,639
PCB you a in Shenzhen that's even faster

00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:57,460
and jail CPCB okay here you go

00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,479
PCB plus surface map assembly from two

00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:03,880
bucks you can get anything in Shenzhen

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,860
alright and so this whole thing I didn't

00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,500
really believe it I ordered some circuit

00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,669
boards I designed a board I'll hold it

00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,849
up to the camera in a moment here I

00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:14,770
designed a board and I designed it in

00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:16,330
kicad totally open-source software here

00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,250
there I got them a week later I'm just

00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,960
you got me here just in time to put the

00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:24,759
finishing touches on soldering it here

00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:27,340
so let me show you I've got my little

00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:31,930
USB microscope here I've got a soldering

00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:35,169
iron and all I've got to do is I've got

00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:40,470
to get this voltage regulator right on

00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:40,470
here you can see that it heats up that

00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:51,000
let's just add a little more solder here

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
you

00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:58,920
and you'll see that as soon as the part

00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:00,600
heats up as soon as it wicks you get

00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,250
this little sucking effect where the pad

00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:09,450
or where the part just lines itself

00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:10,710
right up on the pad there right the

00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:12,300
reason why I'm wearing this headlamp is

00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,260
I can get a little extra light on here

00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:23,180
to help with these little tiny

00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:27,530
surface-mount components come here does

00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:31,620
one of those and one of those all right

00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:33,300
all right perfect done deal and the most

00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,760
exciting thing I think the most exciting

00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,710
thing about a board bring up is about

00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,730
getting boards back is the first time

00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,650
you get to power it on so I have my

00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,670
little bench power supply here you don't

00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,380
need a bench power supply to do

00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:47,790
electronics these days you can get away

00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:50,640
with with just so much less that like

00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:52,590
that gave myself two nice little pins

00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,050
there oh the most exciting thing is

00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,490
powering up for the first time oh man

00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:00,720
that just went up and smoke real good

00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,200
that's that's not great that smells

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:07,020
really bad

00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:08,730
oh man ha gotcha gotcha I thought I

00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,200
thought you thought I wasn't expecting

00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,790
that I made this totally classic mistake

00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,650
I assigned the pins on the voltage

00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,720
regulator wrong it happens all the time

00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,040
it just happened on a board that I

00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,770
brought up for one of my clients like

00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:23,850
the experts the pros did this and so

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:25,620
like this kind of thing it's so it's so

00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:28,620
common and this is the kind of thing you

00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,630
couldn't do before and so ok here we go

00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:34,050
another week let's say I just fab doubt

00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:36,150
the the replacement for this and another

00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:39,030
10 bucks later let's just go right back

00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:46,820
over to the cameras here put this one

00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:46,820
right under my microscope yeah

00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:53,469
and so like previously this would have

00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:54,939
been the end of it right I wouldn't have

00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:56,649
done another I wouldn't have done

00:07:54,939 --> 00:08:00,279
another version of this board because

00:07:56,649 --> 00:08:02,859
it's so expensive and it's so it's just

00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:08,829
so agonizing when things go wrong like

00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:12,369
this um I'll a sing it under the

00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:14,789
microscope it's just so agonizing when

00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:19,109
these kinds of things go wrong and you

00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:23,919
know that's it's just miserable right

00:08:19,109 --> 00:08:26,019
and so now that you know now that this

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,609
didn't cost me you know everything that

00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:29,529
I'd earned in a week kind of thing or

00:08:27,609 --> 00:08:31,029
whatever it was it was it's a much

00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:34,029
different story so hang on so let's

00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:38,159
let's power this on this time power this

00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:42,069
put that there get one of those there

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,920
give myself plenty of power and ooh more

00:08:42,069 --> 00:08:48,540
smoke well it smells really bad

00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:51,519
Oh God tantalum caps nope okay so so

00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:53,500
again you can just keep you can just

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,000
keep making mistakes this is the amazing

00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,399
thing that I just love about this

00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,720
process now that just totally wasn't

00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:01,990
possible what happened there I don't

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,269
know if you noticed is on electrolytic

00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:06,490
caps the unelect reloaded capacitor is

00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:08,709
one specific type of capacitor the

00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:10,329
little line you can see it'll point to

00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:13,449
it this little line on the end of the

00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:15,579
cap marks negative but on tantalum

00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:17,199
capacitors it marks positive and this is

00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:18,759
one of those things that yes you could

00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:19,959
learn you could read the datasheet and

00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,009
you could learn that and all that kind

00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,079
of stuff

00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:25,689
and you could let's see if I can pick up

00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:28,839
another one in just place the

00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:30,189
replacement there my hands might be too

00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:32,379
shaky and this board might get away

00:09:30,189 --> 00:09:34,089
without it yeah I think this board will

00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:37,379
be fine with well let's see if this one

00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:37,379
let's see if this one works huh

00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:46,050
the this is one of those things that you

00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:48,480
can learn either by reading Wikipedia

00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:51,560
and reading the data sheets Hey look at

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,759
that it's blinking all right

00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,810
you can learn it that way or you can

00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,279
learn it the hard way and the hard way

00:09:54,810 --> 00:10:01,230
is kind of the more fun way sometimes

00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:02,399
that's kind of my claim so in 2005 this

00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,029
whole thing would have cost me two

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,540
hundred bucks

00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:08,040
and it would have cost me two months and

00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:09,089
that's just for the boards okay and so

00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,699
for the parts it would've been another

00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:14,100
thirty bucks in parts or twenty bucks in

00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:15,209
UPS shipping and really what that would

00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,089
have meant is I would have given up

00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:20,040
before I even tried and so the amazing

00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:21,839
thing is here in 2020

00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,930
I ordered Ford's on a Saturday evening

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:28,019
and they arrived on a Thursday evening

00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:29,790
from Shenzhen and the whole thing cost

00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:32,220
me 20 bucks is I actually ordered both

00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:35,810
rounds because as you may have noticed

00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:38,100
that was a planned screw-up right but

00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,959
okay so that whole thing for ten boards

00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,600
ten totally custom boards two different

00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:44,610
designs in there the whole thing ran me

00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,470
20 bucks shift and then the parts now I

00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,639
ran me about 30 bucks shift I ordered

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,709
those on Sunday evening they arrived

00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:51,149
Tuesday evening and you can do this at

00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:52,740
home I used a hand-me-down soldering

00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:54,720
station from a former housemate and a

00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,949
hand-me-down power supply you can get

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,230
soldering stations for really cheap

00:10:55,949 --> 00:11:00,029
these days if you're daring you could

00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:02,730
cut open a USB cable I'll get you some 5

00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:03,480
volt power this microscope was 25 bucks

00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:08,970
off Amazon

00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:14,399
why wait okay what do I actually have to

00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:18,060
tell you here make mistakes it's so

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,980
important to make mistakes and when

00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,079
you're making mistakes that could be in

00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,579
the compiler it could be when you're

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,350
actually physically assembling things

00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:26,850
you might tear something apart and rip

00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,430
it cable and while you're trying to fix

00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:31,649
it it happens all the time you can't

00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:34,199
learn without it blow some stuff up

00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:36,600
right don't get conservative in your

00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:38,759
designs because you're worried about not

00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,350
letting out the magic smoke let out as

00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:40,589
much magic smoke as you can it's lots of

00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,250
fun

00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:46,829
it smells a little bit bad and the

00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:49,500
overarching thing here is that it's

00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:52,350
important to feel safe screwing up it's

00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,209
important that you feel kind of

00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,519
financially safe and screwing up

00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:58,920
that means that it's a 20-buck disaster

00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,839
rather than a hundred dollar disaster

00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,579
it's important with your compiler to not

00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:04,259
crash your machine and so when rusty

00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:06,540
complains about the borrow checker and

00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:07,980
this and that and the other thing it's

00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,720
important to feel safe that you're not

00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,660
going to like overwrite your root file

00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:16,110
system and so having those guards helps

00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:17,699
us experiment and inhuman spaces it's

00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,069
important to feel safe screwing up also

00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:22,589
I feel like I love the Bang Bang kana

00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:23,730
stetic of we have the hard rules of

00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:26,490
things not to do but we have these

00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:27,839
social rules of the well actually is

00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,519
that somebody can come up to you and say

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,470
you just well actually them and you go

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,990
like oh man thanks for telling me and

00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:37,589
you feel safe making a mistake because

00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:38,970
you know you can learn whether you're

00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:41,369
using rusty or whether you're in a

00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,689
soldering iron or in a in a real life

00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:43,980
space or a virtual space together

00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:46,290
there's never been a better time to

00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,420
screw up thank you to all of you stuck

00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,619
around to the end to watch and thanks to

00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,389
the Bang Bang Connor organized this this

00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:53,579
year who gave us a joyful delight to the

00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:54,929
full and surprising conference despite

00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:56,959
all of us sitting around sheltered in

00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:56,959
