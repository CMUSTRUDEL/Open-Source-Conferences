	Reverse engineer your ski goggles for fun and profit! by Jonathan Kingsley

Do you like tearing down weird hardware? Are you a fan of bringing old things back to life? Do you love to break both legs with the snowsports equivalent of distracted driving? Well, do we have the talk for you! In this talk we’ll somehow fit in: breaking down the demise of Recon Instruments, discuss how to reverse engineer hardware from a company that’s as dead as a doornail, demo some brand new firmware for a 7 year old piece of hardware, and explain how all of this will still not make you cool.

Jonathan is a software engineer by day and live production tech, pyrotechnician, and musical theatre peformer by night. His interests include hardware reverse engineering and information security. He has once set a swimming pool on fire.
