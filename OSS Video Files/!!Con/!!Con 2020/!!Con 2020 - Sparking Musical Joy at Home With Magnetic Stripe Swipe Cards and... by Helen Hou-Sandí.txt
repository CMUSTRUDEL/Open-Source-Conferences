	Sparking Musical Joy at Home With Magnetic Stripe Swipe Cards and Tiny Code! by Helen Hou-Sandi

Voice assistants can be great, but when you throw in noisy households and small people who don’t speak clearly and are asking for things in multiple languages, plus the whole surveillance state thing, they’re not always a great solution! These same small people often don’t read, either, but they have lots of opinions. So what to do when they love music and you’re a programmer who’s tired of being on call as a human jukebox? You build off a video you saw once and bring joy home in the form of a Raspberry Pi, tactilely satisfying magnetic stripe swipe cards, stickers, and a 5 line Bash script!

Helen is the Director of Open Source Initiatives at the fully-distributed agency 10up and a Lead Developer for the WordPress open source software project. When she’s not deep in a code editor or polishing UX, she likes to make complicated food, hang out with her family, and continue performing as a professional collaborative pianist.

right Sonne get started he introduced

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,310
who I am as a work person so that's what

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,230
I do I do computer stuff my day but I

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,330
have my degrees in music performance and

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,540
I do still perform sometimes I'm also as

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,579
mentioned I also have two kids their age

00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:35,579
of seven and three now and they're

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,250
equally opinionated and into music I'm

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:42,360
very opinionated I mention them because

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,680
they're important to the stock so here's

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,750
a question you'll hear for me all the

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,690
time if you work with me what's the

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,250
problem being solved for in my case it's

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,199
that I was spending a lot of my time

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,149
being a human jukebox for my kids

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:56,789
the owner one can manage a lot of things

00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,230
now including voice assistance but the

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,600
younger one isn't quite there yet and

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,269
even if she was our house can be very

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,920
noisy and 90% of people who come here

00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:08,580
are Spanish speakers which gets

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,720
confusing for devices in English I live

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,020
in Costa Rica

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,180
my husband is Costa Rican so that's

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,150
that's why people here speak Spanish and

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,560
they sort of generally did before anyway

00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,450
in any case you should hear the things

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,790
we have to do to get Ella brain-o in

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,350
front you playing the last time I tried

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,850
and I posted a video of this on Twitter

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,940
the last time I tried this I got the

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,800
reply I couldn't find a dreidel infant

00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,300
eel

00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,280
we also have issues for the kids like

00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,890
some songs off of Just Dance where they

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,010
only play edited versions but as much as

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,420
I love her there is no way I'm having my

00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,230
small children listening to an unedited

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:48,360
version of cardi B so they have specific

00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:51,140
things they want to listen to and I want

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:54,210
to be able to take the curate as well I

00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:57,060
had seen this tweet go around whatever

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,490
December 2018 and that's myself I should

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,190
make that some day so with Christmas the

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,960
next year 2019 approaching in two months

00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,400
of school break ahead because our school

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,650
you're here is different than it is in

00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:12,239
the u.s. it was time to solve my cheek

00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:13,980
box problem so first up supplies one of

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,140
the reasons I wanted to build this using

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,970
a Raspberry Pi specifically is because I

00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,410
have three older ones I've gotten miss

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,770
speaker gifts over the years and they're

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,620
just

00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:24,990
hanging around doing nothing I ordered a

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,850
couple more things off Amazon and had my

00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:30,150
very loyal spouse drive them back for me

00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,350
after one of his gigs in the US I could

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,060
probably have found most of stuff

00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,070
locally but electronics can be very

00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,050
expensive and it takes a lot of phone

00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:40,620
calls and driving around to locate

00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:42,960
specific items here is what I used a

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,130
Raspberry Pi it's in a little case that

00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,690
has four Pistons magnetic stripe cards

00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:51,810
card writer which is the bigger one a

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,370
card reader the smaller one and USB

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,770
powered speakers so they wouldn't have

00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,230
to have a separate power source I forgot

00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,060
to include the speakers in this photo

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:03,510
I collected everything and I started

00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,040
testing components first was making sure

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,410
I could get Spotify playback on a

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,620
Raspberry Pi I don't I have no idea what

00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,720
to do after a bunch of googling I

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,390
decided to do this using PI music box

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,640
which was super easy to install and get

00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,620
set up I actually probably took longer

00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,810
trying to find a USB keyboard before

00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,100
realizing that a wireless Apple keyboard

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:27,810
works just fine with vickima plugged in

00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:30,060
and now the next part making the cards

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,220
work my idea was to put Spotify your

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,440
eyes on the cards and have that trigger

00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,900
playback right enter Spotify your eye

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,600
and have pie bass box start the strike

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,610
the track USB card readers or basically

00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,800
keyboard emulators you swipe the card

00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:46,830
and the data is sent to the computer and

00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,540
so you typed it super fast I plugged in

00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,490
my card reader and I swiped an old bank

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,310
card just in case it was like trying to

00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:56,220
steal my data and all I got were some

00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:58,770
numbers so now I've worked in retail and

00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,830
I know that your name is also encoded

00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:05,270
onto the cover here's what I was

00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:08,280
expecting to see a card number my name

00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:09,740
some other information on x1 is a dash

00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,310
in my name I know wasn't expecting that

00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:16,680
the it's like a checksum slash encoded

00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,730
information about like expiration and

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,590
then those numbers are actually repeated

00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:25,950
instead this is what I would get out of

00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:28,979
my card this is real real swiped size

00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:32,310
for my card readers and sometimes I

00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:33,180
would even just get this right so what's

00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,639
going on

00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,699
it turns out I had a faulty card reader

00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,530
of course this would become even more

00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:42,210
evident way later on after everything

00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:45,150
was done because it occasionally since

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:48,169
ghost output will randomly start tracks

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:50,310
I went to a couple of stores nearby

00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:52,440
looking for a new card reader but I

00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,699
couldn't find one and nobody at those

00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,120
stores knew where I could even find

00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:59,460
something like that so I did what all

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,820
coders eventually have to do I hacked

00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:04,169
around it so magnetic stripe cards

00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,030
typically have three tracks of

00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:07,949
information the first thing I'm going to

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,270
store the most data and the second and

00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:11,370
third only being able to hold some

00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:14,220
numbers and it's like a limited number

00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:16,199
of numbers I try to code in Spotify your

00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,880
eyes onto the first track but between

00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,039
the card reader not reading the first

00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,830
track in Spotify URI as being case

00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:25,979
sensitive which if you didn't notice my

00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,599
name was in all caps this was a no-go my

00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:29,639
buggy card reader actually sent me down

00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:30,870
the right direction because otherwise I

00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,650
probably would have tried to figure

00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,330
something out

00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:36,120
involving the your eyes because I was

00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:38,010
sort of mentally stuck on that I decided

00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,650
that my decode just a number onto the

00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:42,419
second and third tracks this also did

00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,280
not work correctly the first time I

00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:46,380
guess maybe the amount of data is too

00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,389
small or something so I had to encode

00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,639
each number with three digits left

00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:53,490
padded with zeros as necessary right

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,110
favorite thing left cat I also decided

00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,150
to encode the number onto all three

00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,699
tracks just to be like super sure that

00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:01,590
it was there so now that this was

00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:04,080
working right I was encoding the card

00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,000
with the card right a with the number on

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,039
all three tracks and then reading it

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,110
with my card reader so now that this was

00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:11,820
working I knew what I had to do I needed

00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:14,669
to have each number corresponds to a

00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:16,800
line in a text file but how do I make

00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:18,270
that text file and manage it with

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,710
hundreds of tracks that could get very

00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:24,330
tedious very quickly well a Spotify

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,340
playlists made a lot of sense

00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:28,080
I could keep stuff in order you can

00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,460
select all and copy it as a list of

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,500
Spotify your eyes which is actually

00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,150
pretty cool and then I have the same

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,060
list of music to play in the car or

00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:41,159
wherever else I also just really love

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:42,840
making playlists so this is this is a

00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:46,349
sweet Charlotte playlist I have a kids

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,710
jukebox playlist very dry naming I can

00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:48,450
add

00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,070
our songs I can add more tracks and

00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,630
change stuff up if like a track those

00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:54,030
defunct right like if I get you locked

00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:56,130
out of a trap or if my kids get tired of

00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,590
the song which happens with children

00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:02,700
this gets copy pasted into a text file

00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:04,050
that goes onto the Raspberry Pi you can

00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:07,380
listen to this for your gaming phone

00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:11,460
okay so now for some code okay the the

00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:13,380
tiny code part of my talk I take taking

00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:16,440
a swipe card input and make you play a

00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:18,780
song I said probably close to a week

00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,750
with that code editor nothing I was just

00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:24,630
staring blankly at it like not even sure

00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:27,690
where to start I first got myself in

00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:30,510
huge circles reading about people's

00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:32,940
python-based setups and RFID chip

00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:34,530
versions and wondering if maybe this was

00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,500
all the state because I don't know what

00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:39,890
I'm doing until finally one night we

00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:45,600
asked the holiday looming I wrote

00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:48,660
something anything yeah it works on the

00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:51,690
first try I genuinely I could not

00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:54,480
believe it this is my first run of code

00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:57,000
it's literally five lines of fashion

00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,620
I chose batch for two reasons one I

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,500
don't have to set up anything else like

00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,570
Python and any associated libraries like

00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,790
for meeting input and two I'm actually

00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:07,770
pretty decent with bash especially after

00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:10,740
were forcing myself to myself to learn

00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:12,090
how to do do bash right bash by doing a

00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,000
bunch of custom things to my prompt

00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:16,770
several years ago this code does exactly

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,200
what it says but there's a pretty

00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:23,100
cryptic fascism and I am the very

00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:25,200
liberal code commenting school so I

00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,900
added comments to that fascism which is

00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,300
called primary expansion and the Senate

00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:32,070
this helps me and anybody else looking

00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,810
because of course as a director of open

00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:37,070
source I wanted to open source this

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:40,260
again this code it worked perfectly

00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:43,380
until I got to card number eight and

00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:46,620
then I would get an error I set her

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:49,500
stunt until suddenly all my years of

00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:54,660
dealing with loose typing in PHP washed

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:57,630
over me octal since I was padding with

00:08:54,660 --> 00:09:00,070
zeros when I got to zero zero eight and

00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:03,280
zero zero none it Yona me that

00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:05,260
that wasn't a real number so a little

00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:09,250
more said to renew those leading zeros

00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:10,900
here on line six then I wanted to add a

00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,970
special case card to tell the play back

00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:15,580
so my kids could stop music as necessary

00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:17,560
PI Music Box does come with a web UI

00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,630
which I sometimes use to manage things

00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,120
from like across the house but the idea

00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:23,920
here was to only use carts this has been

00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,840
extremely successful and my kids

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,850
actually keep that play/pause card at

00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,650
the back of the rack of cards so that

00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,390
they can always find it even the younger

00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:34,180
one has this down she will look and get

00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:35,680
the card and pause playback I decided to

00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,840
use nine nine nine since I was using

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,310
three-digit numbers and I don't have

00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,820
nearly that many cards in there we

00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:44,740
really really hope that I never do and

00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,960
then finally my senior engineering

00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:49,120
mindset make sure you account for error

00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,100
cases here I want to account for not

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,930
finding a number in the input as well as

00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,210
potentially not finding a corresponding

00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:57,340
line in the text file and that's it

00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:59,500
that's the entire script twenty-seven

00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:03,370
lines including comments and whitespace

00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,960
it's tiny code okay so now I have this

00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,640
raspberry pi a little place Spotify

00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,140
tracks off of cards but it still

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,390
requires me to log in and get things

00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,980
started so how do I make it skip manual

00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:15,220
log it and start my script on its own

00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:16,630
that is how do I make it headless you

00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,710
have to worry about memorizing this I

00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:20,020
have everything written out and

00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:21,370
available to you that you can refer to

00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,290
at your leisure this is just to show you

00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:26,200
that's honestly really not that bad do

00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:28,450
you download the file set up the

00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:32,400
automatic login and I make it run

00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:35,710
you heard her file your script on Logan

00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:38,020
so everything was working so now on to

00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,610
the Assembly of the object I went to a

00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,470
couple stores to see if any existing

00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:43,600
boxes jumped out of me as a good

00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,170
solution but did it find anything my

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,540
brother-in-law

00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:48,310
does happen to have a 3d printer but I

00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,640
didn't have any particular design in

00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,620
mind

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,660
and honestly time was running out I

00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:55,030
poked around my endless supply of

00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:58,240
organizers because I'm a slightly

00:10:55,030 --> 00:11:01,330
compulsive organizer and found these in

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,860
my stash some modular stacking boxes

00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:05,200
from one of my favorite places The

00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,480
Container Store and heavy-duty double

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,580
sided tape seriously this tape does not

00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,290
an add that this tape is ridiculous I

00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,390
actually since acquired a properly

00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:15,160
working card reader but I can't pry it

00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,810
off the old one so I haven't actually

00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,210
replaced that part they just randomly

00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:24,310
plays other tracks sometimes anyway a

00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:26,290
little cable organizing later and tada

00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:28,720
compact little jukebox ready pretty

00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:32,710
gifted but wait I haven't talked about

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:35,290
the perfect yet they're stickers I love

00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:37,180
stickers now that in tight that

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:39,340
inspiration project that I talked about

00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,990
at the beginning also used stickers but

00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,610
the creator wrote an entire react app

00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,590
that pulled the artwork for him and

00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,620
everything I may be a programmer but I

00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:48,910
am not made like that so I returned

00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,370
something I actually know how to use

00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:53,080
which is a graphics editor so shout out

00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,970
to anybody else whose formative web

00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,580
experiences include Paint Shop Pro I

00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:59,890
made myself a template and then grabbed

00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,900
album art manually another reason why I

00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:03,370
decided to get art myself was because I

00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,260
didn't always want the album art that

00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,060
descriptor to grab so for instance for

00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,620
Mother Goose club songs I wanted to get

00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,600
a screenshot from the video for the song

00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,090
so that my dad 2 year old can identify

00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,280
the specific song she wanted because as

00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:17,740
far as I think my kids are a 2 year old

00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,440
is not reading titles and artists off of

00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:22,060
label I exported these as PDFs and

00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,410
headed to a nearby office supply store

00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,740
to have them printed out on adhesive

00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,930
paper

00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:28,210
Lefter then cut to size and applied to

00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,710
the carts I did everything in numerical

00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,360
order you might have noticed I wrote a

00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:33,610
number in sharpie on the back of the

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,560
card in a previous picture I'm so that

00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:38,470
kept it easy but also I very much

00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,330
believe in trust the verify so i spiked

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:44,740
every single card before applying the

00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:46,540
label and yes it includes BTS so finally

00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,100
I presented this to my kids and show

00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,870
them how it worked and after just a

00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,060
couple of days both of them were masters

00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,110
of their new musical domain I put in on

00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,090
a little shelving unit in the area

00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,540
between their bedrooms and completely on

00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,700
their own

00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,290
I promise on their own they negotiated

00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,760
key system between them where they light

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,130
up cards on the shelf for what they want

00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,170
to play next they have absolutely loved

00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:06,640
their own little device my 7 year old

00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:08,290
loves to tell people that it's mom made

00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,480
this because she's the best programmer

00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:12,670
and it's just an all-round joy watching

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,080
them use a tackle device that brings

00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,240
them something that they love digitally

00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,950
I hope you've enjoyed hearing about my

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,630
first foray into Hardware tinkering I

00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,140
have everything that you need to get it

00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,820
going

00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,590
the sticker template and files to make

00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:26,830
the card making easier available on my

00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:29,200
github where I'm just Helen and here's a

00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:31,680
little demo for you brought to you by my

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,680
younger child
