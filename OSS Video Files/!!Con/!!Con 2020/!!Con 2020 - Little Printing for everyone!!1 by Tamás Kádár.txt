	Little Printing for everyone!!1 by Tamás Kádár

Do you remember the Little Printer? It was an internet-connected, super cute thermal printer, which printed you your calendar and news headlines in the morning; you could even message your friends if they also had one. It was a commercial flop and the servers were shut down in 2015, but that’s only the start of our story. Today, with a little work, you too have your own Little Printer — and now you can use any thermal printer for it (some assembly required).

Tamás is a generalist working in DevOps and Infrastructure lately, automating all the things. He’s really into writing lately and loves the world’s most pointless drink, a decaf iced latte.

	00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:18,020
so for a few years now I've had a thing

00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:20,600
for instant photography it started in

00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,880
early 2015 when I discovered Fuji Instax

00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,340
share a portable printer that used

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,140
insects mini film that food is poor it

00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:30,100
essentially and attracted to your

00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:34,010
smartphone via Wi-Fi to print pictures I

00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:36,110
also had the DSLR back then with a knife

00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,960
is the card that automatically sent all

00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:40,640
the images I've taken to my phone

00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,650
combining those two things I was able to

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,059
take a portrait of someone and print it

00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:48,650
out for them just under two minutes it

00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:52,879
was my magic trick and everyone loved it

00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:54,339
in the fall of 2016 I attended the xoxo

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,690
festival for the first time

00:00:54,339 --> 00:00:58,250
xoxo is an experimental festival for

00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,830
independent artists who live and work

00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,780
online it's one of the best events I've

00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:05,089
ever attended along with bang bang con

00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,850
of course and it's also full of the most

00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:09,860
wonderful people every attendee also

00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:12,140
gets an invite to the festival slag like

00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,240
you all did to this court if you get a

00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,700
ticket and the slag has hundreds of

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,369
channels it's where we keep in touch for

00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,930
the rest of the time I'm going to do a

00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:23,750
project at xoxo

00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,200
so as an icebreaker I just use my magic

00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,780
trick

00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,299
I took portraits of the attendees and

00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,840
printed it out for them it worked really

00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:33,439
well

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,859
I got on the snapchat page of MailChimp

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,659
for example I even collected all the

00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:44,450
pictures on the side called faces of

00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:46,909
xoxo 2016 in 2018 some of the EXO slag

00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,530
posts about the paper and p1 this

00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:50,689
Chinese made portable printer use

00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:53,179
regular form of paper and directed by

00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:55,249
Bluetooth to your phone it had a quirky

00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:57,289
app that lets you print text images and

00:01:55,249 --> 00:02:00,200
much of other things in black and white

00:01:57,289 --> 00:02:01,909
it costs like $60 you could even get

00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,670
sticker paper for it which is lots of

00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:07,189
fun the main type sound I knew I needed

00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:10,780
one this was how I was going to step up

00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:14,780
my portrait game for the next xoxo and

00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:16,490
so I did at the festival people have two

00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,650
versions of their portraits one in

00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:20,780
Instax in full color and everything and

00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:25,470
bought from the paper and that had a

00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:27,900
very retro 8-bit look people loved it I

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:30,210
I repeated the project a Texan 2019 and

00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,980
shortly after that I started thinking

00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,880
about how I could change things up and

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,020
gives his project a new twist

00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,000
someone at the festival took a few

00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,440
pictures with the game work camera and

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,720
they awesome

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,570
I remembered the Raspberry Pi and

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,110
haven't had a camera module so I started

00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:51,690
thinking what if I could fool Lofa and

00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,280
use that with the paper and somehow the

00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,930
cherry on top could be processing all

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,240
the images with the at concern littering

00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:59,610
the money used in hyper cart which is my

00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:03,600
favorite living algorithm because

00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:06,450
everyone needs funny but the paper

00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,220
ranked as far as I knew anyway only at

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,650
this proprietary mobile app and nothing

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,420
else after trying to reverse engineer

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,760
the apk without much success

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,770
I discovered that it had a desktop app

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,380
on the Chinese language size of the

00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:24,090
manufacturer it lets you print from your

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:25,680
Mac or PC via USB and Bluetooth it

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,660
didn't take long from there to discover

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,060
that some reverse-engineer the protocol

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:34,500
the printer was using and made it into a

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:36,150
Python library anyone could use around

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,620
the time I was thinking about all the s

00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,640
and doing all the research for a camera

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:43,230
I discovered that my friend Josh Mae was

00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,570
working on a project called serious

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:49,230
client that lets you turn any printer

00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:51,750
into a little printer and this is the

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,890
point where you might be asking what is

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:57,420
or more like what was the little printer

00:03:54,890 --> 00:04:00,540
well it was an internet-connected

00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,130
thermal printer released in late 2012 by

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,209
the British rocket experiment group

00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:08,190
better known as Berg it connected by a

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:10,860
ZigBee to the Berg cloud bridge their

00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,690
own IOT hub it was supposed to be just

00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:16,049
the first of many devices of a future

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,489
ecosystem of connected products the

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:19,530
laser printer came with an app that

00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:20,970
could do lot of things pretty the

00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,130
weather and the headlines in the morning

00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:26,850
your friends Foursquare check-ins tiny

00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:28,440
puzzles and so on even better if a

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,300
friend of yours also the little printer

00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,220
you could send messages to each other

00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,340
sprinters essentially giving you a

00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:38,220
printer based social net most

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:42,090
importantly the little printer was cute

00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,680
just look at it and sure it may have

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:47,220
been a novelty product but it was a

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,440
really fun one the new printer did ok

00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,020
commercially bird made back its

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,810
investment at least despite its steep

00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,840
sterling past 199 pounds that was later

00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,640
reduced to under than 49 pounds its

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,620
premium price and design was necessary

00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,020
because the internals will cost the back

00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,210
then remember this is more than 10 years

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,130
ago when they start designing it the

00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,470
most expensive part being the thermal

00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,870
printing module that's also the reason

00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:15,840
why its use zip be and not Bluetooth

00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,730
Bluetooth chips for prohibitively

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,720
expensive when they started designing

00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:24,630
the product what didn't do so well

00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,000
though overall was Berg's IOT platform

00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:28,770
the word cloud while the company

00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,930
released the death kit and built many

00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,720
interesting prototypes for it including

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,340
an internet-connected washing machine

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,500
designing manufacturing and releasing a

00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,900
product takes years and they've done

00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,740
plenty but they kind of ran out of time

00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:47,100
and late 2014 the startup just ran out

00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,720
of money they kept the server's alive

00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,810
for the little printer until the end of

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,880
2015 and more importantly before they

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:57,530
were turned off Burt open sourced the

00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:00,479
simple real implementation of the server

00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:03,870
code name series which only had the

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:06,930
messaging component the API and much as

00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:10,500
if you hacked your Burke out bridge you

00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:12,600
could connect it to the new server not

00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,510
much happens for the next four years

00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,550
but in 2019 a company called North

00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:19,770
projects revived the printers and the

00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:21,720
ecosystem around them they did new

00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,910
features and a better API to the server

00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,750
and released a brand new mobile app as

00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:30,960
well for iOS I've always wanted a little

00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:35,340
printer but back in 2012 I couldn't be

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,960
justify spending 2200 ads on it you

00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,790
can't really find them on ebay anymore

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,770
either

00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:43,140
however by correcting Josh's Universal

00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:45,030
brief slash printer project with the

00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:47,610
library that connects to my paper I'd be

00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:50,669
one I could have my own little printer

00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:52,650
and so can you

00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:54,770
on this slide you can see a diagram of

00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:57,150
how everything connects to each other

00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:59,340
North project has a serious server

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:02,520
running that anyone can connect to or

00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:04,199
you could even spin up your own Josh is

00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,360
serious clients library connects to it

00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:09,479
pretending to be a bird cloud bridge for

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,460
the little printer connected to it that

00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:13,650
project communicates via the file system

00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,629
with the Python papering library visit

00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,249
the end of the day serious simply sends

00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:19,319
a picture-perfect image to the client

00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:21,270
for printing that one can just dump into

00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,969
a folder that's being washed and then

00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:26,639
printed one of the advantages of this

00:07:23,969 --> 00:07:30,090
specific model papering is that it used

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:34,740
the same size and resolution as the

00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:37,979
original little printer serious new api

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:40,379
accepts plain text arbitrary HTML images

00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:44,900
or json so you can even hook it up to a

00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:47,819
fdtd or sepia or whatever you want and

00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:50,939
here's a sort of live demo of how it

00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:52,729
works on this first video I'm sending a

00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:55,110
message to my own printer via the app

00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:58,259
this is as simple as it gets

00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:00,569
of course you can have anyone's printer

00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:02,909
if you know their client key that thing

00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:10,469
you send the message picture or drawing

00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:14,129
or whatever to someone else and here's

00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:19,800
me printing HTML via the API using curl

00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:21,629
for the sake of simplicity there are

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,759
already people creating new things for

00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:26,370
the little printer or remaking old

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,550
things that were once available you can

00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:32,339
see a few of them above cocktail recipe

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:35,789
is whether to do or checking how many

00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:38,880
people are in space right now printer

00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:42,959
based social networks are fun even if

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,760
their serves Fair's spares Mac stockings

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,829
put up his back-end that laser printer

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,360
to divide open Internet by a Google

00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:52,740
Cloud Print and posted it to Twitter

00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,720
people sell all kinds of cool stuff to

00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:58,440
him and he posts the most interesting

00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:01,940
ones I want us to have our own faith

00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:04,410
with the printer based social network so

00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,810
