Description: 
	EMAIL! by Char Stiles

I am going to talk about EMAIL! Yes, email! Not to complain about email, but the good parts of email, like the cool stuff that we can do with it: maintain a git repo, display html, run your own email server, use a CLI inbox, and make art. For so many, it is the most used form of digital communication that only necessarily relies on a protocol, and not a company or institution. Email was born in the 70s and itâ€™s not going anywhere!

I will share my journey making my own mischievous email server, which aims to bring a spark back into email communication. I will also go over the protocol (this talk is still 10 min, the protocol is just that simple!).

Hopefully at the end of this talk everyone can appreciate email a little more, and perhaps some will agree with me that email is totally metal.

Char Stiles thinks about email protocol a lot, but spends all day practicing social protocol by writing and sending emails. Char is very much online with the handle @charstiles on many social media platforms, with a home page at www.charstiles.com.

I'm sure she heard or they'd them and

00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:24,320
I'm here to talk to you about email

00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:25,939
today and my mind qualifications for

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,730
talking to you about email is that I am

00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:30,890
an avid email user that's right you can

00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,960
talk about email just as much as I can

00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,720
and we can all talk about email and I'm

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,070
super excited that there's a there's a

00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,660
channel to talk about it afterwards

00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,489
because there's a lot of people who have

00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,860
a lot of really great things to say

00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:44,000
about it so far even even so far there's

00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,299
there's been a lot of really great

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,299
postings about it about just about email

00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:59,210
in the in the channel okay cool so let's

00:00:53,299 --> 00:01:00,979
get excited about email but why after

00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:04,339
all like many of the tools that we use

00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:06,890
today email is a tool that was made is a

00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:07,970
wartime tool it was made at the Internet

00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,010
it was made for the Internet's

00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,979
predecessor ARPANET by Roy Tomlinson and

00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:15,010
even that the beginning of email the

00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:18,289
inventor of email is contested it's

00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:20,799
debated between who made email between a

00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:24,259
Shiva ayyadurai who created the kind of

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,939
desktop a desk analogy for email and Roy

00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:28,310
Tomlinson appeared like the the protocol

00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:32,840
for it's like very heatedly contested

00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:34,759
who made email and also the email is is

00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,829
is people say the email is exactly like

00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:38,509
the posts or is is analogous to the post

00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:40,159
system except all of the letters are

00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:41,749
trans and all of the envelopes are

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,520
transparent so it's like okay why are we

00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:44,960
getting I should get excited about this

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,259
thing that's just kind of here all the

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,929
time and also there's spam email of

00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:54,049
course this is this is one of the lowest

00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:57,770
voted Stack Overflow questions how to

00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:59,329
send 100,000 emails of meekley because

00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:02,479
everyone just hate everyone has such

00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:04,280
like a just hate spam mail why why do

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,539
you want to send 100,000 emails weekly

00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,100
than any of they don't even talk about

00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:12,080
it's really funny okay so what well

00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,780
email for me and many others is the only

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,500
method of long-distance communication

00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:20,800
that doesn't necessarily have to rely on

00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,450
a big tech company or the government

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,210
it's you could debate both of those are

00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,710
for-profit so technically you can write

00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,090
your own email server which is this is

00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,930
the reason what got me excited about you

00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,580
know in the first place

00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:34,040
I just recently started kind of

00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,110
investigating it I guess like recently

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:41,690
in this stand of email stand is born in

00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:45,140
the 70s and so and also there's a call

00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:47,210
to embrace maintenance over innovation I

00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:50,210
think Titans keynote touched on this a

00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:51,980
lot too and that like emails here and

00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:54,770
it's here to stay and the email is like

00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,180
the internet passport at the you know

00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,190
it's always been the internet passport

00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,860
it's kind of like if you want to you

00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,420
know have an identity on social media

00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,730
use your email if you want to get

00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,770
verified on neopets and use your email

00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,390
it's just kind of like the form of a

00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,370
notification that everyone uses and so

00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:13,070
it can be it kind of has this potential

00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:16,670
to because it can't have substantial to

00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:18,290
be peer-to-peer and and it's already so

00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,850
widespread it has a lot of potential

00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,610
hidden within it and so that's why

00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:26,690
that's what my big inspiration of this

00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:29,420
talk is about and now where we kind of

00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:31,040
got over like the big overview I want to

00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,840
introduce I'll talk to a little bit

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,950
about some cool email fun facts I came

00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:41,930
across somebody research you can this is

00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:44,360
in the e the SMTP secure secure Mail

00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,770
Transfer Protocol we'll get back to SMTP

00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:50,930
later but this is in the SMTP

00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:52,880
specification in that you can add a plus

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,190
at the end of the first part of your

00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,740
email so if your email is like contact

00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,330
char Styles comm I can do contact plus

00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,640
and then I can put whatever I want and

00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:03,020
it'll send it fine it'll ignore

00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,700
everything after the plus I like to

00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:07,040
think about it as you could make it a

00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,780
little diary that you can put in you

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,490
know how you're feeling that day when

00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,870
someone emails you back robot you mosey

00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:14,030
back with that you mother oh yeah I was

00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,710
feeling like that that day and also in

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:19,120
the excessive vacation it ignores dots

00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:23,360
so I can be char Styles or I can be

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:26,570
tiles another really cool story about

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,170
email is how get came to be you can and

00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:33,140
get itself like the like the yeah the

00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:36,200
yeah get itself is maintained through an

00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,850
email list and that's I'm gonna have I

00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,080
had to put one slide about this story

00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,620
just because it's really cool so

00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,470
dinosaur

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,330
had Linux being maintained on this like

00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,790
company servers called bitkeeper

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:50,610
and when bitkeeper started to kind of

00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:52,400
roll out its like paid plan they wanted

00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:56,190
to get away from that and so he made git

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,139
which allowed you to self to have your

00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:02,280
own open source project be self hosted

00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:04,740
and for it to be maintained through an

00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,800
email list that you would send a request

00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,090
to a patch as like a to the email list

00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,500
and then it would relay that to everyone

00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,330
else and then people would comment on

00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,040
like an email chain and that email chain

00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:18,560
is a documentation for the patch and so

00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,560
it created a more conversational based

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:26,190
like maintenance system so I think

00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:27,840
that's really cool I haven't tried me

00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:30,780
like sending a patch through an email

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,530
yet but I'll it's a goal to do that one

00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,380
day

00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:38,310
and I want it so I said I'd go over SMTP

00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:40,050
again I really this is again in the RFC

00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:44,789
which is kind of like the internet

00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:46,680
standard protocol document of SMTP it's

00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:49,229
just it's just really simple I wanted to

00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,720
kind of go over how you can hand send an

00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:54,510
email so this is hypothetically how you

00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,660
can send an email like using a few of

00:05:54,510 --> 00:06:00,090
Windows you would install telnet and if

00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,220
you have Linux or Mac you can use netcat

00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,930
and so you'd say telnet or netcat and

00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,669
then you just say the server that you're

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,330
gonna be connected to send then the port

00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:10,889
it's just 25 which is it you know then

00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,200
you say it so this is part of the

00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:15,660
protocol now so after you connect to

00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:19,800
that you start writing SMTP protocol the

00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:21,930
first thing you you write is hello with

00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,139
1l and I just think that's most adorable

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:27,810
thing you can also do eat a Hello or e

00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:29,460
what is it eh L oh I don't know why they

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:32,430
could you either one it's like so

00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,900
wishy-washy I I love it and then you can

00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,860
say you don't have to but then you're

00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,919
supposed to say the server that you're

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,660
connecting to and then after that you

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,910
can say whatever you want so you can say

00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,800
this is called like the SMT banner so

00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,630
you can see like hello and then the

00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,440
server you're connecting to nice to meet

00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:48,870
you

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,280
um you don't even have to put the server

00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,720
there but if you don't you probably in

00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,670
it there's a lot of things that can get

00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,930
you put on the spam list

00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,950
but I'll gonna get a little more into

00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,050
that later right now we're kind of

00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:01,020
looking at the the beautiful simplicity

00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:02,880
of SMTP and then you say oh you're from

00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,220
like you just say who you are and then

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,310
it there's no verification just say hey

00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:10,350
what's up I'm this when you say oh

00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:14,220
you're sending it to and then you start

00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:16,530
the status it kind of prepared yeah I'm

00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,660
gonna put my data again so this is the

00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,950
display name eyes for like the email

00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:24,170
renderer for like you know whatever

00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:27,060
you're using Oh am I already at 53 oh

00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:29,400
when did I start it's okay

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:34,650
okay and then you just have the subject

00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:36,720
and and then the email body and you end

00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,940
it with a period it's like a sentence I

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,400
just love the simplicity of this but I

00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:43,620
wanted to quote a Hillary Orman who

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,480
wrote a great book about email

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,810
encryption she says though they seem

00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:50,430
like a logical it though they seem

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:55,260
logical it runs into a variety of

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:56,670
problems so yeah that's it's it's also

00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:01,230
it's really simple but then I run the

00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:02,760
two burning problems so email because of

00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,560
the simplicity because it's like almost

00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,590
naivety it becomes sort of like a

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,480
Frankenstein's monster where where where

00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,850
things just started to you to like for

00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:14,310
like for like attachments you just had

00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:16,950
bored of the header then you have you

00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,630
have mime for that and then you have

00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,950
other sorts like if you want to add

00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,690
encryption you just keep adding on to

00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:24,000
the header and it becomes this kind of

00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:25,590
like like this Frankenstein of a

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,360
software but honestly like what software

00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:30,540
doing is this not a Frankenstein so you

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,220
know so I was thinking how do we get how

00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,200
do we go how are we gonna get you know

00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,250
more excited about email now I was

00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,470
thinking I was thinking I was thinking

00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,990
and I thought oh what's hot right now

00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:42,090
there's this Bitcoin or 3d printing is

00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,020
machine learning those things are pretty

00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,150
hot right now

00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,490
alright and I say what's up the

00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:52,260
intersection of these of these three

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:56,400
things well they're all pretty

00:08:52,260 --> 00:09:00,860
unreliable unreliable Bitcoin unreliable

00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:04,800
3d printing unreliable machine learning

00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:06,899
well are you familiar unreliable be that

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,240
I just needs faith

00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:12,600
just these little things you pray to it

00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,069
a little bit to work and that's why I

00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,399
made computer faith which is my email

00:09:14,069 --> 00:09:19,379
server and I'll show you I'll just show

00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,360
you it really quick so it's it's really

00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:23,369
sad it's really it's not like I know a

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,589
lot of people very seriously serve their

00:09:23,369 --> 00:09:27,360
mails email but I feel like I just get

00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:30,470
that into this venture so it's not at

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,470
all anything that I need

00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:38,519
yeah so you know but I wanted to show

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:42,059
you so so so the special thing about

00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:43,470
this email server is that when you

00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:48,689
compose a message just something to send

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:54,119
a message to myself me and I'm gonna say

00:09:48,689 --> 00:10:01,709
this hello oh no no I'm gonna use one oh

00:09:54,119 --> 00:10:06,749
hello I have okay and and then if you go

00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:08,999
here oh no where is it they're not send

00:10:06,749 --> 00:10:12,480
it to myself here message okay cool

00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:13,319
oh it doesn't look exactly the same way

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,870
that it should

00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:18,749
that's because in this email server I

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:21,559
randomly replaced letters and I do some

00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:24,720
sort of so it's like it it kind of is

00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:27,600
mischievious in the way that it doesn't

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,040
accurately send your message and you

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,269
kind of have to it like I think that if

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,999
you were to sort of send this you would

00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:34,259
kind of get it I have faked okay I get

00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:36,899
it

00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:38,850
but it's not necessarily like it doesn't

00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:41,100
necessarily make sense that is what is

00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:44,129
this anyways that's that's my unless my

00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,749
email server that doesn't it just says

00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:49,980
some simple text replacement but it was

00:10:45,749 --> 00:10:54,029
just really fun to make anyways let's go

00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:55,199
back into my presentation again yeah if

00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,189
there's one thing that I want to take

00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:57,629
away from this talk I'm going to keep

00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:59,009
I'm gonna echo them and it kind of roll

00:10:57,629 --> 00:11:02,429
off the kind of sentiment that's been

00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:05,490
going on here so it like as a Dylan said

00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:06,959
he says that Dylan talk was about DNS I

00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:10,019
really really love that talk obviously

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:12,389
especially historically about an old

00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:14,339
protocol the things that that people

00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:16,699
were and weren't thinking about when it

00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:19,049
was made and we need to approach this

00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:20,579
anthropologists kind of like okay so now

00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:22,410
email is the

00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,910
way that it is and and if we can just

00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:27,350
kind of work with that and kind of

00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:32,790
create something new and beautiful and

00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:37,439
that you know yeah is anyone have any

00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:39,899
email lists no start one if you so

00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:43,499
desire and please this is my call to use

00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:45,149
the email the email discord channel as a

00:11:43,499 --> 00:11:46,529
way that kind of put your email list

00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:47,730
because I think that I've been starting

00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:49,739
to like subscribe to all my friends

00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:53,850
email this and it really made my inbox a

00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:59,699
nicer place I have an email list you can

00:11:53,850 --> 00:12:01,139
join it if you so desire oh yeah you can

00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:02,850
join that I don't know if you want to

00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:04,589
but if and if you do it's just gonna be

00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:08,959
like updates and thoughts and stuff like
