	Printing floating point numbers is surprisingly hard!! by Gargi Sharma

Not many of us have wondered “how are floating-point numbers rendered as text strings?” and for good reason! This doesn’t seem like a hard problem to solve! But even in 2020, you don’t have guarantees in some languages that when you convert a string to float and vice versa you will get the same number! In this talk we will explore why printing floating point numbers is hard, arbitrary precision arithmetic, and the state-of-the-art dragon algorithms for printing floating point numbers!

Gargi is a software engineer who loves systems programming, planning elaborate city walks and Modern Art.
