Description: 
	Trapped in codepoints no more! I’m freeing Chinese characters by Gábor Ugray

Unless you’re one of the 1.5 billion people who learned to write Chinese in school, you probably only know the script as that remarkable thing where you must master thousands of characters to read the daily paper. But those thousands of characters have a structure: they mix, re-mix, combine and shuffle and creatively glue together only a few hundred components.

Together, this makes up an intricate system where elements combine with other elements, adding a piece of meaning here and hinting at the pronunciation there. The details are often more arcane than the spelling of English words, but if you get the knack of the system, the script as a whole suddenly starts making sense. The way computers encode Chinese characters erases all of this. There are no components, no shapes, and no system of interlocking parts. It’s all reduced to one code point per character.

I’m showing you how I’m building a dataset of Chinese characters and their parts. I promote SVG shapes to first-order citizens with meaning, sound, and historical background. The knowledge is out there in print books and unstructured digital content, but it’s never been collected in a thought-through machine-readable format. It’s a long journey: in 2 years I’ve covered 20% of the 9,000 characters in common use today.

I’ll conclude by showing the incredibly cool tools this dataset makes possible, from an interactive two-dimensional graph of every Chinese character to a unique cross-linked character dictionary app.

	00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:19,160
so thank you for the introduction I'm

00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:24,590
Gabbar and I am here today to tell you

00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:27,020
about my quest to free Chinese

00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:31,730
characters from the constraints of just

00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:35,960
being Unicode code points there are

00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:37,850
about an adult educated adult person who

00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,239
speaks Chinese knows about five to eight

00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:43,550
thousand characters I'm one of the non

00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:46,070
Chinese persons who are trying to

00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:49,879
acquire the script with mixed efforts so

00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:51,679
let me start with impossible and just to

00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:54,079
give you an idea of how that even works

00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:58,309
give you a crash course into the Chinese

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,960
writing system in three minutes so I

00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:03,010
picked the character which I like it is

00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,420
a pronounced Yong and it means shadow

00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:07,460
and I will use this to explain a couple

00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,230
of things so these characters are made

00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,110
up of strokes you don't just draw them

00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:14,090
any which way you use specific strokes

00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,890
there are about a dozen of those like a

00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:19,490
little vertical line a little horizontal

00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,840
line or a hook you draw those strokes in

00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,460
a particular order this is all

00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,740
standardized and this is stuff that you

00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,950
start acquiring when you start acquiring

00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:30,290
and the writing system itself this

00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:33,230
character has 15 strokes if you want to

00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,910
see it animated this is what it looks

00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:37,600
like this is what your pen actually does

00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:40,790
when you write this character on paper

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,040
now in a more meaningful level these

00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,470
Chinese characters these nine thousand

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,390
Chinese characters are made up of

00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:49,310
components they have some internal

00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:53,210
structure so here I already used colors

00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:56,360
to highlight two components here the one

00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:59,660
on the left is pronounced King it means

00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,220
bright and its purpose in our shadow

00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,770
character is to hint at the

00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,990
pronunciation the one on the right the

00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:08,420
three lines it come in a bunch of

00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:10,039
different things hair or just stripes or

00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,050
a pattern here it is used to mean

00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:14,360
pattern and it contributes meaning so

00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:17,239
our shadow character is basically made

00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,830
up of farm so the way to interpret it is

00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:21,079
that this is something that has to do

00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:23,629
with patterns that sounds roughly like

00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:26,390
Jing so that's how it makes up being

00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:28,250
shadow now this goes on so the one

00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,020
on the left itself has some more

00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,000
internal structure remember as a

00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,340
standalone character it is pronounced

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,350
yin and means bright at the top it has

00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,690
the character for Sun which is literally

00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:40,760
like a drawing of the Sun in an abstract

00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,440
form and on the right it has another

00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,870
character which happens to be pronounced

00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,280
king it means capital city this is

00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,709
actually the character that's in the

00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:53,840
second part of Beijing so like northern

00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:56,540
city the cheek area of China but the

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,150
script itself is not a hierarchy it's a

00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,940
network so I hate everything else now

00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:04,430
and just left these components because

00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,590
they combine with other elements of the

00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,300
script in multiple different ways to

00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,040
generate a whole bunch of other

00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,000
characters so here I gave a couple of

00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:17,150
examples for all four of these shapes

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,540
and this is how using basically a few

00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:23,420
hundred basic components the Chinese

00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:26,090
script is able to generate the thousands

00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:30,260
of characters that you need to master

00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:32,660
the writing system now it might sound

00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:35,150
very straightforward but things do get

00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:39,890
tricky so let's take a look at the

00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:42,620
capital character the King character you

00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:44,420
might be forgiven to mean to think that

00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,459
it actually can be further decomposed

00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,350
into these three components which really

00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:51,200
are part of the writing system a lid a

00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,640
mouth and something for small but it

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,260
actually doesn't make a lot of saying

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,079
how does the lid on the mouth and small

00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:58,910
give out the meaning for capital city

00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:01,100
and it does not so this is a false

00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,450
decomposition the shapes are right but

00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,450
this is not where the character actually

00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,920
comes from at the bottom I dug up a

00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,720
couple of depictions of what this

00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,820
character looked like in the past it was

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,280
basically a drawing of a tall building a

00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:16,970
tower which was associated with capital

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,220
cities now the fact is in order for to

00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,260
make sense of the writing system you

00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,270
have to have a reliable source of

00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,550
interpretations and any such reliable

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:27,020
source actually has to be based on the

00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:30,740
history and evolution of these

00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:33,740
characters blue the language learner now

00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,900
when all of this shows up in Unicode

00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:39,110
here's a screenshot from a font editor

00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,689
font Forge of our shadow character and

00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,909
its name

00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:45,119
hood these are just you know increasing

00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:47,580
you know numbers all of the disarray is

00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:49,019
all of this interconnectedness all of

00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,959
this internal structure and

00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:54,599
relationships these are just isolated

00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:57,209
characters now if you look at how a

00:04:54,599 --> 00:05:00,059
particular font represents the character

00:04:57,209 --> 00:05:02,369
itself is just an outline so this also

00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:04,499
erases the fact that these characters

00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:06,959
are made up of strokes that the strokes

00:05:04,499 --> 00:05:10,139
together form components and they

00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:13,199
somehow contribute meaning to this

00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:15,539
character so computers the way they

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,339
represent the Chinese pretty much erase

00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:20,669
all of the interesting and meaningful

00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:23,399
things now a couple of years ago a

00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:26,610
brilliant person Shauna came up with a

00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:29,189
project called make me a honza there he

00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:31,169
took an open-source so this is a

00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:33,869
screenshot from his project's website he

00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:37,529
took an open-source font which he can

00:05:33,869 --> 00:05:40,019
reuse used some really really magical

00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:44,099
brilliant geometrical algorithms and

00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:46,939
heuristics to basically figure out where

00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:49,619
they can be cut into different strokes

00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:50,819
that provided almost perfect results

00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:53,339
that needed a little bit of manual

00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:56,519
review and basically now we have a data

00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:58,559
set of about 9,000 characters which go

00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:01,050
from the part at the top left the

00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:03,179
outline of characters to the strokes

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,909
that make up the character in the right

00:06:03,179 --> 00:06:07,829
order with the right directions so this

00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:10,289
is a great starting point but I actually

00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:13,769
want to go further than that so what I

00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:15,989
found very painful we from through my

00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:18,509
own journey to acquire the Chinese

00:06:15,989 --> 00:06:20,789
script is that there's no digital data

00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:23,519
set that treats shapes as further or

00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:25,709
first-order citizens that describes

00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,599
character components and not just any

00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:30,300
components not not not the naive

00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:32,249
decompositions that you saw above but

00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,469
like the meaningful ones which also

00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:37,499
helped make sense of the writing system

00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:38,849
and which really annotate all of these

00:06:37,499 --> 00:06:40,949
components with their function in

00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:42,629
specific characters hey this contributes

00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:45,179
our pronunciation here hey this

00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:47,039
contributes some meaning or shape Oh in

00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:48,629
this particular character this is just a

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,360
distorted form of something else and it

00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:52,889
doesn't actually contribute anything so

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,990
I set out to

00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:58,800
create this data set myself famous last

00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:00,599
words right I will show you quickly the

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,060
tool that I built the Berg bench to

00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:04,979
annotate these characters I'm starting

00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,110
out from a bunch of resources which I

00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:10,139
combined which are available online and

00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,909
also all of this relevant information

00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:14,639
are available offline sources this is a

00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:17,120
scan from a book that I own this is Nate

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,379
Ricardo's book Chinese characters

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,919
wonderful book genealogy and dictionary

00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:25,650
and a couple of websites and more let me

00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:30,210
show you what the workbench itself looks

00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:31,770
like this is this is the tool there's a

00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:34,139
list of the characters on the Left

00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,879
arranged by frequency so this is the

00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:39,840
numbers here are ranks you have their

00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:41,819
pronunciation the main working area is

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,189
at the top I'll show you how that part

00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:47,039
works and all the extra information that

00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:49,680
I've gathered is here at the bottom so

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,539
what you can do is let me recreate part

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,990
of this character for instance so you

00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:56,669
start from a stage there you just have

00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:59,400
the strokes but they are not annotated

00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:02,849
in a different way so you can select the

00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:05,129
strokes on everything and these I say

00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:08,339
okay these together make up something

00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:10,409
meaningful in the character this is

00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:12,930
actually a component that contributes

00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:14,849
sound it is actually this other

00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,710
character and maybe I can even add a

00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:18,689
little bit of a hint or some additional

00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:20,639
explanation and this is how you go on

00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:22,259
and keep annotating all these different

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,729
characters you can see the green

00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:25,379
checkmarks those are ones that I've

00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:27,569
already finished if you scroll further

00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,460
down there are a whole lot which I

00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:32,010
haven't touched yet and you need a way

00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:34,289
to navigate this 9,000 items so you can

00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,000
just search or filter by pronunciation

00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:38,969
all the characters that sound like this

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,279
you can filter by structure I want to

00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:42,750
see the characters that according to the

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,149
current state of the annotation which

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:49,230
might or might not be correct contain

00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:51,779
this component and this is very I spend

00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:56,130
a lot of time just preparing these

00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:58,949
annotations back to my presentation what

00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,449
will the outcome be when I'm all done

00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:02,490
with all of this the outcome will be

00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:05,760
some sort of a structured file maybe

00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,450
Jason which has one unit per character

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,610
here's

00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:11,040
shadow character contains a section for

00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:13,170
The Strokes these are the SVG pass the

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,690
shapes some information about the

00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:19,500
character as a whole and then a list of

00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:22,980
the parts expressing in some combination

00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,270
of you know bit vectors flags what is

00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,400
the contribution is to contribute

00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,870
meaning meaning and sound etc there are

00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,650
about a dozen different possible

00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:34,320
combinations which strokes make up this

00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:35,880
element in the character and also what

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,940
is the code point if it is actually also

00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,130
a thing on its own and what are some of

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,200
the cool uses once you finally have such

00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:46,650
a correct data set I will show you two

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:49,860
of these I have a prototype for both so

00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:53,130
one is a network Explorer of the script

00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:57,210
basically what you can do is go to a

00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:59,070
character and get a graph like this with

00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:02,540
the character that I'm looking at in the

00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:05,850
center so I use d3.js for this animation

00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:08,870
and I see ok this shadow character is

00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:12,360
made up of this character and this

00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:14,490
shun patterns character by the way this

00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,190
other character also occurs in a whole

00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,090
bunch of third characters I am only

00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,160
showing

00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:22,260
always the top three most frequent ones

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,650
and I get the highlight like what they

00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:27,360
exactly contribute and of course you can

00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:29,460
also navigate this graph so you can

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,560
click on the Sun character that doesn't

00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,480
break down any further but it is part of

00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,330
all these other characters and then you

00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,490
can go to this one you also get a little

00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,780
bit of extra information verbally or

00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,640
more structured in the bottom left

00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:44,010
corner so I think this is just a really

00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,110
really cool way to present the Chinese

00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:49,920
script for what it is a network of

00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:52,410
interlocking parts the other tool it is

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,560
actually an iPhone app it's kind of

00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:57,180
difficult to share my iPhone screen I'm

00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,790
developing it in Cordoba so I'm showing

00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,830
the same app in my browser but just

00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,380
imagine this is an actual app running on

00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:07,260
an iPhone I can either paste a character

00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:09,090
or just draw it very often if you don't

00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,050
know what the character is it's really

00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:14,130
hard to type it so you need to draw it

00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:16,950
because we have the strokes we can

00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:19,250
easily build a handwriting recognizer

00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:21,800
which is what we have here

00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,450
there is my character this is the one

00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,310
that I showed you in the editor so this

00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:27,110
is what the outcome looks like in a nice

00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,300
human readable form with some

00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:31,250
explanations again here's the great

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,680
advantage that shapes are first-class

00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:35,450
citizens you can highlight whatever you

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,060
want and just leave the rest in gray

00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:41,210
this is all works automatically at the

00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:42,890
end row these things and of course you

00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:46,450
can also navigate this so you can go

00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:48,680
into this King character get its own

00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,150
decomposition and the really cool part

00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,950
is you don't just see the internal

00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:54,260
structure of specific characters you

00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:56,510
also see oh and this one is a sound

00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,580
component in these other ones which tend

00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:00,680
to sound like this and by the way it

00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:03,920
contributes some sort of a meaning in

00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:06,110
these other ones so you give this way

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,090
you can see each component in context

00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:12,170
and get a much clearer idea of its role

00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:14,060
in the writing system and basically

00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:16,100
that's what I wanted to show you I think

00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,990
it's really exciting but really huge

00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,020
project the one question that gives me

00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:23,240
occupy now is what is the best way to

00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:25,100
share a resource like this so far this

00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,750
is only private and with me I've never I

00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,310
never put something like this out into

00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,020
the world particularly not why they

00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:32,270
still work in progress if you've done

00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:34,580
something like this if you have ideas or

00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:37,040
any insights here do throw those my way

00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:39,700
along with any other questions and thank

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,700
