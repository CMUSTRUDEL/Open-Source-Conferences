	Obelisk and the Known Unknowns (Or: The Art of Fumbling Through your Side Project to Create Something Incredible!) by Sacha Sayan

I had a dream of building something cool in the realm of digital signage, no fabrication knowledge, questionable memory of high school physics equations, and a terrible track record for finishing side projects. So I did what anyone else would do: Pulled my credit card out to buy a bunch of undocumented electronics from an internet wholesaler and forced myself to sit down and figure it out. The result: Something amazing, and a deep reflection for how we should think about our pet projects.

When Sacha (@sachasayan) isn’t getting himself into trouble committing to side projects, he’s working as a software engineer in Toronto, Canada. In his spare time he also likes to get lost on motorcycles in far flung corners of the planet, demonstrating that he really is a masochist beyond redemption.

everyone um

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,920
as i was just introduced my name is

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,680
sasha and i am terrible at finishing

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,080
side projects um i'm never

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,039
able to finish them i don't know why but

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,920
it's something that i've always

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,400
struggled with

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,439
um but but a little while ago i started

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,920
geeking out on

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,640
you know one fixation in particular um

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,960
which is

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,719
signage um it's one of those ubiquitous

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,760
objects that we don't really think about

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,920
much in general like chairs like

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,520
i just wanted to create something with

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,600
signage

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,440
and i kind of came across um this

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,600
company uh called breakfast

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,039
in new york that they've been managed uh

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,920
they've been manufacturing

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,079
uh flipped oscar flip disc walls for art

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,680
installations um these are like the kind

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,879
of signs you would see in

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,120
in train stations um for schedules

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,640
um this is a piece by japanese artist

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,479
masaki yokobe

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,600
um i think he's using one of their walls

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,799
he doesn't actually document but i

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,520
believe he's using one of their walls it

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,520
looks like it

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,760
um and i just thought this was like a

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,400
phenomenal uh way of experimenting with

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,439
the medium

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,360
i wanted to make something like this um

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,960
but the problem is i have no clue where

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,320
to start with this i've never done any

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,159
fabrication before

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,600
the idea of taking on something that is

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,960
so totally out of my wheelhouse

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,280
sounded um impossible to me but

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,280
um for the past while i've been working

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,000
in project consulting and in that time

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,079
i've started

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,360
really geeking out on process helping

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,600
clients identifying

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,479
their road maps milestones and kind of

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,240
like how to

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,920
take on projects that really aren't in

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,560
their wheelhouses

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,680
and so i kind of knew that um i needed

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,680
an mvp

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,720
um and this is a story about how going

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,640
through that process

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,079
i kind of shaped my exploration of the

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,079
problem and ended up with

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,680
you know something a little unexpected

00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,759
um and something that i

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,000
didn't really think was a direction i

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,640
would go in when i started

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,479
so the first conclusion was that if i'm

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,319
going to take on this project

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,000
i know that my strengths are in software

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,680
and not hardware and that means i need

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,440
to reduce the hardware factor

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,200
and maybe learn a little bit about

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,920
hardware along the way

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,200
and after um a bunch of research i came

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,560
across the idea of using

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,920
uh led modules um these are the kinds of

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,400
modules that you would find

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,480
used on electronic billboards in places

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,640
like times square

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,400
what happens is they uh bolt a bunch of

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,959
these together

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,400
and they create these huge huge huge

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,200
displays with them they're completely

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,560
modular

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,400
um it turns out some there's some really

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,760
cool advantages from for these from a

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,519
hardware perspective

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,760
uh for one thing they're really bright

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,879
uh on average uh these panels

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,680
are about 6000 nits in brightness your

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,959
average uh computer monitor is about 300

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,319
to 500 nits

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,720
so these are somewhere on the order of

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,640
10 times as bright as a computer monitor

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,440
because they need to show up

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,040
bright in outdoor spaces and another

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,440
really cool advantage is that they have

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,640
a

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,640
unlimited um refresh rate um they

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,239
basically can update as fast as you want

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,200
them to update as long as your hardware

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,800
can support it

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,720
which means you're not limited to 60

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,879
hertz if you want to be doing something

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,560
in 240 frames per second you could be

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,000
doing that um

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,480
which you know it's it 90 hertz and 144

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,120
hertz

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,400
monitors are becoming uh popular now so

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,080
that's something that like if you've

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,760
experienced one of those you see that

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,319
the fluidity of those displays is

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,840
actually really really interesting um on

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,280
top of that they're not really

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,040
um high uh they don't have a high

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,560
resolution which can be seen as like a

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,360
detriment but also they have this really

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,040
great like

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,120
pixel aesthetic to them that we can kind

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,720
of play around with so i kind of really

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,200
like hooked onto this is something that

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,280
i could

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,560
play around with um so just a little bit

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,640
of background about these panels they're

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,879
essentially raw leds they have no

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,159
real intelligence behind them um as i

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,000
said they're used mostly in commercial

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,200
situations they're custom installations

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,720
done by professionals

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,799
they're generally controlled by

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,360
specialized hardware

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,200
um and they're generally aren't well

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,319
documented as a result

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,480
i don't know if it's just because the

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,120
manufacturers keep that documentation

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,400
close to their you know tests or it's

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,160
just that they don't have any reason to

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,120
publish that documentation i think it's

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,799
they just

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,239
generally don't think there's a public

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,520
desire for it

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,280
um but they are ubiquitous um

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,520
you've seen them in you know city

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,639
squares and on the sides of highways

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,080
and so an interesting thing is that

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,800
they're somewhat commoditized and you

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,560
can go online and buy these panels for

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,919
like 10 20 usd um which is really really

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,960
cheap for something that is

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,639
you know so flexible for us um and the

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,759
fact that they're commoditized and solo

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,440
level means that there's actually a

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,040
decent number of people on the internet

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,960
playing with them and in particular i

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,000
want to give a shout out to

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,160
henry zeller he's got this repository

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,160
going on github

00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,639
rpi rgb lead matrix it's a really really

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,840
in-depth repository of code and

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,680
schematics for

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,720
circuit boards to control these at a low

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,639
level using an arduino or a raspberry pi

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,560
um he's done some really fantastic work

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,039
and there's a lot of discussion going on

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,080
in this github repo it's a really really

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,680
invaluable

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,680
resource um so here's my plan

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,880
i'm gonna grab a bunch of these i'm

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,039
gonna strap them together

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,000
i'm going to hook them to a raspberry pi

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,160
i'm going to figure out a power

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,600
solution of my own um i'm going to

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,479
somehow mount them in a

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,160
in a cabinet um and i'm going to find a

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,400
way to make the entire thing interactive

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,759
oh and because i'm kind of screwing

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,080
around with this an experimental thing i

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,400
need

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,199
a finder i need to find a way to make uh

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,919
the software easily updateable

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,600
um now that i'm a crucial point in the

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,560
project i find myself taking stock of

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,120
the things i didn't

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,320
think i'd need to address or didn't know

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,000
that i would have to plan for

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,840
when i began and i think that's like an

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,160
interesting part of this

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,160
endeavor that i kind of want to focus on

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,000
um you really really need to be

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,840
aware of the low-level things when

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,120
you're working with these panels they

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,759
don't have any smarts

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,120
uh as part of them you need to be aware

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,280
of the length of time that you're

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,800
sending pulses of electricity

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,080
and that those match the capabilities of

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,759
your board because again your board is

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,720
not documented and these things are

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,479
measured in nanoseconds um these panels

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,520
are all multiplexed and really

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:24,240
kind of funny um uh

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,520
like interesting ways that it isn't just

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,199
like you're getting a straight

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:32,000
x and y row and column coordinates

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,639
um that's i believe it's to actually

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,880
prevent

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,560
the panels from showing from being

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,280
updated in

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,080
so that they're not really um how would

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,840
i say this

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,120
that there's not artifacts on the screen

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,479
so that they're

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,000
they're updated in odd ways um

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,080
and because it's hardware and low-level

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,199
hardware things generally don't fail

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,520
gracefully

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,199
um and i don't know how to debug off

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,000
hardware so this was like a really

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,880
um you know new struggle for me um this

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,039
particular

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,400
issue by the way was because i had a

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,960
failure in my

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,919
uh in one of my power cables and it

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,720
turns out that

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,319
even though uh even if you have your

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,880
signal coming in but your power

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,960
not coming in uh it turns out all your

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,720
red leds will still light up

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,160
because they are so low current that

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,440
they will actually still light up just

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,639
from the signal alone

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,840
um in just randomly um it kind of looks

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,880
like your panel is having

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,479
a seizure and the the blue and

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,080
green components won't light up but your

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,800
red ones will

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,160
um speaking of wiring wiring excuse me

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,240
speaking of wiring these actually have

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,880
significant power draw requirements

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,120
yes they're leds but you're looking at

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,400
for a 32 by 16 panel you're looking at

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,840
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,960
led components and each one of those

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,000
has an rg and a b sub component so

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,199
you're looking at

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,960
um typically uh upwards of 50 watts of

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,479
draw per panel which means that when i

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,160
was building a custom wiring harness

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,400
that meant i had to break out a solder i

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,680
sold an iron a voltmeter and a night of

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,840
research understanding

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,400
how not to burn my house down plugging

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,520
200 watts worth of undocumented uh

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,240
electronics from china into my wall

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,680
um and you know like with all we're all

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,280
at this point we haven't even gotten

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,680
into the software

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,199
um we always talk about kind of you know

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,400
just doing this little bit and that

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,080
little bit

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,680
but fundamentally this is a good

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,360
reminder that we're bad at assessing the

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,199
true scope of our work

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,400
an hour here and an hour there these

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,960
things add up

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,479
but that saved me because i kind of knew

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,479
that i needed an mvp

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,680
and more than that i needed a reliable

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,719
way to understand

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,800
risk enter the known unknowns

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,719
so the known unknowns are this tool that

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,240
um i kind of found out

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,560
first funnily enough i found out about

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,959
through uh an old donald rumsfeld quote

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,720
but

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:52,240
uh it's apparently a a a reasonably

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,080
popular tool within the intelligence

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,399
community used for assessing risk

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,600
in state actors i've been using it with

00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,760
uh clients at work

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,279
uh who've had trouble road mapping uh

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,519
their projects with pretty great

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,120
success and the idea is that rather than

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,800
assessing the um

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,320
difficulty or the amount of time that

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,440
we're going to spend on something we

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,399
categorize our roadmap

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,920
in terms of risk certainty so there's

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,959
four categories we have

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,959
the uh known unknowns sorry the no

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,120
knowns that's things that we know

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,360
uh fully determined we understand both

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,120
the problem and the solution

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,399
we have our unknown knowns those are

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,080
things that we don't know yet

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,680
that we know that is the things that we

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,760
are confident we have determined

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,680
solution for but we kind of under need

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,560
to understand better what that solution

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,440
is

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,279
um we have our unknown uh oh i think i

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,200
missed one of them

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,959
uh if i missed one of them there's four

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,120
there's the no knowns

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,320
uh the unknown knowns uh the known

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,600
unknowns those are the things that we

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,399
don't know the things that we don't have

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,000
a solution for

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,480
these things might need a period of

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,200
discovery and we have our unknown

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,600
unknowns

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,959
these are the things that we uh we don't

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,880
know that we don't know

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,560
not only do we not have a full solution

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,079
but we aren't able to fully articulate

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,800
the problem in the first place or how we

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,399
might approach

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,000
a solution um i think part of the reason

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,440
we get stuck on projects sometimes is

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,680
that we set ourselves up for these

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,720
little like micro traumas we attack our

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,279
known knowns

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,560
we know what we can do and so we just

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,000
focus on those things

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,079
without facing the reality of our

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,519
unknown unknowns at the end of the road

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,440
and if you're going to the grocery store

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,519
without even knowing how to get there

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,040
if the grocery store is open or they

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,079
have eggs you're gonna quickly

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,839
become debilitated when you're like i

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,040
thought this was gonna be simple but you

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,240
know it turns out there were a bunch of

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,079
unknown unknowns

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,920
um that i should have been taking into

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,800
account and these are the things that

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,320
discourage us as

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,680
we dig further into our side projects

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,560
and these are the things that stalemate

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,959
us

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,839
so um if we think of our problem space

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,320
as a set of

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,920
knowns and um known unknowns we have a

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,680
direct set of implied actions for every

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,279
challenge we see on the horizon

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,440
if we know our unknown unknowns

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,760
represent high risk we must make them a

00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,680
known quantity or get rid of them

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,200
so get rid of them

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,720
in particular i want to give an example

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,399
from this project which was the problem

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
of working on control i wanted to make

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,959
this

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,760
interactive so when it came to the idea

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,519
of

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,200
integrating controllers i kind of had

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,320
this thought of okay so i want to hook

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,560
up controllers

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,399
do i go usb do i go bluetooth that means

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,560
i need to get the drivers installed

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,600
oh the um the linux the bluetooth stack

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,200
is a is a mess

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,200
i'm running everything on node so i need

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,320
to use a node pid package but it's not

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,399
very well supported

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,160
and i'm on raspbian which you know has

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,880
kind of got like this niche

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,360
um driver situation and i looked into

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,120
using these xbox controllers that i had

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,800
in my closet and it turns out they don't

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,040
really work well at all

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,079
um for any pc they're kind of using

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,480
their proprietary

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,440
signal and it's just like it it was a

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,120
bunch of

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,200
unknowns that i couldn't how do i even

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,920
handle those connections um what happens

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,360
then

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,360
if i end up exhibiting this thing in

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,240
public how do i prevent controllers from

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,279
getting stolen

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,000
or damaged and fortunately i knew i

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,040
needed an

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,959
mvp um and the answer was right in front

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,800
of me i'm a software developer i work on

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,079
web projects all the time and i'm

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,200
already running my panel

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,000
um and all my scripts in node i could

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,880
just sprint up

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,480
an express server on the raspberry pi so

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,720
that's what i did

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,560
um have users provide their own phones

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,519
as controllers and communicate via

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,200
web websockets and everything kind of

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,720
fell into place from there

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,120
um so this is obelisk uh oops

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,320
i'm gonna make sure it's running um it

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,519
is uh

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,839
exactly what i've been telling you it's

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,800
a bunch of uh these panels

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,600
um on a raspberry pi running an express

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,519
server

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,120
on node express is serving a react

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,920
client application

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,800
and that client application is

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,000
communicating

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,680
with the server to allow me to rapidly

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,120
prototype new ideas and switch between

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,839
them at different times so

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,160
you know if i've got something i want to

00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,560
do

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,360
at a specific moment i can just add that

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,760
to this

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,760
um to both the client and the server and

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,160
control both of those things

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,399
each person that connects gets a new

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,560
slot assigned to them on the server

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,320
and um we solve the problem of

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,800
controllers getting lost or damaged

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,720
um every phone so the client actually

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,959
has controllers on its side

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,880
and when you go into something like pong

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,480
you're the server requests that you open

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,240
up the pawn controller which you then

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,320
can control with your phone

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,680
and it gives us unlimited possibilities

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,440
for interaction we don't even have to

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,680
use the screen we could hook into web

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,440
apis like device orientation or web

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,160
audio we could create our own little

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,760
version of

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,279
like a wii controller with our phones

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,560
that are controlled on this screen

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,720
you know this gives us so many

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,320
possibilities and for the more this is

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,760
reduces the cost of the project now i

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,839
don't even need to take into account

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,360
controllers i just have the panels which

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,519
we've already

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,760
established are pretty cheap and

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,839
everyone brings their own phone

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,920
so it gives us a lot of you know

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,040
possibilities to play with

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,199
um so you know i'm notoriously bad at

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,240
finishing finishing my projects

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,800
but um now that i'm comfortable with

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,320
hardware

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,279
and i've got a clear path forward for

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,480
interactions and i've defined these mvps

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,320
um it kind of you know says to me

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,160
building a flip dot display doesn't seem

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,800
like so much of an unknown unknown

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,079
to me um thanks for listening my

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,399
presentation

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,399
if you're interested in checking out the

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,320
code for this i have it up at github

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,920
i've also got a small guide as to what

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,360
you would need to

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,920
do to get involved in this kind of

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,920
project this is the url i'll post it

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,920
in the chat later thanks a bunch cheers

00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,920
