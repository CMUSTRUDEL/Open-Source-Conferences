good morning everyone thank you Amy I

00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:05,910
resonate a lot with a lot of your

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,490
observations what I'd like to do today

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,920
is really talk in the broadest sense of

00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,360
the digital transformation the

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,240
Vodafone's undergoing because in a lot

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,670
of ways the network transformation is

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,340
just a part of that it's fundamentally

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,470
altering from the hardware constructs

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,480
that we've been to a software and

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,449
eventually to a data construct in the

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,769
future so as we work for our customers

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,610
and really figure out how do we deliver

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:35,160
the world's best gigabit network in the

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,920
digital first environment and really

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,079
looking quite quite constructively at

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,450
our at our past and our future and

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,430
saying it must be much simpler and as I

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,620
talked through today we'll highlight a

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,260
few areas where we've proactively and

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,719
fairly aggressively gone after

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,899
simplicity really just because we

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,070
recognize that our customers

00:00:53,899 --> 00:01:00,629
increasingly declare that they will

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:02,940
happily swap out speed and immediacy for

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:06,290
the complexity and robustness that we

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:09,990
might have prioritized it in past times

00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:11,640
to embrace not just a 5g transformation

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,860
but everything that's happening in the

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,200
digitalization of the world and bringing

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,180
everything online we continue like

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,450
everyone else in this room to embrace or

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,549
to be faced with how do you drive the

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,100
capacities and scales that actually

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:28,979
cause us to implement our entire

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,920
capacity over and over again year after

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:34,710
year again to keep up with scale growth

00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,049
but actually do so and crush the cost on

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,210
a per unit of bandwidth so we can

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,970
continue to bring on the solutions that

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,000
our customers need and ultimately the

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,229
most important thing is the

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,509
transformation to all digital so that

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:50,850
everything is available in our customers

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,560
hands the moment they want it and in the

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,909
future before they realize that they

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,770
want it is really what we're trying to

00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,619
accomplish going forward so that our

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,530
first our first focus is the customer

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,180
experience okay now I'd like to

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,250
highlight just a few of the things and

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,500
where we stand today and then talk about

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,690
how we've gotten there okay we don't

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,310
often come out and share kind of where

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,750
we are in the journey but I'd like to

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,709
take just a couple of moments to reflect

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,000
on

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:17,280
what we've done I think one of the

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,049
things that we we targeted two or three

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,120
years ago as we said to make this happen

00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:25,069
it's actually quite straightforward to

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:28,530
do this on a instance by instance basis

00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:31,260
but to move the entirety of our customer

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,269
base onto a software-defined software

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,099
software controlled infrastructure is

00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:36,930
actually much harder and the way to do

00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:39,000
that is not by going after the nice use

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,670
cases but to actually go after our

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,739
primary businesses so we put an early on

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,810
focus of innovating in our services

00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:48,989
businesses we built our new TV platform

00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:52,409
as we scaled our IOT platform as we

00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:55,950
transform to volte as we built 5g all of

00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:59,370
that has been migrating customers to the

00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:01,169
virtualized infrastructure okay we would

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,700
have migrated to cloud but as you know

00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:04,290
we're not there yet and the stock will

00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,659
cover just a bit of that but ultimately

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:09,329
this is an important step to it and

00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:12,000
we'll talk just a bit more about it we

00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:14,489
have built and really hats off to my

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,439
operations and delivery teams they've

00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:19,889
built in partnership with our vendors a

00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:21,989
huge infrastructure where we're now in

00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:24,769
excess of 30 percent of our network

00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:27,419
functions industrialised into the cloud

00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:30,510
by the end of our fiscal year we'll be

00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:32,729
in excess of 50 percent and these are

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,760
the crown jewels of the operations that

00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:39,479
Vodafone the packet core the voice core

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,250
etc in one of our largest countries

00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:43,560
we're actually passing we actually have

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:46,579
implemented in our passing traffic at

00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,590
capacities in excess of six terabytes

00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:52,739
across virtualized infrastructure which

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,689
is a just more than twice what we ever

00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:57,030
passed on our traditional and it

00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:58,799
continues to hum along as well and we do

00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,049
it in a unified fashion such that we

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,849
serve all customers seamlessly on that

00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:04,889
hybrid world because it's never the case

00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:08,040
that you get to build Greenfield when

00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:10,979
you have scale like ours okay and then

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,509
as I said before 5g non stand-alone as

00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:14,970
we've launched this summer across six

00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:17,579
countries has all been launched on

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:20,549
virtualized infrastructure as we move

00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:22,860
forward into 5g standalone in the near

00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:25,110
future we're expecting and counting on

00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,479
our vendors to have built that in cloud

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,630
native and so we've got a lot of work to

00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:28,920
do

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,440
to make sure that our infrastructure

00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:34,980
scales the physical the virtual and the

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,140
cloud in a consistent way okay and that

00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,820
the automation that we build actually

00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,680
automates end-to-end across that because

00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,660
our customers don't want to know and we

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,030
don't want them to know about the

00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,360
underlying piping okay so that's where

00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:50,190
we are today but how we got there has

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,410
been a bit of a journey and I'd like to

00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,850
spend a little bit of time because it

00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,860
calls out that we're actually going to

00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,350
insist on what I say we're good we need

00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,300
to do in the future okay so we started

00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:03,800
like everyone else in the room probably

00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,670
with any we have the luxury of

00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,580
experimenting and inventing across

00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:10,410
numerous countries and so what we did is

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,330
we actually had different interests and

00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,270
priorities in each country driving

00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,890
different virtualization strategies but

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,990
what that let us do is that let us

00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:21,240
actually validate for almost every

00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,950
network function that we could

00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,160
virtualize that develop of the operating

00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:29,700
processes and really confirm that that

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,590
strategy would work and end ok then we

00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,390
said wait a minute

00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:34,950
doing these siloed implementations is

00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,480
not going to take us at all where we

00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,400
want to it's not going in fact it's

00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,040
probably going to add more cost will add

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,930
more complexity so that's when we backed

00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,690
up and we said we need to simplify quite

00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:49,740
quite significantly and so we went from

00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:52,830
a very multi vendor centric to a much

00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,800
more homogenized domain-specific area

00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:58,860
where we went after from best of Best of

00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,740
Breed to best of Sweden and we would

00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:05,430
actually build aggregates especially

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:09,330
around our big complex vnfs of the IMS

00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:11,520
and of the PC and as we went then to

00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:14,520
build scale we industrialized

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,990
working predominantly with VMware we

00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,600
industrialized the vim the

00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:21,960
infrastructure management and then we

00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:24,270
put in place the best of suite solutions

00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,640
around packet core and voice core that

00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:28,320
led us build scale and as I like to

00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,440
think of it that secured the business

00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,480
case right that let us get more savings

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,240
but more importantly that let us finally

00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,910
build scale operations to really drive

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,600
the transformation without holding

00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,700
ourselves hostage to the world

00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,550
we talked about now a virtual is of

00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,590
automation and beyond ok so where we

00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:49,150
stand now is with the majority of our

00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:52,420
travel with nearly the majority of our

00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:54,130
traffic in we're now at a place where we

00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,050
need where we've got the scale that

00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:59,140
demands and requires that we now

00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,790
automate ok and so we're very much at

00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,470
the part of our journey that Amy talked

00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:06,850
about in terms of moving to true

00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:08,350
automation where we actually have the

00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:10,540
scale in scale out that we've always

00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,370
dreamed about but more importantly we

00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:14,680
have that working in a cohesive fashion

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:17,350
and a service creating fashion that lets

00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,680
us innovate and drive more services to

00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:22,840
our customers in a faster way

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,450
streamlining because we've chosen to

00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,770
simplify ok and there are some really

00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:30,070
important things that we need to get to

00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:33,940
our next steps what that then will set u

00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:36,100
8 us for is to be able to now that we

00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:39,340
have automation telemetry and most

00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,780
importantly control that then lets us

00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,640
bring in some of the work that we've

00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,500
been doing in our digital arena and in

00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,200
our more traditional ops teams of

00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:51,190
bringing in the machine learning the

00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,990
automation as well as the predictive to

00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:55,960
be able to finally build the automation

00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,700
side of it to move us to an earning

00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,340
approach and an insights driven approach

00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,900
to how we scale our operation serve our

00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:04,150
customers and so forth so that's where

00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:07,000
we are with our next steps coming then

00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:14,560
and after the automation folding in the

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:18,280
learning ok ok now we've built also in

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,990
parallel quite a substantial digital

00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,330
capability in terms of how we serve our

00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,390
customers a lot of it was achieved by

00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:27,550
moving from our internal private cloud

00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:30,190
into the public cloud for a lot of our

00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:34,240
applications and we were in fact one of

00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:35,560
if not the only carrier that actually

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,450
went through the iPhone launch and

00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:40,479
continued to keep up with scale in this

00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:42,789
last iteration because we've relied on

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,040
and built on the solutions available to

00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:48,340
us in the public cloud okay because

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,020
we've embraced the DevOps tooling we've

00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:53,280
now been able to automate and we're

00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,470
releasing fixes improvements and

00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,500
accelerators

00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:00,020
into our code base on a daily basis now

00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,000
these are things that we've seen our

00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:04,010
competitors do for some time but is

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,560
quite quite remarkable to finally see

00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:08,930
our own developers taking these controls

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,190
in hand and being able to tailor the

00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,220
services that we deliver to our

00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:15,830
customers and we're beginning to see

00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:18,470
some really compelling use cases of

00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:20,900
integrating learning and analytics right

00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:25,400
most of our customer offers today are

00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:27,440
now made not by our market ears but by

00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,720
the customization of our machine

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,260
learning on top of the best capabilities

00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:37,490
of our market ears okay and then lastly

00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:39,800
we've built reuse of our chat bot

00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,960
applications and others by finally

00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:45,230
standardizing on our digital experience

00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:47,750
link library which which is our API

00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:50,210
layer for our digital and that's really

00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:52,250
giving us confidence to push for the

00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:54,350
simplification and streamlining through

00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:56,540
adoption of common api's into the

00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:58,370
network space as well so these are some

00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,430
of the proof points that actually have

00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:03,700
seemed obvious for quite some time but

00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:06,170
for whatever reason we've resisted and

00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:09,770
now we begin to see actually it's

00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:12,020
driving huge change and big improvements

00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:14,960
in terms of how our customers work with

00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:17,750
and secure services from Vodafone that

00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,970
gives us confidence now to push into how

00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,520
do we address the critical challenges

00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:24,440
that we face right because one of the

00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,870
hardest things that we are confronted

00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:30,650
with today is what we've industrialized

00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:32,960
and are working and scaling it is still

00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:35,720
the case that if you look at how we've

00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,940
onboard Adar via Neffs it still looks

00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:41,660
too much like an artisan activity and

00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:43,580
not an industrial activity okay it is

00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:46,130
still too much the case as you would

00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:48,920
expect of us we require that each of our

00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:51,680
vnf providers commit to delivering a

00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,660
certain scale throughput performance and

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,870
availability off of a given

00:10:53,660 --> 00:11:00,500
infrastructure right seems reasonable to

00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:03,140
make the shift what we didn't or what we

00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,480
underestimated was then the requirement

00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,670
that that would place on them to want to

00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,420
get into the details of the underlying

00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,910
hardware

00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:14,930
and software assets and configuration of

00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:16,880
the vim etc so we look at how do we

00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:19,550
actually do that in an automated world

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,470
where we need to bring in software

00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:24,500
updates potentially on a monthly or

00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:26,360
weekly basis bring in new services

00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,270
onboard new elements move to the edge

00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:32,000
right none of these things will happen

00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:34,850
well in an artisan world right it will

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,640
be beautiful but it will be slow it will

00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:39,950
work but it will be too expensive okay

00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,500
and so it's really important that we

00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:44,840
work through how do we industrialize and

00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,360
as we learned in terms of how did we

00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,070
industrialize the implementation of

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,470
virtualization across the breadth of

00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,420
services that we offer we expect we'll

00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:56,720
have to proactively simplify so we

00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,820
welcome the activities that the rest of

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,410
the industry is banding with us in C NTT

00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,840
and other activities to really help

00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:04,970
drive that simplicity and the

00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,430
consistency right because you look at

00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:08,930
companies like AWS and why are they so

00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,420
successful is because they essentially

00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:13,550
hang out the placard and say build to

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,220
this and I'll guarantee that you get the

00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:17,690
performance right we need to have the

00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,300
equivalent and that's what we're trying

00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,110
to do okay and we'll talk just a bit

00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,350
more about that

00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:27,050
the vnf support of network orchestration

00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:29,330
we never imagined that the last thing to

00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:31,570
actually emerge would have been the way

00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:33,950
to talk from the vnf to the orchestrator

00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:36,320
okay but in fact that's where we are

00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:38,690
we've had orchestration strategies

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,360
funding and everything else sat ready to

00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:43,070
go and then we find we actually have to

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,760
foster a lot of collaboration between

00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:48,590
Orchestrator vendor and vnf vendor and

00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:52,430
by the way also when it's the same

00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:55,490
company that you do that in an open and

00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:58,010
consistent way okay so driving the Etsy

00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:59,870
interfaces around Seoul X through five

00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:03,200
and so forth making sure that we've got

00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:07,070
everything that we need in terms of that

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:10,340
linkage between VN f VN FM &

00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:11,930
Orchestrator has come much much later in

00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:15,740
the game than I had expected but we have

00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:17,570
to drive it okay and then lastly we've

00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:20,520
spent far far too long in the

00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:22,530
virtualization world okay

00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:25,170
the cloud native world is moving at a

00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:27,990
pace that we can hardly imagine and we

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:29,280
haven't in fact begun to industrialize

00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:33,300
and move in that direction as an

00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:34,590
industry okay and why why is cloud

00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,330
native going to be important to us

00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:38,670
because in fact cloud native is the

00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:41,520
first assurance that we have of the

00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:44,730
ability to scale of the ability to fully

00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:47,070
automate but most importantly of being

00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:49,440
able to distribute the application space

00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:53,910
into whichever geography that we want

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,410
and we're quite interested and insistent

00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:58,890
on that because what we see is that

00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:01,680
unlocks the edge okay and the edge for

00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:05,160
us may not be as distributed or as many

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,350
as others but what we do believe is it's

00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:12,570
a new era in telecommunications when we

00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:15,840
offer guaranteed Layton sees at less

00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:17,970
than 10 milliseconds okay when we offer

00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:21,750
the ability of applications to be

00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:24,390
real-time in the truest sense okay and

00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:27,120
when we can do so at scale and at pace

00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:29,070
because we've automated and without

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,090
cloud native I question whether or not

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:33,720
we can get there

00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:35,880
it is almost certainly impossible for us

00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,670
to get to the layers of to the level of

00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:41,190
reliability and consistency of

00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:44,270
availability that we would need to get

00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:47,850
to without cloud native as well okay now

00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:50,280
three challenges if we solve these three

00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:53,040
I think we're well on our way if not 90%

00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:56,270
of the way there okay and I don't think

00:14:53,040 --> 00:15:00,180
I've over simply I'm oversimplifying the

00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:03,600
solution space for us it comes down to

00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:05,910
some important design choices some

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,700
critical collaborations it's not enough

00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:12,000
for anyone regardless of scale to simply

00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,350
declare we have to partner with this we

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,680
have to partner with our vendors and

00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:18,450
with the other carriers around the world

00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,890
to make sure that we can get to where we

00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:22,860
need to get to in terms of streamlining

00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:25,100
our own infrastructure and this is a

00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,790
hard nut to get over sometimes because

00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,160
infrastructure is something that we've

00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:31,610
never had to collaborate on and in fact

00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,110
we fought over it and competed with it

00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:35,880
historically okay

00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:38,670
and this is why we also invest quite a

00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:41,760
bit of hope and expectation around the

00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:44,490
CNT tea initiative so I ask everyone in

00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,260
the room to please embrace help us find

00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,090
out what's shortcoming still in it but

00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:50,670
let's find a way to solve it because as

00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:52,230
with the decision we find that the

00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:55,470
decision that we took about three years

00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:57,840
ago to move from best of breed to best

00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:01,110
of sweet has brought us in integration

00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,850
tasks that was actually manageable we're

00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:05,340
looking at what we're doing in terms of

00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:07,830
how do we scale and when you look

00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:11,750
especially down the road towards a now

00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:13,980
clout refactored into cloud native vnf

00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:16,530
without having a higher degree of

00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:19,800
consistency and stability there is

00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:22,530
almost no way that we will be able to

00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,390
operationalize either the infrastructure

00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:26,430
or the services but maybe more

00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:29,100
importantly we question whether or not

00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:31,410
the vnf vendors can actually have any

00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,630
type of reliable business model or

00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:35,540
ability to deliver so long as each of us

00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:39,090
give them a very specific different

00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:41,520
deployment target okay maybe that's what

00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:43,110
amazon taught us above all it was all

00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,730
frustrating in the earliest days of

00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:47,970
Amazon because you only gave what they

00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:49,830
you only got what they gave but in

00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:51,060
reality that turns out to be a blessing

00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,430
if you look at the diversity of

00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,930
innovation that they've spawned and so

00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,430
now maybe we as telco can learn

00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,590
something from that and with the

00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:02,190
reference architectures and patterns of

00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:06,089
see NTT deliver similar simplicity okay

00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:08,490
we have to get consistent in terms of

00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:09,449
what is the standard that we require of

00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,699
the vnfs

00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:14,850
and what is the standard that we will

00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:17,400
require also of the orchestrators okay

00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:19,199
one of the things that has been quite

00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,330
surprising to me is how many times I've

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,820
actually had to really urge coerced

00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:26,100
demand whatever you want to describe it

00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:28,830
what I thought was quite simple which is

00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,810
if a via an offender you have to work

00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,150
with multiple orchestrators if an

00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:35,490
Orchestrator you have to orchestrate

00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:38,370
multiple vnfs seems really

00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:40,710
straightforward but we aren't yet there

00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:44,220
so a lot of work has to come and really

00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:46,020
driving the etsy interfaces but

00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,000
remembering actually all of this is

00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:50,700
irrelevant unless we can actually in

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,200
- great - the service layer above us so

00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,270
actually bringing in now

00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,870
interoperability in our case with TMF

00:17:54,270 --> 00:18:00,960
okay but if I can have anything please

00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:03,300
it is that set of Etsy interfaces that

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,550
let my Orchestrator and my vnf stock in

00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:08,490
the consistent way super super simple

00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:10,260
but it's stunning when you look at

00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:13,380
roadmaps how far out sometimes they are

00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:20,370
so please bring those roadmaps in ok and

00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:21,840
then lastly while I said before I may

00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:24,000
not have made the point well enough if

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,420
the building scale stage was really

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,210
landing the business case the automation

00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:35,070
stage is what lands the customer

00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:37,740
experience and until we have that

00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:41,490
customer experience that is born out of

00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:44,640
full automation cloud native immediacy

00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:46,410
real-time telemetry ability then to

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,180
expose the whole thing to the power of

00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:51,420
machine learning for optimization

00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:53,970
tailoring and prediction we will

00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:56,910
struggle to serve our customers as well

00:18:53,970 --> 00:19:00,410
as they require it right the hyper

00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:03,960
scalars has have done a fantastic job of

00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:06,750
raising the bar to our customers and we

00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:10,080
live it right each of us in the room is

00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:12,600
a product of that as well and we as

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,610
telco carriers and service providers

00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,670
have to be much more aggressive at

00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:19,560
driving all the way through to the point

00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:23,190
that actually the insights of our

00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:26,130
customers optimize our networks it's no

00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:28,650
longer an engineering task it now

00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:30,270
becomes an automation task and that is

00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:34,260
what cloud native will enable us to

00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:38,070
become while driving availability cost

00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:39,630
and reliability so would really

00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:41,040
appreciate everyone's help to help us

00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:43,380
get these three things addressed because

00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:45,160
then I think we begin to finally fly

00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:49,989
thank you

00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,989
