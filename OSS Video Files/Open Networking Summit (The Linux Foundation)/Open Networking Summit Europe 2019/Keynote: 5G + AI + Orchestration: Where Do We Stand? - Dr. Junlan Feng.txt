	Keynote: 5G + AI + Orchestration: Where Do We Stand? - Dr. Junlan Feng, Chief Scientist, China Mobile Research Institute

5G is commercially available for certain regions and is on the fastest way to serve globally. Does 5G need to be orchestrated? Should 5G be operated and orchestrated intelligently? Where do we stand now? In this talk, we will address these questions in the context of 2019, the first year of the 5G Era.  Possible solutions will be offered and discussed.

thank you I was saying to the last a

00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:09,210
keynote and do you know how many talks

00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:15,690
already prefer this one and there's a

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:18,930
conference over a hundred and I have

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:23,880
learned a lot from the keynote talks and

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:26,699
the technical talks from talked from the

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,550
demos so I first really want to say

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:33,780
thank you I learned a lot the inside

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,510
said ideas the details and I also also

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,770
take this chance to thank

00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:45,239
lfn and the local organizers for having

00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:48,960
such nice event as a spot but I come for

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:52,770
honest honest but I think I come for

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,949
something nicer chocolate I'm a

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:58,079
chocolate collector so if anyone

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:02,789
interests in chocolate we definitely can

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:07,939
talk after this it's just so nicer when

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:11,100
I add the chocolate to the OS template

00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:16,409
make it the 5ga orchid situation look

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:21,360
nicer cute and are the animals and in

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:23,610
the Coco's and it just kill lovely so I

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,240
don't exactly know what I should I

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,549
covered is a the last one and at the

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,150
time when I prepare my slides I didn't

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:35,759
know what other talks would be so to be

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:42,420
safe so I put all the terms on the

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:45,750
screen 5ga Ayaka situation and so talk

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,460
about 5g on china mobile walk all the

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,360
operators are probably in the world

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:55,049
alpha 5g available in 2019 this is our

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,079
offering 5g to be available commercially

00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:00,719
available for 50 cities major cities in

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,659
2018 you might try to look at there

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,670
where the red dots are you don't need to

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,950
worry I guess all the cities in this

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,470
room probably as a community you have

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,569
visited and you are visiting and you

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:15,459
will wizard I guess it's all covered

00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:19,239
the major cities will be available as

00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:22,389
always China Mobile does we offer more

00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:25,209
than we promised I guess if you go to

00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:30,879
China a rural place you got 5g in this

00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:33,849
year and don't be super surprised and 5t

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,519
plus and i don't know why in the recent

00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:39,629
couple years we all just not just the

00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:43,269
tech oh we all just love this sign plus

00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:45,669
I've in the back to you in June this

00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:50,260
year the top officers from t-mobile

00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:51,269
announced the r5 g plus strategy 5g plus

00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,699
plan

00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:57,129
now a few calculations if you're good at

00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:59,290
math and depends on who taught you math

00:02:57,129 --> 00:03:01,120
you may learn your math from your art

00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:04,090
teacher humanity teacher you get a

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:08,500
different answer so first one is the 5 g

00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:10,120
+ 4g we have 5g available above long

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,930
period of time and we know we're going

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:20,620
to operate the network of 5g plus 40 and

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:22,840
we need to find out the best way to have

00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:26,400
both together and to offer the top

00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:30,359
equality network for our customer and

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,040
the second one is 5g plus five letters

00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:34,930
they're just not simple letters it means

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,509
the serious business means where we're

00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:43,989
going to put our investments on AI CDE a

00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:47,139
means artificial intelligence AI means

00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:51,159
and Internet of Things cloud computing

00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:58,000
see Big Data and edge I don't think we

00:03:51,159 --> 00:04:00,040
miss anything big with all those great

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,739
technologies that coming up I think it's

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:07,810
important to have you know have a 5 g or

00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:11,680
networker to be more innovative we can

00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:15,400
do way more innovative with 5 g + these

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,430
technologies and each letter means

00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,829
something pretty big i will not not

00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,900
going to cover all of them but will open

00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:25,389
up the a part the artificial

00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:28,529
intelligence what we have done and a way

00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:28,529
what we have in mind

00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:34,610
the ecosystem not you know 5g is not a

00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:37,790
lie business we're gonna cheery empower

00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:41,420
ourselves we're gonna also support the

00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:43,850
how we can now post a ecosystem between

00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:48,140
empower other industry sectors among

00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:51,220
them there are nine major industry

00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,510
sectors we strategically invest in I

00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,540
just

00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:59,740
examples are finance manufacturing smart

00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:02,290
city transportation education

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,900
agriculture

00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:09,740
nyah-nyah of them and we have we did a

00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:14,990
reorg have organizations and dedicate to

00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:17,750
put a 5g for those industry sectors okay

00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:21,410
with a big big picture talk about now we

00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:27,650
come to 5g plus a artificial

00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:30,320
intelligence lasts onus I talked about a

00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:33,340
little bit of what we have done for

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:37,669
artificial intelligence but now we

00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:42,110
announced the platform the engine called

00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:45,530
Jogia means the highs the heaven or the

00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:47,930
ninth heaven it's come from a very

00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:51,410
well-known Chinese poetry and and you're

00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:56,270
gonna see how that pole she looks like

00:05:51,410 --> 00:06:00,230
so pretty much we we're trying to apply

00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:05,180
AI for a major five major areas in the

00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:10,850
business customer service marketing

00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:12,710
management security and network so we

00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:16,010
collectively with Beauty to platform

00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:19,460
we're unifying our internal AI efforts

00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:23,030
to be a same platform provide a

00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:24,830
computation power data computing and

00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:28,220
networking environment to algorithm

00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:34,000
solutions we also use this platform to

00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:34,000
enable other industries and

00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:39,539
took a few applications you know from

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:42,569
the last conference to this one that

00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:44,490
passed a couple months a few larger

00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:48,330
scale applications that were delivered

00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:50,460
to the the business value I think he's a

00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:55,710
larger skill to just give a couple

00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:59,370
examples for the management we applied

00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:05,610
natural language processing and and data

00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:09,539
analytics into auditing the invoices and

00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:12,210
the paperwork and our formal contracts

00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:18,330
and we also apply the conversation ing

00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:20,310
on our Oasis tum' and a few other

00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:24,689
smaller and about really fun ones I'm

00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:29,639
not going to cover here and for the

00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:31,469
marketing we put a quite lots of effort

00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,169
C and working on the recommendation

00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:38,900
technology or apply that to you draw our

00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:41,819
home TV service that really helped a lot

00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:47,039
improve our user experience improve our

00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:50,909
in our revenue and we also enable our

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,889
business to serve a few hundreds of

00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:59,939
hospitals using our conversation our

00:07:52,889 --> 00:08:02,849
agent and customer service this one I

00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:06,180
mentioned last time we have Chobot so we

00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:09,620
have the routing call routing agent we

00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:12,529
have the back-office lots of smaller

00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:15,770
tools put into the customer care

00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:18,120
back-office that really drive down the

00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:21,029
customer care costs and that's why we

00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:24,149
can offer really lower they to use

00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:28,699
digital rate if our customers and the

00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:34,010
hard ones are the network and security

00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:37,649
so I we have the put out a few

00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:40,699
applications into network to hear a list

00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:46,019
the one example basically it's using

00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:48,840
natural language technology speech

00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:51,720
recognition and the Plus

00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:55,500
machine learning - for the decision make

00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:58,020
and when you when we here customer call

00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,970
us to complain certain problem we're

00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,880
going to have to you know dive in to

00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:05,190
find out what was the how we can solve

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,100
for this problem that takes a long

00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:11,940
process to hear the message and in

00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:14,610
transcribed to certain texts we have to

00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:18,840
extract certain information from then we

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:22,950
have to have someone who really with a

00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:27,570
lot of network maintenance experience to

00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:29,280
go into to check into public over twenty

00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,080
different databases in support of the

00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,070
data to analyze what was the problem

00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:37,080
basically we collectively

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:39,810
combine these technologies and you

00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,330
automate this process the efficiency got

00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:47,520
improved ninety percent to save quite a

00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:51,180
lot some money for the company there are

00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:55,680
a few others and by just examples give

00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:58,140
you for the security now security can be

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,580
for information security for networking

00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:05,070
security just give one example how we

00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:08,160
help our customer to fight the the

00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:11,730
spamming phone calls because nowadays

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,620
not only you have a human call you to

00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:16,980
try to sell you something you have lots

00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:19,890
of robots call you so we put out the

00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:23,220
technology for speech using speech

00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:27,480
recognition using speaker identification

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:30,570
and base and plus the data analytics

00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:34,820
analytics trying to detect which caused

00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:39,000
our Swami phone cause that was the only

00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:45,870
Central TV one of the popular program in

00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:49,800
China in back to August I mentioned we

00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:51,870
hosted a nationwide a competition and we

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,690
have two one for smart family the other

00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:58,800
one for network we have close to 400

00:10:54,690 --> 00:11:02,230
teams join the competition and the final

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,930
the forty top performing ones are select

00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:07,230
the first second run after this trip

00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:10,390
after go back to China we will have the

00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:13,840
final competition will have two topics

00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:16,330
so we gave the data network a data flow

00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:22,120
prediction a while as the Fox you to

00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:23,950
co-sign on analytics just I know several

00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,960
companies here are involved as some

00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:28,090
developers are here also thank you for

00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,880
the work I really will push up

00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:34,560
we will push ahead the accuracy and in

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:39,460
the performance and technology and

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:42,550
orchestration this is a big thing for

00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:44,950
the community for own up and what we're

00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:48,460
going to orchestrate I mean what our

00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:53,410
consideration means for 5g and we have

00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:55,300
the NSA network as a slicing and you can

00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,520
look at the horizontal line and the

00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,230
vertical line there are way more things

00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,930
that we can arcus true you can orchestra

00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:05,380
being of SDN network a service is

00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:09,730
slicing that can turn out in the field

00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:11,710
and a and rampart for the orchid

00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,840
situation and we needed to do it across

00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:18,730
vendors we need across domains across

00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:20,800
layers so if our situation was the

00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:23,260
option for 5g I don't think it's

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,730
optionally anymore for 5g cuz the

00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:29,380
service offer will be way more

00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:31,990
complicated and we opened up they in the

00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:36,160
bottom infrastructure has changed so I'm

00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:39,100
thinking arc attrition is important for

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,500
5g is not an option anymore the no

00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:45,990
matter the depth and breadth for Lucas

00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:50,080
what would anarchist tree so it's life

00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:54,190
good now we have 5 g nai you can exit

00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:57,510
rate 5 g you can use AI to further help

00:12:54,190 --> 00:13:02,230
5 G and we can put all things together

00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:05,710
but I want to seriously talk a few

00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:10,510
questions I think we still needs to work

00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:13,300
huh I come when I look at the owners

00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:15,410
page at the schedule we have more than

00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:18,350
10 talks

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,790
ai or athletes the matching eye upon

00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:27,190
different taste the different flavor of

00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:32,420
different parts of AI what you know is

00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:35,020
do we I just try and I try to give over

00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:40,180
a picture where we stand on the AI for

00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:44,120
telecom for the for the network so we

00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:46,610
will look at the standardization

00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,340
organization so how they think of

00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:53,330
putting AI and the future networks

00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:56,090
together more of on the infrastructure

00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:58,580
level and a house AI the component

00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:04,480
should be connected we talk about AI for

00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:07,160
edge but I'm thinking us 5g and AI has

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,170
they mutually help each other because

00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:12,140
there is a challenger for the AI

00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:15,110
technologies it's really expensive for

00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:17,870
any AI technology and after you

00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:22,040
developed how you can really deliver a

00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:24,350
larger scale and you offer that in two

00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,780
different industry sectors you deliver

00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:29,930
the business value on top of the

00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:33,710
technology is a challenge and I think a

00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:37,040
5 G's here can help to spread out the

00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:41,600
technology really make it AI mo u P

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:46,010
critters available everywhere but sure

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:52,100
way so all the devices 5g is going to

00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:55,120
connect and will be empowered or enabled

00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:58,880
about several different levels of

00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:01,100
intelligence so now the question and so

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,520
it's a free to give questions to you

00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:06,350
versus I answer the questions so I want

00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,420
to talk about shooter AI so the our

00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:11,390
network itself who should be intelligent

00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:13,940
how should be how it should be

00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:18,650
intelligent and where we are now

00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:21,080
few questions for discussion so I

00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:23,180
mentioned a couple examples I can see in

00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,079
the literature not only in industry in

00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,350
the

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:30,170
in the AI conferences there are certain

00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:32,089
thoughts certain spots we apply AI

00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:35,199
technology for certain parts of the

00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:38,720
network my question is should I be

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:43,910
systematically available for 5g do you

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:46,069
have the infrastructure or do we

00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:49,910
seriously think what's the best way we

00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:51,910
collected data which kind of way we

00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:54,829
collected data is most the cost

00:15:51,910 --> 00:16:02,290
effective and really can reflect

00:15:54,829 --> 00:16:06,319
directly and cost-effectively and for

00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:08,480
some to sense the quality the status of

00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:12,470
the network or to sense the a user

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:17,269
experience so I'm thinking have me lots

00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:20,779
of thoughts and into the stand in the

00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:24,129
standardization on paperwork and in each

00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:31,389
company's I don't think we are there yet

00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:31,389
- you know how over always should do it

00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:39,709
second is what is but when we talk about

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:42,319
AI I just came back from a before

00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:45,410
there's a trip attend a is international

00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:47,959
conferences on speech recognition so I

00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:51,050
always think and we work on that working

00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:54,889
intelligence but what is what is our

00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:57,589
main math problem I think I mentioned

00:16:54,889 --> 00:17:02,449
this last time is on what level we need

00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:05,299
to do the abstraction so we can we can

00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:08,929
take the AI technologies which mainly

00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:10,880
developed for speech for image for

00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:16,520
natural language processing will apply

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:20,809
to our network for analytics and is that

00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:23,689
enough is our problem a unique enough to

00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:26,649
need any different set of technologies

00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:31,280
dissolve and what we can contribute back

00:17:26,649 --> 00:17:33,440
I don't think it's clear but I'm

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:37,190
thinking the AI technology is developing

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:40,100
is it's improving ante pace

00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:48,890
which I have never experienced in the

00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:52,580
past 20 years in there in a AI field so

00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:56,630
I just want to add a few words so for

00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:58,820
the for the for the mainly for the AI

00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:01,180
was the current state of our to AI

00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:04,310
technology pretty much designed for

00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:08,830
image processing for video for a speech

00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:12,590
for natural language but the network is

00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:15,170
different kind of a problem personally I

00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:20,060
think because we the AI technology is

00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:23,180
they're trying to trying to do what way

00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:24,890
human unconsciously to do because we

00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:26,840
recognize the face we don't know how to

00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:28,850
describe how we recognize face we

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,040
recognize the voice but we don't know

00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,840
how to do it and then you design a

00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,060
technologies you are trying to do by the

00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,850
way unconsciously how we unconsciously

00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:40,340
think but our tech our network is the

00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:45,710
way way is human designed is not a

00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:47,630
naturally formed the thing so but the

00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:52,520
network become a way and way more

00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:54,650
complicated and I'm thinking AI coming

00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,920
instead of a handle in the unconscious

00:18:54,650 --> 00:19:03,170
thinking here is it needs to handle the

00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:05,450
complexity so I talk about where the

00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:07,820
intelligence come from when we say we

00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:11,450
want our network to be intelligent to be

00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:14,750
ready for so we can so the network I can

00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:16,580
connect all the intelligent devices so

00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,350
the intelligence there's three different

00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,450
resources where the intelligence can

00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:23,000
come from you can learn your technology

00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:25,250
you can learn a model from data you can

00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,470
build up on top of your knowledge base

00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:32,780
you can you can have a environment where

00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:35,480
you can do trial to get to the feedback

00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:38,600
and then you can find you fine-tune your

00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:41,600
model but I think you for network we are

00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:44,510
lack for the three foundations I don't

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,420
think we're we're anywhere closer we

00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:49,190
don't have a huge corpus which can

00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:51,110
represent

00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:53,870
our typical problems in the

00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:56,270
largest-scale vailable open and we don't

00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:59,810
have that huge knowledge base we can all

00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:03,590
leverage our arm to manage to operate

00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:05,240
our network and in an intelligent way we

00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:08,030
don't have an environment we can do

00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,100
trial everything's pretty small if you

00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:12,950
look at the are the technical papers

00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:15,020
even the top conference for telecom and

00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:18,530
all the professor's are trying to have a

00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:21,310
very small network in their lab and then

00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:24,380
they do the experiments on which is far

00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:28,690
different from what we see in the real

00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:31,880
industry and what are they state of our

00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:34,040
technologies you know we often think AI

00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,410
something you give data you give the X

00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,210
and trying to generate to Y but Y a has

00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:41,330
been quite different from what was

00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:43,580
before we needed to really know

00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:45,740
understand to the technology then know

00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:50,030
how to put that into the network

00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:52,430
cooperation is our problem different

00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:54,410
from the typical problem as of today I

00:20:52,430 --> 00:21:00,160
already imagine couple ideas you can

00:20:54,410 --> 00:21:04,790
have more discussions so where we stand

00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:07,340
we you know I think in China Mobile made

00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:09,020
a decision we determined to work on

00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,210
solving this fundamental science

00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:14,290
problems and the engineering problems

00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:16,310
with the industry and with the

00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:18,950
researchers in the field

00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:21,410
we established a few laps with the top

00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:23,060
universities to collaborate we look

00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:29,810
forward to collaborating with the

00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:32,750
community - so any end I said - the name

00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:37,640
or the engine for platforms you can come

00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:40,100
from a poetry so it looks beautiful it's

00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:48,830
hard to translate so we'll leave it that

00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:52,240
way and last page and thank you all and

00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:56,660
we have a few booth touch little bit

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:59,540
what I talked about if you haven't come

00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,700
to the demo to the booth please do thank

00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:07,079
you

00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:07,079
