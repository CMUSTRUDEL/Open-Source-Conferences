	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,220
good morning everyone and and we're

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,980
happy to be here to share with you my

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,460
thoughts about the Fair G so my topic is

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:15,210
about building fair G deterministic

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,310
Network and empower the digital

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:21,000
transformation so maybe you were curious

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:23,820
about what is a fair G deterministic

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,250
network so before we talk that that's

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,130
how a brief review about the history of

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:32,880
a technology so the steam engine was

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:35,700
first invented in 1698 by Thomas away

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,700
due to the loss of efficiency it's only

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,360
being used for happines of water but

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:45,570
only after 70 years later when Ward's

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,300
enhanced this steam engine and it

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,730
provided the deterministic power then

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,250
the steam engine was widely used in

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,399
transportation textile and other

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,430
industry and human brains of first

00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:03,140
Industrial Revolution and the electric

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:08,100
generator was human in the best Siemens

00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:10,130
1866 but only after Tesla humanity

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,790
disease long-distance transmission

00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:18,570
technology the electricity was thought

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:22,250
as a deterministic source of energy the

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:24,869
internet was boring and 1969 from Abnett

00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:28,530
but only after company like Google

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:29,400
Amazon Ali Baba and the Tencent provided

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,280
this simple

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,049
deterministic online experience the

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,009
internet started changing people's life

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:40,229
so we can say upgrading invention can

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,869
change the society one only when some

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:46,560
determinacy was introduced so we all

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:48,659
believe Fuji will change the society so

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,460
it's natural to ask do we need introduce

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:55,439
some determination to Fiji so let's have

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,979
a look how determinants and go young in

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:04,530
telco industry the telegram in left

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:07,860
shows that when the network evolved from

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:10,590
evolution from 2g to 3G and 4G the

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,380
telecom losing the determinacy and in

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:16,080
the meantime the internet company

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,300
fill up the gap by you know meeting on

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,750
the application the based on the best

00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:24,660
day for the network of course this card

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:28,640
was a table and the user paid for those

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:30,600
value the diagram in red hand shows that

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,180
clearly is a well you're shifting

00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,960
accordingly so the revenue growth is

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:40,980
very slow for operators only about four

00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:43,020
percentage but revenue growth has come

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,960
to a four hundred percentage for the OTG

00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:50,310
in the past ten years so for the next 10

00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:53,630
years for 4G network construction if the

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:56,640
determinant curve we are not going up

00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:59,850
then the telco networker business we are

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:04,080
not to be sustainable so faculty must do

00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:06,980
something to increase the determinacy so

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,890
but what is the challenge we are facing

00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:12,870
so you can say the connection will be a

00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,270
problem the faculty will support more

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,700
and more left sensitive application like

00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:20,370
autonomous driving the telemedicine

00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:24,380
surgery the best effort Network er can

00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:27,300
not meet is also requirement under the

00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:30,330
technology capability of a telco also

00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:33,810
it's difficult to catch up the industry

00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:36,180
revolution evolution per every year more

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,790
than 100 the technology we are emerging

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,890
and how to embrace those latest the

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,580
software technology how to recruit the

00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:49,220
talent and return them and the TransAm

00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:52,170
will all be a problem and the in

00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:55,110
engagement with the ecosystem partners

00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:56,670
during manual mode so this efficiency

00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,830
can never fulfill the demands of

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,740
millions of enterprise demands for the

00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:05,270
fair G and also for collaboration in

00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:07,560
telco most osteo marketing and the

00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:09,930
bindus driven is paper-based

00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,360
collaboration compared to the engineer

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:16,500
level collaboration the efficiency is

00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:20,040
low and the interface is am guilty so we

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,530
can say to effectively run in Fiji we

00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,950
are facing structure challenges and

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:27,300
those problem are correlated so it needs

00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:31,340
a framework thinking

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:33,840
so here we provide provided this

00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:37,379
framework of our thinking to deal with

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,870
those challenges so you can see how a

00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:43,949
tool collaborative circle the unit

00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:47,370
circle is the internet resource how we

00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:49,530
zoom across the department to work in a

00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:52,830
unified platform and doing the confuse

00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:55,949
optimization the external circle is the

00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:58,379
house operators to build a platform to

00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:02,250
effectively integrated external resource

00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:06,060
like technology talent and partners as

00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:09,630
well as being this service to meet those

00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:13,789
industry application demands so the

00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:16,020
union ring and the external ring

00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:18,949
interactive and reinforcing and the

00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:21,479
recycling in each other so this

00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:24,949
framework specifically also provide the

00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:29,009
four kinds of a determinacy that says

00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:31,080
connection capability collaboration as

00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:31,909
well as computing I will talk than one

00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,580
by one

00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:39,150
so first the deterministic connection so

00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:43,349
for Fiji the food stack guarantee is

00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:48,180
needed so from bottom up in the did plan

00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:50,490
this M is enabling the connection price

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,849
computing capability such as the UPF

00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:56,009
should be deployed close to the user and

00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:58,590
application and demand to ensure the

00:05:56,009 --> 00:06:00,659
bandwidth and latency and as a

00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:03,960
high-performance heterogeneous computing

00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:06,900
capability should adapt into different

00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:09,539
application demands and the user control

00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,120
plans and weighs less in network where

00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:14,909
provide as a diversity as well as the

00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,340
security under the unit management plan

00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:19,800
the full autonomous driving experience

00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:22,710
rosa de mer autonomy and the cross to

00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:28,310
Marx tradition we award manual process

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:32,250
and certainty second for deterministic

00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:33,840
capability as we knows for so many years

00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,360
for Tara we have a great solution

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,490
strategy but how to current here we have

00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:42,470
the right technology and the right

00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:46,620
expert to realize it is more important

00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:50,550
so here we offer the technical portrait

00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:52,080
of a Fuji deterministic Network you can

00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,120
see there are many new technology for

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,669
each layer for example in the network

00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,280
layer the tears the heterogeneous

00:06:56,669 --> 00:07:01,970
computing and there's a cloud the

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:07,020
container with bare metal under the user

00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:11,539
management layer such as a model

00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:15,270
modeling the AI cloud native and the

00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:18,330
open API but the user application layer

00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:20,100
also many new technology like as a model

00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:22,830
driven the Big Data yeah

00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:25,919
and the security so if our network

00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:28,740
architecture is and the platform is

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,800
coming and open so by nature we have

00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:35,130
builder open capability and the tail in

00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,960
the circle with the industry so to sync

00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:39,419
up with the industry it's also helpful

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:44,970
for the Internet employee to grows and

00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:48,000
skill development the deterministic a

00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:51,180
collaboration IP do focus on the weather

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,830
creation for when the user is ok so

00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,590
through the collaboration with the open

00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:58,710
source and the standard organization the

00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:59,909
interface cross layer is more clear for

00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:03,120
example in the application and

00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:06,120
intelligent we use e-commerce in the

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,960
management and automation lis we use own

00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:14,510
app and the user Network an edge layer

00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:16,830
we use acronym so this open source

00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:19,740
cooperation framework will provide a

00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:21,510
code based clear defendant no ambiguity

00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:24,030
interface and boundary it will bring a

00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:25,979
great benefit to improve efficiency of a

00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:29,070
corporation and its build a good

00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:31,440
industry division for work and rebuild

00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:33,900
the mutual trust of an industry and

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:38,370
together we will enlarge the market and

00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:40,080
the build of healthy FFG industry last

00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,959
but not least is the deterministic

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,910
compute him we all think about you

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,700
should provide more than connections

00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:50,370
that's computing capability but how to

00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:53,160
attracting the industry to consume those

00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:55,050
capability we need a build allow and the

00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,900
prosperous ecosystem

00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:00,140
so provide this application friendly

00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:03,180
running arraignment user-friendly

00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:07,010
operating platform and the developer

00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:09,840
friendly torture or lab so how to

00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:13,920
leverage is the open source platform to

00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:19,620
achieve this is very important so as a

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:20,460
summary I I'd like to talk that two

00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,440
weeks ago

00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,480
so Thomas red monkey were interested in

00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,840
talking in CG GT that's the channel

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,650
going global think-tank the guy who

00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:34,740
think the world is flat and fast naka

00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:37,470
talked about the word is deep include of

00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:40,110
algae that means Falchi we are deeply

00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:41,010
involved in everywhere of the society

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,100
and the industry

00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:46,410
so can you back the determination is

00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,610
very important of of algae so based on

00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:52,230
the deterministic connection technology

00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:54,830
collaboration as well as computing the

00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:58,350
values of the provider differentiates

00:09:54,830 --> 00:10:02,010
value and experience to in the user so

00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:04,710
no matter for internal employment it

00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:06,510
employee or external partner the

00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:10,200
consumers as well as the enterprise

00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:13,290
customer so easy to go but we need to

00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,630
stay would be my best interpretation for

00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:21,450
Fiji thank you

00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:21,450
