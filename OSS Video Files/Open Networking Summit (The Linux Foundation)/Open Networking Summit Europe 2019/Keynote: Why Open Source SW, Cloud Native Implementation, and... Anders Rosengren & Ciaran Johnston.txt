great this is fantastic to be here good

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,649
to be on stage again you know when s I

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,410
think a fabulous conference both here in

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,090
Europe as well as in in US and now we

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,120
also extend it with edge for the next

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,470
year that's looking fantastic so yes as

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,670
you said RP that will talk about open

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,560
source cloud native edge and

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,010
orchestration and why that's essential

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:26,430
for 5g and I will start with the slide

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,680
that talks about 5g actually and I think

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,449
we all see now 5g being deployed it's

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,300
being deployed in u.s. it's being

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:36,840
deployed in Europe being deployed in

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,059
Asia and we see on this this slide here

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,940
at the bottom enhanced mobile broadband

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:44,219
as the first use case as the first set

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,469
of use cases that 5g brings and I think

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,289
you have all seen on YouTube the scales

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,539
of the happy 5g users where you go below

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:54,510
beyond one gig and the scales just take

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,059
there is an end to the scale I think

00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:00,930
that is of course what will be the first

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:04,049
thing that 5g brings to to the consumers

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,150
to the community to the industry but I

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,100
think we all understand that 5g is so

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,380
much more it's actually not just one

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,409
another G it's actually taking it into

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,840
being fundamental for the industry being

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,840
fundamental for the society even and we

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,549
see that in the use cases that we have

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,350
to the left and right that on the top we

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,640
have the massive machine type of

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:30,229
communication use cases which builds on

00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:33,689
sensors and will help digitize and

00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:35,400
revolutionize and disrupt a lot of

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:40,049
different industries like logistics

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:42,270
smart agriculture smart metering etc we

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:45,210
also see critical machine-type

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:48,619
communication coming in to the next

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:51,500
level of use cases which also will help

00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:54,450
digitalization and disruption and

00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,790
evolution and innovation in a lot of

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,009
different industries and this is why

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,930
the combination of the hands mobile

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,390
broadband to really bring you the speeds

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,969
and the feeds together with a massive

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,399
m2c together with the critical m2c those

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:11,459
use cases that's why 5g is so important

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,410
and such a different event compared to

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:14,910
previous G's

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,680
but I'm here not so much to talk about

00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,050
5g because it's not the 5g conference

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,180
I'm here to talk about what kind of

00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:26,280
technologies you need to really be able

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:27,650
to develop deliver and deploy 5g and I

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,210
will start talking about cloud native

00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:35,220
this is a slide that we also used in our

00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:38,730
tutorial earlier today talks about why

00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:42,540
Ericsson sees cloud native as a key part

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:44,070
in bringing 5g to live and when we say

00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,920
cloud native we means of course running

00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,990
in in containers we of course means be a

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,850
software being structured according to a

00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,220
micro services architecture paradigm and

00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:56,330
we of course means the possibility to

00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,410
scale these individual micro services

00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,900
independently lifecycle manage them

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:03,120
independently and we do that because we

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,760
need a speed we need a speed to have the

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,210
fast and low-cost introduction of new

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,730
services all these different use cases

00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:14,040
you cannot roll them out take 12 months

00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:16,500
you need to be much faster we of course

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,300
need the scale we need possibility to

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,870
scale from low-cost deployments and

00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:24,000
small deployments up to serving hundreds

00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,130
of cents hundreds millions of sensors

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,490
hundreds millions of consumers of

00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:31,470
industries efficient operations with all

00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:33,480
of these use cases and I will talk more

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:36,660
about the orchestration and management

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,030
part so that Lippett later here with all

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,710
these use cases it's not possible to

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,930
manually handle those you need the

00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:45,420
automation you need orchestration you

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,440
need to be able to lifecycle manage

00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:51,420
built on micro services technologies

00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,400
independently scale out scaling etc so

00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,920
that's why we also need cloud native to

00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,360
really succeed with 5g and we need the

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,600
performance and the capacity of course

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,430
we need to go all the way with

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,070
containers on bare metal to get the

00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,780
maximum capacity out of there out of the

00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,040
hardware we also need to be able to

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,230
scale the different parts of the

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,820
applications so that the user plane can

00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,250
scale out while we keep the control

00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,830
plane smaller for certain types of use

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,020
cases all of this needs cloud native and

00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:20,760
then of course we need to be quicker as

00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,710
a vendor we need to have the right

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,810
technology right software development

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,740
paradigm to really do software

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,770
development in a fast moving

00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:32,289
independent and with empowering teams so

00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,699
this is why we do cloud native and do we

00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:35,770
do cloud native for all of our

00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:37,960
applications going forward we're

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:42,009
starting with our five 5g dual mode

00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:44,020
cloud core it's being deployed and we go

00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:46,330
on and cover basically all of our

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,880
applications and workloads from Network

00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:52,000
functions to OSS to BSS going into cloud

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:55,150
native so I've talked about the

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,819
applications and I'm going to continue

00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:00,190
to talk more about the orchestration and

00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:03,669
the edge coming back to our lecture also

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:05,560
actually run demo here at the end so it

00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:07,240
will not just be me talking about it

00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,710
will really show what we do from an

00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,770
orchestration perspective to support

00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:15,400
cloud native and 5g but this is one

00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:18,070
example of what we also get with the

00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,820
cloud native paradigm we be able to

00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:24,389
delegate downwards functionality to the

00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:28,509
cloud platform to really be cloud native

00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:29,830
you need to delegate functionality for

00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:31,330
the lifecycle management of the

00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,090
infrastructure for the lifecycle

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:36,639
management of the workloads delegate

00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:39,580
that to kubernetes while you keep the

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,430
policy and the control in the VN FM and

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,080
the service Orchestrator so going cloud

00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,719
native is not just about the

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,479
applications is equally much about the

00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:51,130
platform as well as about the

00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:53,830
orchestration and management of those

00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:56,020
those different parts of the stack and

00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:58,360
without that you will not be able to do

00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:01,659
cloud native you're not able to do they

00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,759
the speeds the scale the efficient

00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:05,469
operations that cloud native promises if

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,690
you don't think about the complete stack

00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:16,419
and this is one example of what you can

00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:21,930
do with cloud native platforms so then

00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:25,380
coming to edge think 5g is all about

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:28,270
ultra-low latency ultra high reliability

00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,889
supporting these different use cases and

00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,360
that's not possible

00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,919
I think you add an excellent slide

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,110
earlier our Piatt about the edge and and

00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:37,000
that's we are replicating that here and

00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:39,400
saying that it's not possible to deliver

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,559
all of these use cases without a

00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:45,779
distributed

00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:48,749
cloud and edge is not just about putting

00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:50,789
a small form-factor hardware with an

00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:54,269
operating system and a cloud platform at

00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:56,909
a certain base station or central office

00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:59,099
it's actually much more about being able

00:06:56,909 --> 00:07:01,229
to distribute and orchestrate

00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:03,779
applications across that complete

00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:08,309
continuum from the central to the edge

00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:12,299
all the way into the enterprises as well

00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:15,599
as being able to orchestrate the total

00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:17,729
distributed infrastructure so handling

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,309
transport and connectivity physical

00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:21,719
infrastructures VMs and containers as

00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:24,739
well as that you from a service

00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:27,599
Orchestrator and network management or

00:07:24,739 --> 00:07:29,039
PMF manager perspective look at resource

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,609
orchestration and data center network

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,169
motivation etc so to enable to really

00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:35,669
deliver on the edge you need to think

00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:37,499
about the complete thing you need to

00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:41,729
think about how to distribute the edge

00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:43,319
and the different data centers how to

00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:45,569
distribute the workloads whether those

00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:48,149
are used to playing functions for the

00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:50,039
packet chorus as shown here to the to

00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:52,649
the left on the edge or whether it's

00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:54,959
third-party applications that are being

00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:56,759
deployed together with a user playing

00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,949
functions to really deliver on the use

00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:04,489
cases all of this you need to be able to

00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:09,299
handle then on on the edge to really be

00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:11,489
to succeed with the use cases then

00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:14,219
another thing that we also talked a lot

00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:16,529
about and that is super important from a

00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:20,299
cloud native perspective from a 5g

00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:22,709
perspective is well network slicing and

00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:24,809
it comes back again and talking about

00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:26,249
the same thing that cloud native is so

00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:29,219
much more than just a cloud native

00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:32,669
platform in order to be able to deliver

00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:34,409
on 5g in order to utilize and enable all

00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:36,000
the promises that both fiber brings and

00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:38,699
cloud native brings you need the

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,759
possibility to scale you need a

00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:43,199
possibility to distribute and you need

00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,050
to do that you can see here we have

00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:47,910
exemplified with three different slices

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:50,129
and it's important from an efficiency

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:52,949
perspective that you're able to as an

00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:54,360
operator deliver these use cases on top

00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,160
of the same

00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,709
telecom platform that you have

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,839
established so you cannot have different

00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:04,320
networks you need to be able to spin up

00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:06,800
and control lifecycle management SLA

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,300
wise etc all of these network slices

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,459
independently of each other quick and

00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,440
automated and therefore it's also

00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:15,029
important to see that you can see we see

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,240
the different examples here with the

00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:20,760
enterprise local connectivity those as a

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,589
laser probably about distributing the

00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,480
workloads the applications all the way

00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:27,660
maybe even into the enterprise close to

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,980
it while you keep some of the control

00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:34,550
nodes in it in the central office or

00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:37,350
aggregation site if you look at the

00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:39,980
public transportation slice slice here

00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:42,959
you will see that this is really

00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,670
optimizing for costs we bring basically

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,339
everything back to the central cloud

00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:49,560
just to run it as cost efficiently as

00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:51,930
possible because the bandwidth is low

00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,000
the request for low latency it's not

00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:56,070
there while for the mobile broadband

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,110
slice you go somewhere in the middle you

00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,600
place used to playing function centrally

00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:03,600
in the central office so halfway to

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,579
enable the high capacity while you spend

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,029
the the control plane centrally to

00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:11,519
maximize the cost efficiency and you

00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:14,339
need that orchestrate that from an cloud

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,470
perspective connectivity perspective as

00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:18,660
well as from an end-to-end service

00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:24,720
perspective across that's this complete

00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:26,940
distributed cloud so then I'm coming

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,399
into a slide which I think is maybe my

00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:32,100
favorite slide at this this juncture of

00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,959
the industry think we spent the last 12

00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,820
18 months talking about cloud native and

00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:37,820
cloud native applications we spend a lot

00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:41,310
of time talking about microservices

00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:43,199
containers but we also see that there is

00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:45,600
a little bit of a gap between the

00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:48,240
technology side of the industry and the

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,519
operations side of the industry and if

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,550
we will not succeed with cloud native

00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:58,040
and the promises of cloud native quick

00:10:53,550 --> 00:11:00,690
updates canary testing of a new delivery

00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,579
etc all of these things you will not

00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,620
succeed if you don't look at the

00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:06,569
complete technology stack so you need to

00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,950
start at the infrastructure need to

00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:10,140
deploy your cabinet the same for us

00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:11,580
structure cloud platform their need of

00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,410
course the cloud native applications

00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,330
because otherwise you will not see their

00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,070
but you also need to look at the

00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:19,980
orchestration and automation all the way

00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:22,560
down and make sure that you realize and

00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,540
control the container orchestration

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,600
environment because if you hide that you

00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:29,310
will not be able to get all the benefits

00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,900
but that's not enough you can just not

00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,670
just deploy the technology stacks you

00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,920
actually need to extend that as well

00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:36,330
into the operations and way work inside

00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,180
and there I think there is a little bit

00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:41,190
of a gap in industry today so we have

00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,550
exemplified it here with a continuous

00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:45,870
integration delivery and deployment

00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:47,310
chain that the Ericsson is putting

00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,380
together today that we are testing with

00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:52,920
some operators with a fantastic outcome

00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:54,930
actually we are shortening software

00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,900
delivery into operations network

00:11:54,930 --> 00:12:00,600
operation networks from weeks to days

00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,130
with this and we need to do more there

00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,020
we need to do more together with the

00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:06,270
industry as well but this is really an

00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:09,660
important part so really to take a look

00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:12,570
at this whole segment from the

00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:15,300
technology stack to the operation side

00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:18,180
and do that as a joint effort I think

00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:22,800
that is a cool fraction from me in this

00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:27,980
in this presentation and then coming

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:30,450
back final them to why we are here and

00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:32,310
why it's so important that we are here

00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:34,830
because I definitely agree our bit that

00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:37,020
open-source it's really an enabler for

00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:39,720
5g cloud native applications and

00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:41,850
infrastructure and Ericsson definitely

00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,680
realized that of course you also see

00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,970
standardization as an important part and

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,650
I think I could almost have done the

00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,660
speech that you say that standardization

00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:50,160
and open source both needs to happen

00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,590
because and both needs to be there

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,960
because otherwise we will not succeed

00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:56,910
together and you cannot do the you need

00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,010
both to really succeed in the networking

00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:01,440
industry but if you look at the open

00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:04,470
source situation then Ericsson is of

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,960
course a long-term member of LF

00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:09,470
networking engaged in LFX

00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:13,320
lavage cloud native computer foundation

00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:16,260
deep learning and we also add in our run

00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,110
and stepping into around to take a good

00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,850
lead there together with the industry

00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,790
working both in the specification as

00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:25,570
well as in the open

00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:28,510
our site and with that I leave my part

00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:30,460
and so I talked about orchestration and

00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:33,520
the need for that and I think we need to

00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:36,220
enable not just talk but show that

00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,860
Ericsson is doing way more so therefore

00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,720
I invite Kieran Johnston our chief

00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:44,020
architect for the OSS portfolio on stage

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,690
here please current come aboard and he

00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:49,810
will do a demo of network slides and

00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:53,680
automatic workload placement thank you

00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:54,880
very much thanks Anders hi Rudy so we've

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,430
seen a lot of information today about

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,020
the complexity and the flexibility and

00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,760
the dynamism of the networks that were

00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,090
building for an Oran going into the

00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,610
future

00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,770
and what this complexity brings is a

00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,840
need for more intelligent management

00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:11,050
capabilities so what I wanted to do is

00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:13,210
just to run through a quick demo of how

00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:16,060
we're working towards coming up with

00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:18,580
more enhanced heuristic algorithm based

00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,590
placement calculations in order to

00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,660
enable operators to manage their

00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:25,360
networks based more in the business need

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,590
rather than on managing the specifics of

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,050
the infrastructure into which they're

00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:30,520
deploying when an operator wants to

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,260
manage a service they want to look at

00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:35,380
things like the regulatory requirements

00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,880
the geolocation the cost of running that

00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,650
service what latency and throughput

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,010
they'll have in any existing node that

00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:43,330
might be in their network so in this

00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,470
demo I'm going to talk about the

00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,120
architecture on the left-hand side here

00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,950
you can see we have a service

00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,950
Orchestrator a resource Orchestrator a

00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:52,570
service design component and then an

00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:54,370
industry and topology component and what

00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:56,260
we've done is we've created a micro

00:14:54,370 --> 00:15:00,370
service based placement recommender

00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:02,320
using a heuristic ranking algorithm in

00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:04,990
order to make a very quick very fast

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,760
decisions in terms of where certain

00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:09,040
resources will be deployed in the

00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:12,970
network in order to optimize the the the

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:17,620
service quality so from that maybe we

00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:19,780
can run the demo ok so here you can see

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,180
we have a number of logical resources in

00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:23,590
our network and whenever you start to

00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,670
look at the geographical position you

00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,710
can see it's quite important to

00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,970
understand what we're placing and where

00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,560
we're placing it in order to get the

00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,510
best quality of service we have

00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,460
centralized data centers the NOC one in

00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:35,740
the middle some regional data centers

00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,940
and then some edge cloyd's

00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,440
first thing we're going to do is we're

00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,000
going to instantiate a service which has

00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,430
basic quality of service requirements

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,620
and it needs to put some stuff centrally

00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:47,020
and then push some stuff out towards the

00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,400
edge and here on the right hand side you

00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,680
can see that we have a llamo based

00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,090
descriptor which focuses mainly on those

00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,040
parameters the quality of service

00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:56,230
parameters in terms of bandwidth and

00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,660
latency that the operator wishes to get

00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:02,620
from this service when we go into

00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:04,360
instantiating the service we click on

00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:07,330
our service design deployment which will

00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,280
trigger the placement algorithm and when

00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:11,170
we do so down a second from the bottom

00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,670
you'll see we define an anchor point and

00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,560
the anchor point is important because

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:16,210
that's the point in the network and your

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,650
infrastructure where you want that

00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:21,190
quality of service to be made available

00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:24,160
to your to your customer and this is the

00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:26,320
only infrastructure related input that

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,960
the the operator will will need to

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,930
provide when you click on the execute

00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,950
button the service designer will then go

00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:35,350
off and figure out what are the

00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:37,710
resources that are best selected in

00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:40,060
order to make this in order to make this

00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:41,860
quality of service characteristics to be

00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,270
met and you can see where those

00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,620
resources then are going to be placed

00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:46,690
within the network and if we look at

00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,310
that from a geographical perspective you

00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:50,560
can see that we've run some stuff in the

00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:52,270
central data center in the in the middle

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,430
of the country and some other stuff out

00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:58,090
there on the East Coast close to the

00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:59,560
close to the end user so now we're going

00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,640
to go and talk about another couple of

00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,470
services that we're going to instantiate

00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,880
and here we need better quality of

00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,130
service so we're going to distribute

00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,750
some stuff down towards a regional site

00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,730
but we can also share these resources

00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,320
between multiple services in order to

00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,850
get the best utilization out of them and

00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,190
you can see here the layout of those

00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:18,490
services in in terms of the logical

00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:20,320
overlay and then we'll jump into the the

00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:23,470
map view in order to see how those

00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:25,600
services are being laid out in terms of

00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,760
the geographical location in order to

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,920
optimize the throughput and

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,360
characteristics requirements and lastly

00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,670
we'll join together the east and west

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,150
coasts and here again the algorithm will

00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:38,560
use two anchor points to define the the

00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,970
connectivity that's required between the

00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,820
two sites and it will join together

00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,260
those data centers on the on the on the

00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:48,830
west coast with the data center on the

00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:52,880
East Coast and I think

00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:54,740
that wraps it up so I'm seems like I'm

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,870
reiterating a point this we made several

00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,790
times already we've built all this

00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:00,860
largely on top of lots of open source

00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:02,690
software and with open collaboration

00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,850
amongst communities enabling us to

00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:06,080
provide these value add capabilities but

00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,520
of course we need industrialized

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,470
standards in order to bring these things

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,290
into production and make them run and

00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:14,330
your networks in an efficient and robust

00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:16,100
way this brings us to the platform for

00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,720
innovation that we need in order to

00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,000
enable what we're calling the next

00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,890
generation of advanced automation use

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,350
cases

00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:25,040
thank you very much like to thank you

00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:31,570
Karen

00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:35,270
fantastic hands up for so that concludes

00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:39,650
the keynotes the message is basically

00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:41,950
you need cloud native you need cloud

00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:45,290
native platforms applications

00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:48,140
orchestration and actually a holistic

00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:52,100
way and view across the technology stack

00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:53,810
and the operations to deliver 5g and to

00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:57,440
deliver cloud native characteristics and

00:18:53,810 --> 00:19:00,080
to enable 5g and we see open source and

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,320
standard session as important tools to

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:06,890
deliver a cloud native application

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:10,130
implementations so we welcome working

00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:11,430
together collaborating on this thank you

00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:16,819
very much

00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:16,819
