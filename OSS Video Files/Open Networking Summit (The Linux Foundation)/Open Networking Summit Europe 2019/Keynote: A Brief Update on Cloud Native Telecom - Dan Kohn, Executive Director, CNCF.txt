good morning my name is Dan Khan I'm the

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,350
executive director of the cloud native

00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,550
computing foundation and very happy to

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,519
be back again

00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,049
at the open networking summit I've been

00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:15,420
attending this now in both the US and

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:17,400
Europe for the last couple years and it

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,520
is really I find one of the most

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,380
productive events I like the sessions I

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,960
like the keynotes but just the hallway

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,420
track that I have here the people that I

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,699
run into from around the world who are

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,219
using kubernetes and other cloud native

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,809
technologies or eager to use them and

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,420
looking for a little bit of guidance on

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:39,329
it has been extremely productive for me

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,000
a CNC F is a part of the Linux

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:46,230
Foundation we are a sister organization

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,390
of LF networking and LF edge and ARP it

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,809
and I have had a really productive

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,039
collaboration over the last few years as

00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:56,039
these different worlds merged together

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,800
we're best known for our project

00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,940
kubernetes which is one of the largest

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,850
and fastest-growing

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:07,040
open-source projects ever we actually

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:09,869
now have six graduated projects and

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,510
sixteen incubating these are different

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,130
levels of maturity and and our

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,009
recommendations for the world but

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:20,640
kubernetes sort of has a gravitational

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,619
force around it that but in order to

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,970
have a complete solution a lot of these

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,850
other projects are really quite valuable

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:30,000
for things like connectivity and

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,820
observability and storage a lot of other

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,119
areas and then you can see here the 18

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:38,070
Platinum members that help back our

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,799
cloud native ecosystem we were very

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:44,610
pleased to add Apple as an end-user

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,140
Platinum member this summer so raise

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,619
your hand for me if you've seen this

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:53,880
cloud native landscape before yeah about

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:57,659
half so you can pick this up in the CNC

00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:02,969
F booth outside and the URL at the very

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:04,619
top LC n CF Deo lets you download it and

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:06,750
actually interact with an interactive

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,580
version of it this document has been

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,860
called helpful it's been called

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,480
overwhelming it's been described as the

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,269
hellscape

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,180
and there is this is legitimately an

00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:20,129
absurdly complicated and a detailed

00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,950
document I do feel like we get a lot of

00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:24,989
criticism for oh why are you making

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,659
things so complicated and it's sort of

00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:31,319
like oh this trail is really rocky I'm

00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:33,330
gonna go blame the map maker we're what

00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:35,910
we're doing here is legitimately trying

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,980
to map out all of the different options

00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,989
for the different aspects of the

00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,810
ecosystem but actually we like to have

00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:44,700
this document be the back side and the

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,530
front side we like to have the cloud

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,810
native trail map and again this is

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,030
available at LC NC f dot IO and you can

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,989
pick it up at our booth this is our

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,760
recommended path for enterprises to

00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:59,069
adopt a cloud native we're the very

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,230
first step is to containerize normally

00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:03,329
with docker containers the second step

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,760
is to implement continuous integration

00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:08,190
continuous delivery that you need to be

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,220
able to rebuild all of your software

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,859
from source constantly at any time and

00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:16,140
then only step three is orchestration

00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:17,430
with kubernetes and then you get into

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,739
the more complicated area so

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,660
observability and analysis using things

00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,970
like Prometheus for monitoring fluency

00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:26,940
for logging the new open telemetry

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:29,760
project project and jÃ¤ger for tracing

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,359
and and it keeps going from there so um

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,650
this is the path that a number of

00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:37,430
enterprises have adopted over time and

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:41,579
you can really see that in terms of

00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:44,250
kubernetes and the search trends you on

00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:47,220
Google Trends where this has just been a

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:50,489
spectacular level of engagement and

00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:53,790
adoption and interest over time when we

00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:56,040
started CCF less than four years ago it

00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,810
was really one of many orchestration

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,590
platforms and people were a little

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:03,299
unclear around how big container zation

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,010
how big cloud native was going to be I

00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:07,169
don't think there's a lot of confusion

00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,849
at this at this point another really

00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:11,879
great piece of evidence of this is that

00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:14,489
when we started less than four years ago

00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,650
we had three companies in our end user

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:18,630
community and we really appreciated

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:21,060
their support they're still with us was

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:23,880
ncsoft from Korea eBay and Goldman Sachs

00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,669
but wow we have a hundred and fifteen

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,950
now and so if you look at adidas and

00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:32,400
Amadeus here in Europe all the way up to

00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:35,430
the Londo and Zendesk and tons of pretty

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,950
exciting folks in between now we did

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,800
define the end user community as people

00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:43,500
who are making use of cloud native

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,599
technologies internally but are not

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,700
selling them to their customers so folks

00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:49,140
like Apple will sell you an iPhone but

00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,919
they're not selling you a hosted

00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:55,680
kubernetes service and so we do

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:58,110
explicitly exclude telcos from taking

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,090
part in our end user community and this

00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,580
was almost just kind of a definitional

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:05,070
issue which but which is why we were

00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:09,120
very excited earlier this year to launch

00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:11,400
our CNF testbed and the idea here is to

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,409
compare the performance and the

00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,909
capabilities of virtual network

00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:17,610
functions vnfs

00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:20,460
to what we call cloud native network

00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:23,520
functions or C NFS and so to do this we

00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,409
partnered with LF networking and we in

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:31,200
particular took some code some open

00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:35,039
source code out of onap the VB and G use

00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:38,550
case that's part of the VC PE and we

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:41,039
packaged it as a virtual machine and ran

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:45,750
it on OpenStack and then ran it on bare

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:48,120
metal servers from our a great member

00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,700
and supporter of CF the bare metal

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,010
hosting company packet then we took the

00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,710
identical networking code and we

00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:58,289
packaged it as a container ranted on

00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:00,419
kubernetes on the identical bare metal

00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:02,729
servers but one of the key thoughts here

00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:05,279
is that we didn't just do this once and

00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:07,500
then publish the results we actually

00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:10,770
created an entire open source project

00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:14,099
and have all this available on github

00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:16,710
today under an Apache 2.0 license that

00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:19,229
anyone is able to go replicate these

00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:21,440
results and what we've been able to show

00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:24,180
are some performance improvements and

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,250
some latency improvements in terms of

00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,950
the time it takes to spin up and how

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,440
many network functions you can run

00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:34,229
simultaneously on a whole variety of

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,149
different measures and then at the

00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:37,879
bottom I want to point out this URL

00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:43,069
github.com

00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:46,869
/ CN CF / Telecom - user - group this is

00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:49,580
our Telecom user group or tug that

00:06:46,869 --> 00:06:52,580
Sheryl hung our director of ecosystem

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,949
runs and this was our way to engage with

00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:58,159
the networking and telecoms communities

00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:59,360
where unlike the end user community we

00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:03,229
wanted to bring together both the

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,029
vendors and the telco operators and have

00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:06,740
them collaborate together and so this

00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:09,289
has just really gotten kicked off over

00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:11,779
the last couple months but I would love

00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:15,259
to encourage you to engage with us and

00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:17,839
participate it is open we have the first

00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:20,119
Monday of every month a call that's

00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,519
friendlier for the west coast of the US

00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:25,159
in Europe and the third Monday we have a

00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:30,139
time that's friendlier for Europe and

00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:32,899
Asia and we are working to extend the

00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:35,629
CNF testbed and try and make these use

00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:37,849
cases more practical so this is just a

00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:40,189
quick look and you can download these

00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:42,559
slides later from sched and take a look

00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:44,509
at it but it's showing this summer that

00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:48,349
we've been adding a number of use cases

00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:50,180
and functionality to the testbed I'll

00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:53,149
give a quick shout out to a sandbox

00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:56,029
project that's part of CMC F called the

00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:57,589
network service mesh that's been adding

00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:59,479
some additional functionality on top of

00:07:57,589 --> 00:08:01,999
kubernetes that's particularly valuable

00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:04,939
for these kinds of telco applications

00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:06,499
and here are our rough plans for the

00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:08,569
next four months where we have a lot of

00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:10,729
additional functionality that we're

00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:12,679
adding in but at the big picture if you

00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:15,409
look at really what we're aiming for

00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:17,990
with the CNF testbed over the next six

00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:20,419
months or so there's to get big pieces

00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,639
one is that we would like to evolve it

00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:25,099
to become actually a development

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,990
platform for cloud native network

00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:31,519
functions for C NFS so that as you're as

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:34,250
looking at taking your existing

00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:37,399
networking code porting your vnf to be a

00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,800
CNF that rather than just running it on

00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:42,769
your own environment both telcos and

00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,600
their vendors would be running it on the

00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:48,199
CNF testbed and what's great is that you

00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,180
can get an API key from packet and you

00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:50,510
can replicate our whole environment or

00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,580
your

00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:54,530
so welcome to run this on your own bare

00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:57,230
metal infrastructure that we would love

00:08:54,530 --> 00:09:00,770
to to support with you with it and then

00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:03,170
over time we are talking with the OPN

00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:05,150
EFI verification program ovp that's part

00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:07,700
of elephant networking to explore using

00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:09,260
the CNF testbed as a platform for

00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,230
certification where we do have an

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:14,990
aspiration here that CNF s-- can

00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:16,430
actually be even more interoperable than

00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,890
I think a lot of the goals were with

00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:20,750
vnfs that you should be able to have CNF

00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:23,870
from multiple different vendors running

00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:26,390
on platforms from other vendors so I'll

00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:29,120
finish by saying if you are interested

00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:31,100
in cloud native and adopting some of

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,050
these technologies looking at how they

00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,210
can be value to you this is a good

00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:37,340
conference please also consider coming

00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:40,880
to cube con cloud native con we're going

00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:43,070
to be in San Diego on November 18th and

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,380
we are gonna actually have the largest

00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,930
open source developer conference ever

00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,030
we're expecting more than 12,000 people

00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:52,820
to attend that we're then going to be

00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:55,790
back here in Europe and Amsterdam short

00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:59,540
train ride away on March 30th we'll be

00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:01,250
back in China in Shanghai July 28th for

00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:04,340
Cuba con cloud native con open source

00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:07,310
summit and then Boston and I'll just

00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:09,080
finish with a look at the when you talk

00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:12,050
about the level of engagement and

00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:16,220
excitement around cloud native four

00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:19,310
years ago we had just a about 500 people

00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:22,310
at the first cube con event in in San

00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:26,000
Francisco and that's grown to now be

00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:28,580
twenty three thousand developers from

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,700
across our three different events here

00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:34,280
in 2019 and at some point we're gonna

00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,960
hit peak cube con and and and go down

00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,840
but we don't think we're quite there yet

00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:40,790
and there's no sign yet that 2020 will

00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,130
be that point so I hope many of you and

00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:45,620
your colleagues will be able to attend

00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:48,350
our events either in US or Europe or

00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,420
China and please do feel free to grab me

00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:53,820
at the break and I would look talk about

00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:58,719
any of these areas thank you very much

00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,719
