	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,009
thank you our pet good morning everyone

00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:08,940
I was thinking why don't we play

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:10,530
jeopardy or the family feud I mean I

00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,570
tell you what how to set the bar for

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,920
moderator so then we have her wherever

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,719
you are out there give all of our

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,220
answers and questions that's right and

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:21,960
I'm a little bit too tight all right

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,930
well great well let's let's get into it

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,460
so yeah what is the edge so it's the

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,480
Wild West out there right you know from

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,340
my perspective

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,690
lots of whitewashing lots of terminology

00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,250
you know from my perspective lots of

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,719
folks kind of trying to do things on

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,940
their own you know and it's driving

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,379
fragmentation I know Jason we've spoken

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,730
about this and you definitely have some

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:43,770
opinion there let's start with you and

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,110
get your insight that's fine and so so

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,809
when we when we draw edge to cloud

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,660
architectures we always put the the it

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,579
in portrait mode because easier to fit

00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,960
in a PowerPoint and and literally the

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,280
edge is on the left all the time it's

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,170
the Wild West the west side and the east

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,710
side is like you know kind of the cloud

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,070
all that more civilized and and they're

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,330
longer the centralized data centers but

00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:08,520
so key point you know sink there's no

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,990
single edge you know and it this is part

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,130
of the confusion and we some foot it

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,310
depends on kind of who you are how you

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:17,100
define it the way I define edge

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,290
computing it's moving compute as close

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,080
is both necessary and feasible to

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,240
subscribers or you know devices if I'm a

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,820
telco I'm gonna move compute you know as

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,310
close as I need to to reduce latency you

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,409
know for subscribers reduce bandwidth

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,150
congestion on my own networks you know

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:34,650
so that could be my cloud edge yeah well

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,960
maybe I push push it into CPE equipment

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,100
on-premise because I have to do it so

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,240
there's that's the other thing is

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,560
there's they're kind of associated

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,570
locations but that is even that's an

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,270
organic boundary if I'm not man

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,820
operations person I'm necessarily gonna

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,439
move compute you know on pram you know

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,320
if I'm a nuclear plane I'm not gonna do

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,119
the cloud all right you know and stuff

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,240
like that so there's this spectrum of

00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:00,030
edges a lot of the fragmentation is due

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,850
to inherent complexities as you go from

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,610
cloud to device edge software and

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,590
hardware always gets more customized and

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,410
collects so you can kind of envision

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,709
this curve where like the the in the

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,160
cloud data centers IT new

00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:15,750
standardization has HAP

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,970
over the years it's relatively standard

00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,590
and it's not to say it's trivialized but

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,290
as you get further towards the device

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,820
edge the Wild West Hardware starts to

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,680
get more complex first you I need

00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,970
elevated temperatures support and I need

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,710
recognization then I need all kinds of

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,840
i/o then I need class 1 div 2 for

00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,190
explosion-proof than I need custom

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,330
hardware for every single thing on the

00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,530
planet like in terms of connected

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,410
products you know car is a little bit

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,630
different than a toaster and software

00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,160
goes a little bit like software goes

00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,720
flat a little bit longer you get it says

00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,800
everyone wants a different flavor of OS

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,390
and then you get into all the crazy

00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,160
protocols and then there's a point where

00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,530
you hit this trade-off

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,940
a memory constraint and this is what we

00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,280
call the thin compute edge where you can

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,730
no longer do virtualization or

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,370
containerization you want to extend you

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,320
know cloud native principles is close

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,820
from the cloud all the way down to that

00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,430
last point where you now have to go

00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,660
embedded because of memory and so we'll

00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,970
talk more about this as we go but

00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,320
there's these inherent trade-offs part

00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,600
of the reason why there's so much

00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,700
fragmentation historically in the edge

00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,860
is because the models for a long time

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,900
was I'm going to lock you in with my

00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,260
proprietary protocol yeah I would argue

00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,850
that IOT is more about Aliotti an edge

00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,680
is more about the maker movement than

00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,300
anything the maker of movement

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,990
Kickstarter IndieGoGo just Raspberry Pi

00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:33,570
Arduino whatever that that the ecosystem

00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:35,100
has driven people to change I can no

00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,440
longer lock you in because someone's

00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,820
going to out-innovate you faster so now

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,100
it's about how fast can you min evade

00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,780
and you win by merit not lock-in

00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,370
and so in IOT you've seen all these

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,720
platforms pop up everyone thinks that if

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,060
I can just lock you in and I can sell

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,590
your data if you let me reality is and

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,910
this is why we're all collaborating on

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,700
all of edge and you know broader

00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:57,000
communities is open always wins in the

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:59,220
end for scale always and if you want to

00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,720
really scale you need a multi cloud

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,310
strategy that starts with an open edge

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,510
sure and so this is this is all the

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,620
stuff that we're working on and I mean I

00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,510
there's so many different things we

00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,680
could talk about but yeah well you hit

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,300
the nail on the head right you know

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,920
proprietary and that's the power of open

00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,870
source is really right you know Melissa

00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,750
let's get your your insight there as

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:18,390
well well I think part of what has been

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,340
also really tremendous in this shift

00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,860
that's happening you know Jason kind of

00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,419
talked about what's the the movements

00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,040
that are moving up the stack I think

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:27,690
we've also seen

00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,910
the cloud technologies and the

00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,580
infrastructure software that's been well

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:35,750
established and is becoming you know

00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,710
more and more productized and

00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,910
implemented in common ways and I think

00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,680
Dan will probably talk a little bit

00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:43,110
about this in his keynote as well are

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,960
coming down the stack but then when you

00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:48,480
complement that with the diversity of

00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,370
workloads coming up the stack you know

00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,350
for all of these different use cases and

00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:57,360
then you introduce AI

00:04:52,350 --> 00:05:01,260
and FPGA and GPU the complexity of what

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,260
workload needs to go where physically

00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:07,770
where and how much can I put at that

00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:09,990
workload you know and then how do I load

00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:13,020
balance and make sure that I've got the

00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:15,960
right resources physical resources with

00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:19,500
regard to you know AI neural networks

00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:22,410
GPU etc where it becomes really really

00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,290
complex and I think that's one of the

00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:28,740
things that I hear from our partners a

00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:31,320
lot is helped me figure this out I get

00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,440
why opens gonna win right but holy heck

00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,840
it's really complicated it house open do

00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,820
that how does open source make it easier

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,220
to manage that complexity well I think

00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,590
part of what you see in the dialogue at

00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:47,160
sessions like this at OH&S and other

00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:49,980
open source gatherings is a conversation

00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:53,040
around what is the architecture and but

00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:55,920
by being open you get the best of the

00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,410
community's mind and you are able to

00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,660
leverage the best of the intelligence of

00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:02,970
where technology is headed and you're

00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:06,000
also able to leverage a pool of

00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:09,090
resources it's not just me doing my

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,700
development on my own kind of thing and

00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,200
so we can actually if we can agree I

00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,510
think it takes a little longer to get to

00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,120
common consensus on what that should be

00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:21,180
but once we get to a common consensus we

00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:24,180
can go much faster sure and then you

00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,800
also have the shared maintenance burden

00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,060
because everybody is not only

00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,710
contributing to the creation but

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,150
contributing to the maintenance of it as

00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,820
it moves forward excellent excellent

00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:34,710
Eric your thoughts yes falling onto what

00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:37,050
Melissa said I mean I think that the

00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:39,090
horizontal nature or breaking up the

00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,719
vertical integration so that you reduce

00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,939
friction

00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:43,349
and making it be easier to go deploy

00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:44,909
things I think that that's one of the

00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:46,949
things that we bring to the table right

00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:48,809
boy this is what's been done in the data

00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:51,029
center is what with the whole sort of

00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:54,149
how the open source stacks have evolved

00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:55,469
over time and the same thing is needs to

00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:56,699
happen on the edge and it's going to

00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:58,349
happen on the edge we're just trying to

00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,689
accelerate it but in terms of what is

00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:02,729
the edge well it seems like if you read

00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:04,559
you on the trade press it's anything

00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:06,959
that isn't in the cloud all right like

00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:09,929
okay that's not necessarily very useful

00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:12,149
definition and what what I'm trying to

00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:13,769
do is it's T support what are the edge

00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:15,539
unique requirement and they're different

00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:18,149
for different parts of the edge or

00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:20,639
different edges in the system so one

00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:23,249
thing that that to me is interesting is

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,619
this very sort of deep edge or you know

00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:27,239
enterprise edge in many cases it's

00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:29,309
things that are deployed so the Wannsee

00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:31,229
to seize a server sitting in the ceiling

00:07:29,309 --> 00:07:33,239
over there managing the AC or whatever

00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:36,059
right something that does some video

00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:40,169
analytics vibration analytics next to a

00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:41,819
a generator or something and and how do

00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:43,229
you actually manage that it's very

00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:45,449
different than what people have done

00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:47,339
with your laptop and even with your

00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:49,229
phone because the assumption is that you

00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:50,999
don't want to send a human being out

00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:52,259
there to update the software because

00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:55,229
it's too expensive

00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:57,029
and because this thing is it's you need

00:07:55,229 --> 00:08:01,619
a ladder to whatever a crane to get up

00:07:57,029 --> 00:08:03,449
there somewhere else it's you need to

00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:05,339
drive for a couple hours to get there so

00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,959
so what can actually do from a software

00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:08,429
perspective to go address those unique

00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,829
things whether it's about physical

00:08:08,429 --> 00:08:13,110
security about the the access to the

00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:14,819
things and as Jason said you know the

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,559
different IO requirements you have out

00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:20,039
at that edge are dealing with legacy

00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:21,839
serial ports and random radio

00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:23,729
technologies so that's a very diverse

00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,639
thing but but how can you make that

00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:28,259
stuff be more accessible so that it's

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,469
easier to deploy applications out there

00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:33,959
yeah and what's exciting about from my

00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:37,680
perspective the LS edge initiative is

00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:39,539
you know unifying these domains and you

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,750
know reducing that complexity in that

00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:45,269
fragmentation when you look at telco IOT

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,680
Enterprise and cloud you know and you

00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:48,660
know there may be some disagreement here

00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,389
on the panel but you know as an analyst

00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,399
when I sort of look at those domains I

00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:54,889
I think telco has one of the biggest

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:58,489
challenges when you look at latency

00:08:54,889 --> 00:09:00,379
location and mobility you know issues

00:08:58,489 --> 00:09:03,049
there so you know Eric let's start with

00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:06,049
you or are there any any best practices

00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:07,790
or learnings that the telco domain can

00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:09,860
take from those other those other

00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:11,689
domains well I mean I think that that

00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,730
sort of building on the sort of

00:09:11,689 --> 00:09:16,189
horizontal layers I mean one thing

00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:18,079
working up from the hardware is looking

00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:20,059
at what is actually common in terms of

00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:22,069
getting you know hardware root of trust

00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:25,009
being able to have some notions of

00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:26,959
measured boot in the space where you can

00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:29,209
actually you know take and boot

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,189
something typically Linux but maybe it's

00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:32,869
a real-time OS or something else that's

00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:36,139
gonna run out there and then build up

00:09:32,869 --> 00:09:37,610
from there by providing and you know

00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:39,499
common connectivity for your

00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:42,799
applications the applications cloud

00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:44,689
native applications for they assume that

00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,549
of what I get looks like an Ethernet

00:09:44,689 --> 00:09:47,899
well but you're running a rail tea right

00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:49,489
and because you're sitting out at the

00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:51,319
edge so does the application need to

00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:52,999
know about that well it shouldn't have

00:09:51,319 --> 00:09:55,480
to right you should be able to have

00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:57,919
struck that thing away so that notion of

00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,329
inserting a layer of virtualization is

00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:03,290
something that we're working on in

00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:04,970
project even as part of our fetch Jason

00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:06,230
your insights into the different

00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:08,059
projects that are also driving that

00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:11,179
momentum well start on the telco side I

00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:13,189
mean so just like many folks like many

00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:15,139
companies over the past couple years IOT

00:10:13,189 --> 00:10:16,339
edge whatever like everyone's trying to

00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:17,720
lock everybody in again because it's

00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:19,669
like if I can just lock you in then I

00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,619
can make money on your data if you let

00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:22,759
historically that's that's historic but

00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:26,149
what the reality is that's like trying

00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:27,949
to own the Internet what what anyone

00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:29,600
tell Kosar otherwise you know we look at

00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:31,339
is you must open it up and then there's

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,869
you use technology to bring checks back

00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,009
from strangers this is this is how it's

00:10:32,869 --> 00:10:35,480
also making the scales there's a lot of

00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,889
stuff that we're working on you know

00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,929
you'll hear about soon you know about

00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:41,449
that there's this notion of inserting

00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:43,100
trust at a system level so that you can

00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:44,779
cross cross between systems of systems

00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,369
so step one though it was like solve the

00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:48,619
insanity around everybody reinventing

00:10:46,369 --> 00:10:50,029
the middle yeah you know from with IOT

00:10:48,619 --> 00:10:50,899
specifically so one of the first

00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:52,819
projects

00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:54,619
well project that I'd hoped to get

00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:56,089
started with a great team at Dell and it

00:10:54,619 --> 00:10:58,459
became a Linux Foundation project with

00:10:56,089 --> 00:11:00,400
you know EDX foundry one of the anchor

00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:02,230
projects along with the crane out

00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,040
there's a bunch I was even and others

00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:07,960
coming in we'll talk about a Jax was hey

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,030
let's go extend cloud native principles

00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,740
you know down to the the thin compute

00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:13,690
edge so to speak Gateway's is you know

00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,910
one way to look at it let's do it in a

00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,260
way where you then open up an API in the

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,850
middle and if you get enough folks using

00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,310
something through collaboration and that

00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:23,050
becomes a de-facto standard and so if

00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,640
you have this open API that allows you

00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,870
to replace components whether it's

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,250
device connectors and I don't care what

00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:29,530
protocol you speak because you'll never

00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,480
have one protocol southbound especially

00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:34,180
there's there's thousands of protocols

00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,400
southbound in IOT why because of the

00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,510
lock-in plays everyone created protocol

00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,580
so that it was really hard to switch

00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:41,290
from my control system well now

00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,940
everyone's moving towards it's about

00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:44,350
software and services not about the

00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,790
lock-in you need to democratize the

00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:49,120
South so you can monetize the North

00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:51,010
right and so yeah edge X is all about

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,840
like hey no I don't care what hardware

00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:55,060
you use what OS use platform-independent

00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,310
you cloud native loosely coupled micro

00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,380
services you take your pick a protocol

00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,460
you plug it into the you know open API

00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,560
and then everything can be heterogeneous

00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,780
around it yeah and so that's what you

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,770
know Ajax was all about and is all about

00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,330
and so we're seeing a lot of you know

00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:10,390
pickup within that community and there's

00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:12,490
um so good stuff happened there give me

00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:14,020
that decoupling point the moment data is

00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:16,960
created and then I can send data

00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,850
wherever I want the the cloud strategy

00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,320
would normally be my multi cloud

00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,910
strategy of homes like I'm a big cloud

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,050
is like send me all of your data and

00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:26,380
then you can send it anywhere you'd like

00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:28,810
with you pay me a lot of money the edge

00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:31,450
X strategy is decouple your data the

00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:33,220
moment its created and then you pick any

00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,110
permutation from edge to cloud so all

00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,270
permutations work yeah and then you can

00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,710
kind of transport you stuff you know you

00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,820
left them right across the chain the

00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,650
other why not you know I've mentioned so

00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:44,020
we we've been talking about early this

00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:45,520
morning like the glossary project very

00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,740
important you mentioned the terminology

00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:53,800
there's a lot of buzzword bingo yeah

00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:55,570
like fog fog the fog is that's why we

00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,730
didn't really subscribe to that term but

00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,870
like your fog I can't see the fog is

00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,850
everything that's not in a cloud same

00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,040
thing I see all of the edges plus the

00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:04,750
network's in-between or whatever but I

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,090
when I was really important there's a

00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,530
project this edge of computing glossary

00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,750
it's like basically how do we get

00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:12,520
aligned on terminology that's industry

00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,380
and its semantics to some degree but

00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:17,500
yeah here's some exam

00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:19,570
so first off depends on who you are but

00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,220
Motoko in a world it's its near edge far

00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,660
edge but what's near and what's far

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,280
these are loaded terms that's like a

00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:28,570
ever seen Sesame Street Oscar the Grouch

00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:30,670
or far what do you mean it's better to

00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:33,310
talk in absolutes people say real time

00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:35,140
way too much real time to a building

00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:37,330
automation person is 15 minutes

00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,830
real time to an air bag is like a

00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:41,650
fraction of a second and it must be

00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:43,690
deterministic real time to a financial

00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:45,400
person is milliseconds but no one dies

00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,110
if you don't get 5g you are old

00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,300
it's less than five millisecond latency

00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:51,010
so we need to talk about absolute you

00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,570
know tiny I hear all the time data

00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:54,280
center people say tiny it's tiny it's

00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:56,290
500 megabytes of footprint you know the

00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,570
world that air that Eric lives in it's

00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:00,520
five kilobytes you know some some cases

00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:02,980
so we have to get aligned on absolutes

00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,990
that are descriptive around inherent

00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,450
trade-offs and that's where I think

00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,680
there's some general terminology and

00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,930
then there's like let's not use loaded

00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,150
terms let's use absolutes yeah and it

00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:14,890
matters because I think like every

00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,840
conversation I am in we spend the first

00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:18,460
15 minutes of the conversation just

00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:23,110
getting grounded on what we're talking

00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:25,450
about like get over this right right I

00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:28,030
think another thing that's another

00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:30,370
lesson learned that is an area where LF

00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:32,950
edge is investing and it's really

00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:35,290
important is you know if we think back

00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:39,700
to what happened with the cloud

00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:42,130
transformation and you know telcos and

00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:46,000
cloud operators and tier twos you know

00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:48,490
they all implemented common open many of

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,290
them implemented common open source

00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:52,420
projects for their cloud infrastructure

00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,760
but because they were standing them up

00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:57,430
as things were being developed each one

00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:00,790
of them did it slightly differently you

00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:03,490
know OpenStack running cassetti's you

00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:06,970
know kubernetes running OpenStack all VM

00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:09,190
container you know and so now all of

00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:11,860
those different companies are spending

00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:14,440
enormous resources maintaining what

00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:16,330
isn't essentially is open source that

00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,950
became proprietary because of the way

00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:21,820
that they integrated it was unique to

00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:24,160
their particular business and so taking

00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:27,150
the lesson learned from that and really

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,210
being focused on hey if the vision of

00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:35,339
is to be realized while I'm still

00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:37,410
working we need to stop kind of the

00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:39,420
fractured nature well by which these

00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:41,760
open-source projects get consumed right

00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:44,850
and we need to work as a community not

00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,230
only in their building of these

00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:48,930
components but in the way they get

00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:51,210
integrated to realize actual use cases

00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:53,160
and so there's a project as part of LF

00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:54,779
edge called a crane oh where that's

00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,310
exactly what the project is about it's

00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:58,500
the community coming together with

00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:01,260
specific use cases in mind and saying

00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,029
okay for this specific use case I would

00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,220
like to architect this with these

00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:08,460
components these assets and integrate it

00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:10,350
in a completely declarative fashion this

00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,120
hardware this software this release of

00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,740
this software etc this is how you

00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,990
integrate it this is how you render it

00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,510
this is how we validated it a lot of the

00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:20,580
open-source projects don't actually

00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:23,130
validate the functionality that they

00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:25,440
attest to they'll have a feature and

00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:27,420
they release it but how is it validated

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,120
and what kind of test cases with what

00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:32,670
kind of you know bandwidth constraints

00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,310
etc and so a crane know is really trying

00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:36,900
to say hey let's simplify this let's

00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:39,089
nobody's going to differentiate on

00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:41,220
infrastructure software right it's all

00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:43,140
going to be on the App Services business

00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,810
models running on top how do we

00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:48,209
accelerate the infrastructure to make

00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:50,850
this possible and do so in a way that

00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:52,589
the whole community benefits for now and

00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:54,330
for the long term and I think that's

00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:56,880
really really compelling it is a

00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:59,070
different type of open source project in

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,450
the sense that you know it's not as much

00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:02,700
of a development project there are some

00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:04,890
development aspects but it's it's really

00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,870
folks coming together to do the dirty

00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,290
work of making this stuff product

00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:09,720
izybelle

00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:12,270
sure and I think that that's really a

00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,309
tremendous effort no I'm not an engineer

00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,929
but I like to play one on TV shouldn't

00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:17,850
that be the model for all open source

00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:20,610
projects to drive adoption and drive

00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:23,610
scale I think it should be and I think

00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:25,829
we're kind of at the cusp of seeing some

00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:28,199
of this I think you know openstax done

00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:30,210
some of this the cloud native compute

00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:31,710
foundations doing some of this but what

00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,480
I think is differentiated about a Cray

00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:36,780
know is it's actually pulling from all

00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:40,520
the upstream projects to render these

00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:42,370
use cases as complete vertical stacks

00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:45,350
and reference tax for the community and

00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:48,260
and so I think we're in a pioneering

00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:49,670
kind of step forward when the context of

00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:53,230
open source and we'll see if it works

00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:55,160
yeah there are definitely skeptics

00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:57,380
awesome awesome well we've got some time

00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:00,230
left so I want to I want to throw a

00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:02,240
bonus question to the team here our pit

00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:04,550
stood up and dropped the mic when we

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,050
when when ONS got kicked off and talked

00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:10,550
about how the impact of the edge

00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:12,890
potentially could be a for acts that of

00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:15,920
what we've seen with cloud clouds been

00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:17,630
pretty pretty accepted you know so for

00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,420
me that's that was pretty mind-blowing

00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:22,880
so I'd love to get each of your you know

00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:24,470
your insight on how you see that

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,970
happening I mean are there are there

00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:28,100
certain lunch pens that'll that'll

00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:29,720
that'll occur that'll that'll really

00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:34,400
drive that so Melissa have you start

00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:37,520
with you so I apologize I wasn't

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,220
listening to your question thinking

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,020
about the fact that I failed to mention

00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,910
a couple things when I was talking about

00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,250
got totally passionate about a crane oh

00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,540
yeah and I failed to mention the fact

00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,370
that there are a couple other projects

00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,840
as part of elephant yeah including the

00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:58,100
ones that are pet mentioned yesterday

00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:59,540
when you said that I was like Oh anyway

00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,040
so there are some new projects that were

00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,410
part of elephants that were announced

00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,720
beta land fledge were also there are

00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,860
seven projects total as part of

00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,130
elephants you've heard a couple

00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:11,810
mentioned here there's also a laundry

00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:14,690
list of new projects that are being

00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:16,550
contributed to LF edge so there's a lot

00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:18,740
of opportunity to fur folks to get

00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:20,750
engaged and I think the reason that

00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:23,450
there's so much interest from the

00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:26,060
ecosystem and from the participants in

00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:29,390
LF edge and these different new projects

00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:31,370
is the diversity of use cases so while

00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,780
there is infrastructure software that

00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,760
are common components that can be

00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:36,680
leveraged some of the challenges that

00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:41,270
exist in the context of edge

00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:42,710
technologies are are unique and they're

00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:44,840
different and they require different

00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,330
software and different capabilities and

00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,860
components and so I'd encourage you to

00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:50,180
get you know to check out some of the

00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,010
new projects that were announced there's

00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:54,529
a ton of documentation on

00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:56,990
elephant website the wiki elephant org

00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:58,610
so you can it's very easy to get

00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:01,580
informed and true open source fashion

00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:03,200
everything's open so please leverage

00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,789
what's available to get more informed

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,100
about these different projects thanks

00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:09,049
and then the key of course is within ofs

00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,130
all linux foundation projects is the

00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:12,320
governance I mean that vendor-neutral

00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,639
governance the whole point of an

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,380
umbrella project is probably many people

00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:16,429
know you know cloud native compute lift

00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,960
networking there's there's a bunch of

00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:20,120
different the models been proven time

00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,830
and time again it's yeah bring it be

00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,330
inclusive bring projects in even if

00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,710
there's some overlap up front but then

00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:26,389
let the community you know working with

00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:28,010
that structure governance the technical

00:20:26,389 --> 00:20:30,500
advisory committee and all that shall

00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:32,059
help to kind of harmonize these projects

00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,909
over time that's yep a key part of that

00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:36,080
mission is that nobody wins is you most

00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:38,120
of said so well like you're kind of

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,039
reinventing you know that the middle is

00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,510
someone told me once like open source is

00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:45,889
all about minimizing undifferentiated

00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:46,669
heavy lifting this is important about

00:20:45,889 --> 00:20:48,830
that one for a while

00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:51,049
yeah but answer question on the cloud so

00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,250
there's a lot of stuff I mean I all data

00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,630
is create at the edge and there's no

00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,340
doubt that just there's just more and

00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:58,250
more devices you know popping up and on

00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:00,380
networks and this is going to cause you

00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,880
know a lot of congestion and a lot of

00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,980
need to kind of shift compute you know

00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,389
as the cloud going away no no there's a

00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:08,179
lot of clickbait over the cloud is gonna

00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:10,519
disappear no right will the cloud always

00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:12,710
do the deepest of deep learning yeah are

00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,539
you gonna see more learning happening at

00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:17,630
the at the edges yeah I call that

00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:20,510
shallow learning you know closer to the

00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:22,460
edges yes you're gonna see that the

00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:24,440
point is is is that we don't know where

00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,700
things are gonna run you in the end we

00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,679
haven't even scratched the surface yet

00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,260
on on the business models in the use

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,120
cases and get out of just like you POC

00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,320
party of one now try to scale you know

00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,610
that solution now try to do that

00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,710
solution that intersects with other

00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:38,480
domains that's the real potential this

00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:39,769
is why you need open you can't public in

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,779
private and you know all these different

00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:43,070
folks without trust at a system-wide

00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:45,409
level so that's what you know the big

00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:47,779
next conversation the point is if you

00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:49,399
architect properly even if you're right

00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:50,960
answer day one is to send all your data

00:21:49,399 --> 00:21:53,240
to some cloud and then do stuff

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,649
centralized yeah right but you're not

00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,090
gonna want to stay there cuz you've got

00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:58,159
the bill it's gonna be a hybrid you know

00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:00,409
you're gonna want a hybrid model and so

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,000
over time you need to be able to have

00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:03,620
that you know transport ability of

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,570
workloads anywhere along that continuum

00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,180
right

00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:09,070
and that that means that you right now

00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:10,630
have to architect properly and this is

00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,160
why you know things like in Crane Oh and

00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,480
stuff with with even we're doing I mean

00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,880
the home edge is another project within

00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,740
LF edge of you know what's even in the

00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,690
home you're gonna start seeing folks you

00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,100
know your your gateway looks more like a

00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:24,220
server hosting all the different

00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:26,380
services you know and and all of these

00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:28,600
trends all these abstract and everything

00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:31,210
you can abstract you compute storage

00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,920
networking always separate the data from

00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:34,570
the underlying infrastructure in the end

00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,940
it's about consistent infrastructure

00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:38,500
with domain knowledge applied the

00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,970
winners will have the best algorithm

00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,610
have the best specialty Hardware

00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:44,890
specialty software no one wins

00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:47,320
reinventing the middle right so the

00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:49,030
short answer is like you're gonna see a

00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,110
massive you know change you know across

00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,280
the board the last thing I was saying

00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:54,160
when I you know give time to air because

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,630
I get asked all the time isn't five g's

00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,120
just gonna make edge computing you know

00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:01,090
a short term live right yeah yeah the

00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,620
latency you know you know you know very

00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,210
low but number one I don't care how many

00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,470
nines you have on reliability I'm not

00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:09,550
gonna let you to deploy my airbag from

00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:11,110
the cloud and number two bandwidth

00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:13,690
always comes with a cost

00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:16,030
right the analogy I use is if if you

00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:17,320
build freeways people think oh oh solve

00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,790
the traffic problem by building freeways

00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,170
well what happens more people move to

00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:22,570
town suburbs and then you have more

00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:23,680
traffic yeah everything raises up so you

00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:25,150
get new experiences it's gonna be

00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,380
incredible like all this cool stuff but

00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,090
it's not gonna solve the bandwidth

00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,920
problem right an economics drive it as

00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:31,450
well you know license versus unlicensed

00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,950
spectrum we go all day Eric why don't

00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,960
you close us out you know any additional

00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:37,780
thoughts here yes I mean if you look at

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,640
where the edges are I mean yes all the

00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,750
people that are analyzing this stuff is

00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,820
saying that the amount of data that's

00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,710
generated they're just growing and it's

00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:46,120
gonna grow and it's gonna take over the

00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:47,830
amount of data that actually makes it to

00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,600
the cloud just in terms of amount of

00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:51,280
data if you look at actually deployed

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,810
infrastructure you can even argue that

00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,300
the edges already here and already

00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:57,790
bigger than the cloud it's just not

00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:00,160
connected yet right if you walk into a

00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:01,750
factory floor you will find industrial

00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,820
pcs sitting in every machine on the

00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:05,800
floor right they might be running some

00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:08,020
app running Windows or whatever and

00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:11,380
hopefully old version of it but

00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:13,630
hopefully not it's probably hasn't been

00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:15,610
passed in a while right install the

00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:17,210
machine windows but people want to get

00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:19,250
that data out right

00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:20,570
and and and and how can they get the

00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,550
data out well maybe they deploy a

00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:24,140
separate you know Industrial PC next to

00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:27,140
that you know run something more modern

00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:30,530
software wise you know not Windows 98 or

00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:32,150
whatever and and then build it up but

00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:35,000
but I think the opportunity is there and

00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:37,550
and the being able to gather that data

00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,440
do a bunch of the computing locally and

00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:40,970
then saying okay what do I need to

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,310
export from here to the cloud had a

00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:45,770
bullet system and making that easy to

00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:47,960
leverage from from the perspective of

00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:49,400
people developing applications as well

00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,200
as the people that want to deploy the

00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,610
network services that I can actually

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,410
connect that stuff together so I think

00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:56,420
that that's a key thing excellent well

00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,280
Eric Jason Melissa thank you so much

00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:01,510
great insights enjoy the rest of the

00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:06,960
event thank you

00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:06,960
