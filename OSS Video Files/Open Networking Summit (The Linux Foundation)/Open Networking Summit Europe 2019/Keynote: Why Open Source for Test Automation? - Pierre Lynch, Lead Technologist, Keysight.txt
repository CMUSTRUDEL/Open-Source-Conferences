thanks Harpeth and welcome everybody

00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,720
good morning keysight technologies is a

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,690
leading technology company that helps

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,719
enterprise service providers and

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,299
governments accelerate innovation in

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,190
order to secure secure and connect the

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:19,350
world but i'm not here to talk about

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,869
that i'm here to talk about something

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,210
way way more fun and totally different

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:26,849
and that's the birth of a brand new open

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,609
source community called open tap where

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:31,800
tap stands for test automation platform

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,500
and we think that's entirely relevant

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,360
and i think everybody will agree

00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,710
automation is a big deal these days so

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,180
i'm gonna step back a little bit and

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,430
give you a little history of where it

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:45,420
comes from and i'll start with this

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:47,489
quote or what's his name martin martin

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,309
Miko's says that there are always people

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:53,489
who will spend any amount of time in

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,230
order to save money and then on the

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:57,870
other side there's a lot of people who

00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,180
spend a lot of money in order to save

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,800
time and at one point during your life

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,359
or the life of the company you'll switch

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,409
from one to the other depending on

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,270
priorities and value that you see now

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:13,020
I'm gonna be your worst nightmare order

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:15,780
I keep moving around the so that goes to

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,790
how we started it so tapped test

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,670
automation platform it started as an

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,890
internal project to help us with our own

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,320
internal testing so they started

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,110
building this project but then when they

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,180
found out other people through all the

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,220
other teams wanted to do the exact same

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,930
thing they basically opened it up

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,290
internally within the company and that's

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,150
a large company now and what they notice

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,040
is a lot of people started using it and

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,590
also started contributing to it so it

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,560
started growing in terms of users and in

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:49,409
terms of capabilities etc because they'd

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,380
opened it up internally so what's what

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:54,479
we call inner source so and and it

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,979
really worked like it all of a sudden it

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,479
could support all sorts of instruments

00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,280
within keysight and it started growing

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,439
and growing over the space of five years

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,420
and then they figure hmm wait what can

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,790
we learn about this you know how can we

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,280
move forward with this so we started

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:11,970
talking to our partners our people for

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,470
externally who used tap and then got

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,690
encouraged by them and

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,770
eventually partnered with them to

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:21,900
convert tap into open tap a decision was

00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,730
made a few years ago and everybody at

00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,010
Linux Foundation I'm sure knows that it

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:30,480
takes a while to prepare things for an

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:33,660
open source community so last May we

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,090
announced it we made as big of a splash

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,340
as we could we wanted to make everybody

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,740
aware of its existence so that people

00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,140
might get interested in it and and see

00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:45,360
if we can get people you know into the

00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,830
community okay so we talked to the press

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,990
and we're still doing that that's why

00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,930
we're here right now we want to increase

00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:55,020
awareness of this project as much as we

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:57,300
can so in July on top of that we started

00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,250
talking to people directly that would be

00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,610
interested in this either test and

00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:05,459
measurement companies or integrators or

00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:07,590
like toca labs a test as a service

00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,390
company that they do this kind of stuff

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,970
and they got immediately interested so

00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,380
we've already interested some companies

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,890
to come and participate and contribute

00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:19,500
into this community along with the

00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,720
company that found that it was ourselves

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:26,370
nokia it because they were using it as

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:29,370
well so just to give you a very brief

00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:31,190
high-level overview is open tap is an

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:35,130
engine in the middle of a very modular

00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:37,140
architecture where the the driving force

00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,090
are the instrument plugins and I like

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,890
that because keysight is full of

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,350
instruments that were being automated

00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,840
but that's evolved considerably where

00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:47,700
it's not only instrumentation that can

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,400
be automated it's other software

00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,290
components or other software frameworks

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,019
to the point where we already have a

00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,750
plug-in that includes

00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:00,390
OPN AV yardstick into the fold and then

00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:03,180
there's device under test plug-ins all

00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:06,630
these are all modular and fit into the

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,519
engine like that user interface result

00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,739
listeners or logging you know how to

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,600
store the results and obviously the

00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,140
mechanism to go through test steps and

00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:18,690
automate the test process completely now

00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:21,299
what I found find very cool about this

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,760
is that this is not vaporware it just

00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:26,300
launched in May

00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:28,280
but it already is running and it's

00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,400
deployed in the WHA wild and the best

00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:35,440
example is a 5g Vinny project Vinny

00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:40,010
stands for vertical innovation

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:44,030
infrastructure it's a 30 20 million euro

00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:48,290
three-year project through horizon 2020

00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:50,810
and also the 3gpp projects that has a

00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:54,200
goal of establishing infrastructure

00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:56,960
complete with radio for 5g and allowing

00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,970
verticals to come see and and prove to

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,060
them that it works and also to

00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:03,620
experiment with it to see how it works

00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,390
where their vertical itself and there's

00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,920
a it's a conglomerate there's 23

00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:10,790
companies you'll recognize some of the

00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:13,250
big names in there and right now there's

00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,930
of all the installations they have

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,580
there's five of them where the test

00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:18,890
automation is completely done by

00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,620
open-top so I get a kick out of that it

00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:24,080
was launched in in May and it's already

00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:28,340
deployed and active and proven and it

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:32,420
will evolve ok so obviously open tap has

00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:35,690
a home we built a website open patio you

00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:38,240
visit and the code is available on

00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:40,100
github so we're inviting everybody to

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,740
come take a look at it see what you

00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:46,010
think what value you see and then maybe

00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,600
contribute to it and use it once you get

00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:50,240
there you'll find a ton of resources

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:54,040
such as an introduction video a

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:57,560
developer guide very importantly a

00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:59,390
project overview blog etc all sorts of

00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,310
things to get you kick-started this was

00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:04,430
all in the preparation phase to begin

00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:06,260
with and there's a monitored email

00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:09,110
address where you can ask questions and

00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:12,170
you will get answers so I'll leave you

00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:15,710
with the last quote that basically says

00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:18,680
change its inevitable from Elon Musk I'm

00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:20,510
obviously paraphrasing and I think this

00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,480
is part of it I think we all recognize

00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:24,020
that that's it thanks for hanging out

00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,780
with me

00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:29,250
have a great day

00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,250
