Description: 
	Keynote: Scaling DevOps – Moving from Mechanization to Automation - Amy Wheelus, Vice President, Network Cloud, AT&T

As operators embrace and scale DevOps, it takes more than just moving groups of people together into scrum teams and common organizations. It means changing the paradigm of how we operate our networks. It requires shifting from humans validating what mechanized processes deliver to linking mechanized processes together with outcomes initiating the next process step. These concepts may be easy for leadership to get behind, but implementing them requires discipline. AT&T will share from their experience on this journey and outline areas of focus in the open source community that can help accelerate us on this journey.
