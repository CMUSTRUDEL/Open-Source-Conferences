Title: Keynote: Scaling DevOps – Moving from Mechanization to Automation - Amy Wheelus, AT&T
Publication date: 2019-09-24
Playlist: Open Networking Summit Europe 2019
Description: 
	Keynote: Scaling DevOps – Moving from Mechanization to Automation - Amy Wheelus, Vice President, Network Cloud, AT&T

As operators embrace and scale DevOps, it takes more than just moving groups of people together into scrum teams and common organizations. It means changing the paradigm of how we operate our networks. It requires shifting from humans validating what mechanized processes deliver to linking mechanized processes together with outcomes initiating the next process step. These concepts may be easy for leadership to get behind, but implementing them requires discipline. AT&T will share from their experience on this journey and outline areas of focus in the open source community that can help accelerate us on this journey.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,859
good morning okay yeah I got to do

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,230
better than that if I have to be up here

00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:10,019
on stage y'all have to be awakened alive

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,120
I know that there was a lot of like

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,000
nightlife going on down the street away

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,590
from the the train station last night

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,449
because I walked by and it was really

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,020
seemed like fun environment

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:24,900
we'll try it one more time good morning

00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:26,279
much better much better it's great to be

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,130
here with so many friends and colleagues

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:31,710
from around the globe this morning I'm

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,510
gonna continue some of the conversation

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,210
that our pets started yesterday about

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:39,390
you know what's next what do we do next

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:42,870
how do we move forward and I'm going to

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:45,780
start by talking a little bit about AT&T

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,940
network transformation and where we are

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,250
on that journey where we are on our

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,920
maturity curve you know it all started

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,420
about almost five years ago now it seems

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,190
like forever ago but then five years

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,809
seems very short time when you talk

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,120
about the major shifts and

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:03,870
transformations we've done as an

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,840
industry and for us we started with

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:11,490
virtualization John Donovan challenged

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:15,000
us to virtualizing control 75% of our

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:18,869
target network by 2020 and I'm happy to

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,770
say we are on track to do that along the

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:24,540
way you know software control is the

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,189
next step of that you virtualized it and

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,590
then you sulfur control those virtual

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,900
functions a colleague of mine Mike

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,110
paradise wrote in a blog a couple of

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,329
weeks ago and compared the

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:39,210
virtualization of our network to

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:41,460
building highways and when you build

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,740
highways then you open them up and you

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,299
put traffic on those highways and that's

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,460
what we're doing today and our Software

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:51,689
Defined Networking we're putting traffic

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:54,090
on our network and we have currently

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:56,939
about 75% of the traffic that goes

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,860
across our MPLS tunnels the data traffic

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:02,329
moving across those MPLS tunnels about

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:05,219
75% of that is software controlled and

00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:09,179
we use software to do things like

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:11,310
automatic rerouting caring for outages

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,170
caring for events such as hurricanes

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,940
which we've

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,210
experienced recently over in the United

00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:21,300
States and you know those are things

00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,320
that were extremely proud of but we

00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,690
didn't stop there

00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,570
you know white boxes was the next step

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:30,870
on the journey and we have white boxes

00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:33,720
deployed in our network in production in

00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:37,050
many places one of which is our network

00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,570
cloud we connect the servers to each

00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,550
other through white boxes and that

00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,320
Network cloud is where our 5g packet

00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,930
core rides it's in production live

00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,690
carrying traffic today we also have

00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:51,150
flight boxes at our cell sites serving

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,780
as a saiad type of function we also have

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:57,739
white boxes at our customer prims

00:02:53,780 --> 00:03:01,170
connecting to our our business networks

00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:04,980
the next logical journey or step along

00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:07,530
that journey was DevOps and we're about

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:10,410
a year into that cultural transformation

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,790
and I say cultural transformation for a

00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:15,630
reason and I'll talk a little bit more

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:17,220
about that a little bit later there at

00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,530
the top of the chart you see some

00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,700
question marks what does the future hold

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,799
what's next

00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,590
before I get there I want to talk about

00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:30,930
that cultural transformation that we're

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:34,320
undergoing within DevOps as I said about

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:36,660
a year ago July of 2018 we intentionally

00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:41,010
did an organizational change

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:44,700
we took our architecture our development

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:48,030
our engineering and our operations and

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:53,299
we moved it together into the same team

00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:57,209
now just moving people to the same team

00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:59,370
isn't going to make everything work

00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:01,220
perfectly and make you know all of a

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,920
sudden you have a utopia DevOps world

00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:07,440
you have to change how you do the work

00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,380
and that's what we've been doing we've

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,239
been changing how we do the work we have

00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:15,450
developers sitting down together with

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:19,169
operations people working on in teaching

00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:21,270
how you do software and there the

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:22,890
operations people are teaching the

00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:25,440
developers what happens when your

00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,810
software doesn't work we're partnering

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,870
together like we've never done

00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:33,760
for the key there is we have a single

00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:38,389
organizational accountability now what

00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:42,230
that means is my boss and all my peers

00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:45,710
we all share the same goals now in the

00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:48,770
purest sense of the world word that's

00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:51,020
not DevOps and the purest sense of the

00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:53,030
word DevOps is a small team where you've

00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,790
got everybody on the same team and they

00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:58,669
go accomplish a task and that may work

00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:00,410
in a small startup world but in the

00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:02,720
world that set the scale of the network

00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,700
that we support that wasn't going to

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,070
work for us and so this is our hybrid

00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:09,080
approach and how we're approaching our

00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:12,250
cultural transformation changing how we

00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,690
work changing the types of things we do

00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:17,360
part of the reason we're changing that

00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:19,760
is because we're driving towards an

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,650
outcome we're driving towards an outcome

00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:26,780
that is declarative declarative

00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:29,710
predictability that's hard to say it's

00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,710
even harder to do

00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:36,700
declarative predictability to me is a

00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:40,370
world where automation thrives and

00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:46,070
execution is as predictable as a Sun

00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:49,039
rising in the east every morning for us

00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:53,500
our first example of where we have used

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:55,970
this declarative platform is airship

00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,130
airship is an open-source project in the

00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:00,680
OpenStack foundation that is a

00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:03,950
declarative lifecycle management and

00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:07,190
software tool platform actually it's not

00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:12,350
a tool it's a platform you submit yanil

00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:16,460
documents to it they're executed the

00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:19,070
artifacts are stored and then if you

00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,320
need to change them or make a change you

00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:25,100
edit them and then you repeat the

00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:27,350
process you have a single source of

00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:32,810
truth in that artifact that's stored in

00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:35,270
a in a repository that's a key for being

00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:40,300
able to maintain automation and maintain

00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:40,300
the ability to have predictable outcomes

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:53,850
predictable outcomes are generated by

00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:57,300
automation I believe that in the world

00:06:53,850 --> 00:07:01,680
we live in today and I have many debates

00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:04,350
with my operations peers most of us when

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:08,180
we say automation today what we're

00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:13,080
really talking about is mechanization

00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:19,889
we're talking about mechanization that

00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:24,030
is a tool that takes a single task and

00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:27,840
it automates that task and then you can

00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:30,690
run that task over and over again but

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,750
true automation is where you take the

00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:35,940
outcome of that automated task and you

00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:38,669
drive the next automated task you

00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:41,729
trigger that next task and you do that

00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:44,849
across the whole system and when you're

00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:50,330
doing that across the whole system then

00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:51,840
you get in to end automation in the

00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:56,160
telecom world

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:59,430
there's a saying thinking back into the

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:04,919
physical world of telecom that hands in

00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:07,080
the plant generate failures the more

00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:09,990
hens you have in the plant the more ops

00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,139
you are to have failures I would say in

00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:16,710
a software world that we live in today

00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:20,330
the that same thing same saying could be

00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:24,090
translated two hands on the keyboard

00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:26,729
generate failures and what I mean by

00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:31,560
that is today in the world we are living

00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:33,570
in today we still operate our networks

00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,400
the same way we've operated them the

00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:38,159
same way we've configured them the same

00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:41,520
way we typically manage them through

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,700
that CLI interface our operations teams

00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:47,810
want to have control and have the

00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:53,010
ability to go in and make changes and to

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:54,480
to fine-tune the network's my challenge

00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:57,690
to us is I don't think that

00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:03,480
works in our new world in our new world

00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:05,430
we aren't able to live with hundreds of

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,860
thousands of changes that are

00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,500
configuration changes driven by us

00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:13,500
driving our cloud driving out to the

00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:17,519
edge the what you know 5g is going to

00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:20,060
require so many more instances we have

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:24,410
to get to a point of true automation

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:30,149
because mechanization is is repeatable

00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:32,940
but it's not scalable one of the reasons

00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:37,050
in one of the ways we accomplish this

00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:40,050
with airship and how we went about using

00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:44,579
airship to power our network cloud is

00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:48,000
that we step back and we simplified we

00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:50,820
simplified how we established what was

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:56,310
going to be our network cloud we

00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:59,010
eliminated way too many flavors we had a

00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:02,040
lot of flavors of different types of

00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:04,649
applications for our internal cloud and

00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:07,649
so we took that and we consolidated it

00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:10,500
down to one there's an effort going on

00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:13,910
right now that are pit

00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:18,000
called CNT tea this is a similar effort

00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:20,250
where we as service providers around the

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,100
globe have banded together working with

00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:25,760
our vendor partners working in with the

00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:30,300
open source in the standards community

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:32,670
to simplify how we are defining our

00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,220
infrastructure how we are creating a

00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:38,130
common network function virtualization

00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,319
infrastructure and it's important to be

00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:45,180
able to do that and to create a finite

00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:48,899
number of infrastructures so that as we

00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:53,190
look to scale and we look to creating a

00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:55,949
healthy ecosystem we have the ability to

00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,810
control what we need to do and the

00:10:55,949 --> 00:11:00,779
ability to automate it and to move

00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:02,670
forward and automate it faster for us

00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:07,319
what we've done with DevOps

00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:08,340
has allowed us to really create savings

00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:10,010
within our

00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:13,529
organization and we've only been at it

00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:15,860
about a year one of the big areas where

00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:20,010
we've been able to generate savings is

00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:23,070
in shifting our testing left we've

00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:25,800
shifted our testing so that the testing

00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:30,510
that our ops teams used to do at the end

00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:33,720
of the process now is shifted left and

00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:36,180
being executed automatically through our

00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,640
development pipeline so that when we get

00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:40,770
to the end of the process of deploying

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,100
our sites and deploying our software

00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:46,560
it's a golden run of a test set of test

00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,990
cases and it checks it things off as

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,420
opposed to finding a lot of defects and

00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:53,730
that's important for us it's important

00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:57,930
for the speed it's important to be able

00:11:53,730 --> 00:12:01,680
to reduce the cost of testing and it's

00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:03,540
important that we get the these

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,930
reference architectures and

00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:10,080
implementations defined by C NT T and

00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:12,660
put out there into ovp and tested and

00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:15,120
have a place where people can go test

00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:17,630
against that infrastructure early and

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,339
often another thing that we did

00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:21,750
internally to AT&T that was part of this

00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,820
cultural change part of this

00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:27,600
transformation we're going through is

00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:31,080
that we started thinking about things

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,900
and especially automation by design in

00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:36,390
the past there was always a time to

00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:38,730
market push and challenge I mean how

00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:40,589
many of you have ever had a senior level

00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,750
person or a marketing person say just

00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:44,820
just get it done for time to market we

00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:47,640
got to get this product out we'll come

00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:50,160
back and automate it well we all know

00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,980
that cost us more money and takes us

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,790
more time and so we've made a commitment

00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:59,010
in the past year to go for that

00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:01,800
automation first to design it in by

00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:05,570
design and to start with the end in mind

00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:08,310
of automation that's allowed us to

00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:11,820
really focus and we've really come

00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:14,070
together as a team as as arpit said I've

00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,980
been around telecom for a long time I've

00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:19,740
never worked with a group of people

00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,510
together like we're doing now where we

00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,660
actually stopped and said

00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:25,740
we're going to shift this date out

00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:28,199
because we need to get this automation

00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,870
right now because it will save us in the

00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:32,670
end and everybody up the chain all

00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,769
across my peers and then up the chain

00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:37,250
agreed with us said it was the right

00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:41,250
decision and we actually shifted a

00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:43,230
launch date out because we wanted to do

00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,610
it right the first time those are the

00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:47,010
types of things that we have to think

00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:51,360
about as we're designing the

00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:53,579
infrastructures let's go back to the

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,010
future I was talking about the

00:13:53,579 --> 00:14:00,889
automation talking about what the future

00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:03,360
looks like there's a movie that really

00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:05,970
has nothing to do with technology but

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:10,290
there's a quote in it that I like and it

00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:13,010
says it's Tom Hanks in the face of a guy

00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:16,880
and he says you can't handle the truth

00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:19,550
well we need a single source of truth

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,190
we need that declarative predictability

00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:24,959
but guess what we aren't ready for that

00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:27,990
we're not ready for that yet we're not

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:31,500
ready for a world where you've got get

00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:32,430
ops at scale but that's got to be our

00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,339
North Star

00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:37,589
it's got to be where we're going we've

00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:39,779
got to put that out there as here's the

00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:42,389
goal we want to get to and then as we're

00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:44,699
working together across the community

00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:48,800
we've got to work together to that end

00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:51,920
and so my challenge to you today is

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,910
let's drive for simplification

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,980
especially in our infrastructure layer

00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,389
because let's face it we don't want to

00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,639
compete at an infrastructure layer

00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:01,800
that's not where service providers

00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:03,510
compete we should be working together to

00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,459
solve common problems that's what open

00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:07,829
source is all about so drive

00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:11,880
simplification collaborate on that

00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:14,910
infrastructure and automate the

00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:18,180
lifecycle management so that we can get

00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:21,640
to that North Star that declarative

00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:26,960
predictability thank you

00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,960
