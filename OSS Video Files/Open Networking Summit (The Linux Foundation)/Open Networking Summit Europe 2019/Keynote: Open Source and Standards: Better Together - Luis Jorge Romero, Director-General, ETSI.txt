	Keynote: Open Source and Standards: Better Together - Luis Jorge Romero, Director-General, ETSI

In the last years we have seen growing discussions at all levels, confronting the development of standards and the proliferation of Open Source projects. Experience and experts show that both, Open Source and Standards, are needed tools to better develop the systems and technologies that our society demands. It is not “one or the other”, but “not one without the other”.

good afternoon thanks a lot our pet for

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,670
the introduction thanks a lot

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:10,139
Linus foundation for having me here I

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:12,599
think it's awesome that I can be in

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:15,929
front of these very clever audience

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,699
trying to talk about standards now you

00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:21,330
can say who hasn't heard about that see

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:24,869
now you can say I'm not to him to me

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,730
in fact it's amazing because I could

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:29,039
basically sit down all that Arpit has

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,059
been saying about all that open-source

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:35,730
have been sitting throughout the years

00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:37,890
you change the word open-source you

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,680
insert the name of standards and there

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,750
you go my speech is over I think many of

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,050
the things are Pete was saying apply

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:48,809
very well to what we are doing hands

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,610
that I think it's very good that we're

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,860
getting to very good understanding

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,899
between our Pete his organization

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,449
organizations every other colleagues or

00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:02,520
something was saying to keep on pushing

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:04,500
it and to keep on bringing value so I'm

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,860
trying to give you a little bit of

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:11,130
background of about this open source and

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:14,040
standards this kind of battling that has

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:17,549
been going on in the press and actually

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:21,450
if you see presentations you will see

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:25,290
that we share many things we love

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:27,360
acronyms so as you have seen a criminal

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,909
all over the place sometimes we even use

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,869
the same acronyms which is not bad

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:38,400
so when FB and we see well that's that's

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:41,270
we love networking and in fact things

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,979
work with us because we collaborate

00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:46,619
collaboration is key is fundamental for

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:49,110
open-source is fundamental for standards

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:52,490
standards don't exist without

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:55,439
collaboration and hence I understand

00:01:52,490 --> 00:02:00,270
when people looked at us and said oh

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,689
these guys battling again it's one or

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,860
the other

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:07,229
clashing because they love acronyms they

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,690
love networking they try to make

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:13,230
business out of it of of collaboration

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,270
so one over the two are one-to-many in

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:21,680
this village

00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:24,959
so well in fact we share so many things

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,770
that it's not competing but cooperating

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,230
that we are after and let me see some of

00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:34,320
the thoughts that crossed my mind why I

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:38,720
believe this is the case and the first

00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:41,310
thought that's in my mind is well guys

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:46,530
it's an impossible battle because I

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:49,230
think we are kind of trying to achieve

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,910
the same which is cooperating to try and

00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:55,290
develop something that's good for the

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:58,410
industry avoiding fragmentation but we

00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:00,959
do it in a cooperative manner in the

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:04,200
sense that when you get to the standard

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:08,700
it's something which is kind of bolted

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:10,860
down and well fundamental when it comes

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:14,040
to developing to the real projects that

00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,950
come out with a product then how you do

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,860
it probably open source is the way there

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:24,600
are many other ways and we need those

00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:27,079
two to blink clinging together and it's

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,670
it's important because not for us

00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:32,160
several times people tell me and well

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:34,860
what do you think well don't ask me I'm

00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,350
just facilitating what industry what

00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:40,650
people who are really doing the job have

00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:44,850
to do so to me

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:47,390
there is no single question of well do

00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:51,630
you do that standards or open-source

00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:53,130
guys that's not a question that's not

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:56,070
really the question there are several

00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,380
questions inserted there or embedded

00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:01,730
there the first one is do we need

00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:06,930
standards we may not need standards

00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:10,410
there are specific reasons why we would

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:13,350
go to do something standardized and not

00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:16,019
always we need to go standardized and

00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:20,579
the second one is how do we want to

00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:23,729
implement a solution and by the way it's

00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:26,919
not first one than the other you could

00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:29,139
very well start working on something

00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:31,330
without thinking of standards and some

00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:35,259
point in time think saying who by the

00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:38,139
way the best manner of spreading this

00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:39,610
around and and enabling that there are

00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:42,699
several ways of implementing and

00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:46,629
solution is by standardizing the basics

00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:48,599
and allowing the world to develop in

00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:52,629
different fashions why not

00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:56,289
so it's not one first the other second

00:04:52,629 --> 00:05:00,270
it's not one or the other it's deciding

00:04:56,289 --> 00:05:04,180
what's it that we need

00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:07,300
having said which what do standards

00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:12,939
provide why why standards why would you

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:14,770
say let's go for standards sometimes you

00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:18,580
need to establish a threshold and you

00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:20,860
need to fix the threshold and that's why

00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:24,279
we you could say well let's go let's

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:30,210
have this standardized particularly when

00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:35,349
it comes to responding to queries or

00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:38,189
requirements from regulation so you need

00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:45,539
something to refer to that's kind of

00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:48,310
cast on stone then you need standards or

00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:51,009
of course you need interoperability you

00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:55,629
need different implementations being

00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:58,930
able to work with one another and that's

00:05:55,629 --> 00:06:02,080
what we try to do when you go to the

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:05,860
process in standards you will see that

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:09,399
it goes from ok requirements then you go

00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:11,830
to architecture protocols and in the

00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:13,930
implementation we try to validate we try

00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:16,479
to implement and validate that the

00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,550
different pilots comply with the

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:22,050
standard but then are able to

00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:24,879
interoperate with other implementations

00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,210
you don't need to see what's inside the

00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,379
box

00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:30,659
Jesus Lee to see that this box is

00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:33,370
interchangeable with this other box

00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:35,649
regardless of what's inside you need to

00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:39,969
verify these interfaces that's what

00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:40,870
standards look at so basically we are

00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:43,090
developing

00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:48,840
all this interoperability that's what or

00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:48,840
why you would go and point at standards

00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:57,490
but we are not blind to the world we

00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,290
don't say well you know we've been doing

00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:01,030
that for

00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:07,210
Cillian years 20 at least that I can

00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:10,780
think of and you know or even 30 and we

00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:15,640
have so many you know great success

00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:19,030
stories to tell where we started and

00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:24,520
then probably all of you carry one or

00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:28,000
several mobile phones that actually are

00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:31,240
in your pockets because of standards who

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,160
remembers the 80s and what mobile

00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,970
telephony was in the 80s because there

00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:41,800
was mobile telephony in the 80s but

00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:44,740
unaffordable and today what we have is

00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,230
amazing nobody could have a think of it

00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,960
15 years ago

00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:53,590
all enabled because people got together

00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:56,260
and made it happen so why should we

00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:58,060
bother well we do bother because we see

00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:01,000
the things develop in many different

00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:07,740
manners so we are ready to learn we are

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:10,060
ready to cooperate because indeed

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:13,570
implementation cycles we need to be

00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:16,840
faster we understand that the process

00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:19,120
works it's extremely important that we

00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,800
have solid governance models because

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,130
otherwise it's very difficult to bring

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:28,560
all the community and bring their ideas

00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:32,530
and their knowledge and share it with

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:35,920
their competitors and from there keep on

00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:39,430
building on the research and innovation

00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:43,420
so how we do how do we do that and how

00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:46,080
we enable that all these people can come

00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:48,760
and work together and get to agreement

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,780
earlier because let's not forget that

00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:54,760
part of the long cycle or the long faces

00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:59,750
in our standards project

00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:03,080
camps from trying to get consensus which

00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:05,900
is basic so once we have that the point

00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:12,740
is well how do we do better so that our

00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:16,550
whole process kind of improves so first

00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:19,640
of all go and learn how our other

00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:22,010
community is doing and of course the

00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,270
first thing we saw is well how is the

00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:27,080
software community how is the

00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:29,900
open-source community doing how can we

00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,210
get more out of that what other tools

00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:34,610
they use what are the methodologies they

00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:37,610
use what are the processes they use how

00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,950
they come to agreements how they work

00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:42,130
with each other

00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:45,860
that's what we have been doing for now

00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:49,130
two or three years with our people back

00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:52,340
in Etsy so worried what it is that that

00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:56,960
is work were these the things cannot be

00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:58,870
softened have to still be tight and of

00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:02,120
course that's something we couldn't do

00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:05,990
just by reading books that's not just

00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:09,770
something we could do just back in our

00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:14,720
offices without doing anything just by

00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:18,020
taking notes and that's how all of the

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,330
sudden because it was not started by us

00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:23,540
all of the sudden we had a project in

00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:26,720
our hands which was a true open source

00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:29,150
project we had all the theory on one

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,180
side we had all our people having

00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:35,210
learned how to do things and all of a

00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:37,550
sudden our members because something I

00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:40,310
want to remind everybody that it's not

00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:43,940
me it's not our organization that

00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:47,120
decides what we do its Etsy members who

00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:50,480
decide what they want to do so they came

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:54,650
and said well you know we are working a

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:59,990
lot on the standards in NFV and we have

00:10:54,650 --> 00:11:03,020
a real need of developing really the

00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:05,480
manual layer how do we do that this

00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:08,210
component we need to develop we haven't

00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:13,490
we haven't found how to do it

00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:15,170
will you help us so of course what do

00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:19,250
you what do you answer your members when

00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:22,970
they ask something sure let's go for it

00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:25,580
and that's how this adventure of open

00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:28,720
source man is started with few members

00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:31,700
bringing together the knowledge with us

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,709
putting and facilitating their work

00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:37,100
bringing the tools that we have learned

00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:40,580
how to use bringing the governance model

00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:47,200
that we have adapted a little bit to our

00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:50,750
own needs and learning as we run and

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,779
this is quite successful from our point

00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:57,800
of view it's a very focused project but

00:11:53,779 --> 00:12:00,770
has helped us to learn a lot and to keep

00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,860
on bringing new ideas new opportunities

00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:08,180
within Etsy that helped us being better

00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:10,310
in the standards process and at the end

00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,320
of the day we have been able to start

00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:14,930
several other initiatives of course IMS

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,060
is quite old and we have seen how

00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:20,360
different communities have brought and

00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:23,810
taken IMS and developed open-source

00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:26,510
implementations we started a tool inside

00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:30,400
of Etsy on this test language

00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:33,860
description open source project whereby

00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:37,820
we are basically developing a tool using

00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:39,589
open source methodologies middle box

00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:42,020
securities a demonstrator that we have

00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:44,240
done also inside of one of our technical

00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:47,120
committees and there are several

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,640
implementations of the one M two M one M

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,060
two M is our cabin surface layer for

00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:55,550
Internet of Things and we have several

00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:59,540
again implementations based on open

00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:03,829
source of responding to the needs of

00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:08,450
this architecture so we keep on trying

00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:10,579
to work and push and facilitate all

00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:12,740
these development of specific projects

00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:20,150
that at the end of the day have to see

00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:22,220
the light in the commercial area and in

00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:25,699
the midst of all something that

00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:29,410
I'm very happy about and I usually bring

00:13:25,699 --> 00:13:31,880
forward with great fraud is the

00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:34,449
cooperation agreement or the agreement

00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:37,639
that we have with the Linus foundation

00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:41,930
because our Pitt was talking about it I

00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:45,019
will insist I think is very very welcome

00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,560
from the communities he said it I will

00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:49,029
repeat

00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:54,259
we don't want the solutions to fragment

00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:57,829
we want that all of you can focus and do

00:13:54,259 --> 00:14:00,290
your business and can interoperate and

00:13:57,829 --> 00:14:02,060
that's why we try to bring all people

00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:04,930
together we try to bring all people to

00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:08,649
cooperate there are concrete activities

00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:12,220
looking at this and we will keep on

00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:16,060
fostering and we'll keep on promoting

00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:18,259
cooperation amongst both communities

00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:21,319
because that that's beneficial for the

00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:27,170
business and that's a role helping this

00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:31,279
business so I'm not gonna go too long

00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:38,230
with that because I think the message is

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:38,230
clear that we need to work together

00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:46,220
being together is the only way in which

00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:49,339
we will help our communities bloom we

00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:52,300
will help our communities keep on going

00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:58,069
forward and doing their business

00:14:52,300 --> 00:15:01,940
we standard open-source are serving

00:14:58,069 --> 00:15:05,959
different purposes but coming together

00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:08,630
to the same end we benefit from each

00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:12,260
other how we work how we establish

00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:16,790
things it's it's just very nice

00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:20,089
symbiosis if I may say we need to foster

00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:23,449
that we need to help our people that to

00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:25,819
do that cooperation is of the essence

00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:27,769
but that's obvious it's it's been inside

00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:29,839
the open-source communities it's been

00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:33,589
inside the nine foundation it's been

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:35,600
inside Etsy since the beginning no

00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:38,769
cooperation no standards

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,839
straightforward actually no cooperation

00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:45,920
Etsy wouldn't exist that's what brings

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:48,889
HC together and at the end of the day

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,470
and I will I will repeat our Pete's

00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:54,829
words we are not here for the sake of

00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:57,410
being here we are not here a standards

00:15:54,829 --> 00:16:00,620
body for the sake of filling in shelves

00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:04,759
with lots of nice books that doesn't

00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:08,180
help our success is measured in terms of

00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:11,720
how many standards are being implemented

00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:15,680
and and being profitable in the

00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:19,670
marketplace how many how much of that

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:22,540
production is bringing back a return we

00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:26,600
won't be right on every single thing we

00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:30,829
start it doesn't matter as long as we

00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:33,980
are enough successful in what we bring

00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:35,990
forward and again I think this mutual

00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,630
cooperation is this way of bringing

00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:41,380
things together will help us being even

00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:44,689
more success successful at the must

00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:48,380
least uncontained cost which is what I

00:16:44,689 --> 00:16:51,910
guess our members are looking for having

00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:56,110
said which let me again thank you all

00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:58,220
for having a standard sky talking about

00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:00,560
standards and a little bit of open

00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:02,630
source and of course I look very much

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:06,260
forward to this continuous cooperation

00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:09,049
and happy to answer any questions that

00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:11,089
might come either now or later on during

00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:14,369
coffee break so thank you very much

00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:19,649
again and see you later I hope

00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:19,649
