	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,259
good morning everybody as Arpit said

00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,609
there's been I think a theme going

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,610
through the keynotes we've heard so far

00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:10,650
in terms of the importance and the

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,380
challenges around integration the

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,940
importance of interoperability and the

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,410
ways that we need to solve that as a

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:21,539
community so as we sort of continue to

00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:25,619
discuss this along our journey we have a

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:27,180
panel on compliance and verification we

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,340
have a number of different perspectives

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,500
including a leading open-source vendor a

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,480
long-standing interoperability and

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,579
compliance test lab of course an

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,230
operator and an important standards

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,530
organization that has long supported the

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:43,140
mobile ecosystem we have decided to

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,340
actually do the format of this panel a

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,980
little bit differently as you might

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,770
guess from seeing this interesting setup

00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:51,840
inspired by the TV game show Family Feud

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,949
we have divided our panelists into two

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,110
teams

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:56,370
people will bez in first person to hit

00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,070
the buzzer gets to speak

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,930
we also are limiting answers to a minute

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,359
so you will actually be able to see the

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,549
timer countdown and you as the audience

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,100
is actually going to act as our survey

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:11,580
sets so I hope that you can get into the

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,159
spirit of this of this panel so our team

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:17,460
blue is made up of Beth Cohen from

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,070
Verizon and Henry Calvert from the GSMA

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,520
team red is made up with Tom Nadeau from

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:27,220
Red Hat and Lincoln Lavoie from UNH IOL

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:38,659
so panelists come forward

00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:38,659
[Music]

00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:45,860
so I am NOT richard Dawson but I will do

00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:50,420
my best to lead us in this game so let's

00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:53,930
play Open Networking feud all right

00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:57,500
first question to our contestants given

00:01:53,930 --> 00:02:00,140
that operators will still have to do a

00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,880
fair amount of in-house testing given

00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,330
that we're not going to probably get to

00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,470
one size fits all for our infrastructure

00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,539
and given that there will still be some

00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,729
things that are specific to any given

00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:12,739
operator where do we get the business

00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:14,590
value how do you define it in what

00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:17,690
quantitative and qualitative

00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:19,700
descriptions or metrics so first panel

00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,050
sorry first question what is the

00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:25,760
business value of compliance and

00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:28,100
verification for you survey says

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,959
so let me make a statement first which

00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:34,760
is that open source and standards are

00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:38,390
not free so us as operators obviously

00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,459
need to make investment in you know

00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:43,220
joining these communities and the reason

00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:47,200
we do that is because it affects our

00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:52,130
bottom and our top lines in a good way

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:55,700
so for our bottom line it means that we

00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:59,620
can be time-to-market is faster because

00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:02,420
we can rely on the shared resources of

00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,610
of the open standards and the open

00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:07,280
source communities and the labs to

00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:09,709
support our efforts across the operator

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,890
community there's a lot of hard problems

00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:14,480
that the operators have to do and

00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:19,430
sharing the burden is only going to help

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:22,660
as Amy mentioned you know infrastructure

00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:29,989
is hard and it's not our differentiator

00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:32,720
so all right let's throw the question

00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:36,019
over to our other family so how do you

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,180
think about describing and either

00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:39,850
quantitative or qualitative fashion the

00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:45,079
business value of a compliance program

00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:47,050
we need to buzz in at least I didn't say

00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:50,050
that was easy right

00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:52,240
so no it's it's about creating like a

00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,800
commonality I think right and and

00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,090
getting things that level of

00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,090
interoperability I mean there's been a

00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:00,670
huge amount of talked so far about like

00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:03,460
CN TT what it's it's attempting to

00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:06,880
deliver and will actually kind of allow

00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:09,070
that ecosystem to build itself up where

00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,700
you can actually kind of undo that

00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:15,160
siloing of vnf and the NFB I and and the

00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,440
direct linking that it has to have to

00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,540
allow the portability it's gonna make

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:24,370
this all kind of be able to grow to

00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:26,320
scale so okay team red has still 22

00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,180
seconds on the clock does do you want to

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,760
add anything yeah I just want to echo

00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,680
some of the some of the kind of the

00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,260
points that you just made but they were

00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,030
also echoing echoes in the presentations

00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,730
from the beginning Matt for example

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:42,700
mention this about the the advantages of

00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:46,510
this kind of consolidated thing the

00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:48,880
other thing is that we're that's

00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,400
important is the integration perspective

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:55,960
[Music]

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:59,770
all right so sort of to I think general

00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,840
a themes here on the one hand open

00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,850
source and standards are not free but

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,169
the investment it does impact the bottom

00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:09,540
line on the other hand sort of the

00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:12,790
Portability and interoperability of

00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,680
integrated system so survey says this is

00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:23,250
you audience

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:23,250
team blue all right here ed

00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,060
I also think survey might be saying I

00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,860
need more coffee which unfortunately is

00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:36,470
not an answer on the board

00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:39,000
all right so second question contestants

00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:42,800
we we are used to in the telecom

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,840
industry programs around standards-based

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,060
certification we've done them we sort of

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,729
know how they look as we've been looking

00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,949
at how to do compliance and verification

00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:54,120
in open source where some of the code is

00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:56,580
there but we've still got

00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,470
interoperability challenges one could

00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,240
definitely argue that we need to think

00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,490
these programs through perhaps in a

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,289
different way but also learn from what

00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:08,430
we have done in certification in the

00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:10,470
past so contestants what do you think

00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:13,110
are the most important sort of

00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:15,150
characteristics of a compliance and

00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:17,550
verification program and open source and

00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:21,840
how is it either similar or different

00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:23,340
from what we've known in the past this

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,380
one I think actually is really easy I

00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,780
mean this has been a fundamental driver

00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,370
of the way we've structured ovp from the

00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,430
beginning which is it's about the

00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:35,460
community it's about a community process

00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:37,410
and that that's everything from the the

00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,000
entire story arc of what is

00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,680
certification and what does that mean

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,210
right like it's the setting of the

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,650
requirements where are those coming from

00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,750
getting the community buy-in

00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:47,700
getting the and when I say community

00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,410
buy-in that really does include the

00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,910
customer buy-in to from the operators

00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,039
that those requirements are going to

00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,169
meet their requirements and their needs

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,270
it's getting the community biown on how

00:06:55,169 --> 00:07:00,090
that testing is implemented and designed

00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:02,550
in such a way and then it's also making

00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:04,289
sure that there is a review process and

00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,849
a submission process that actually

00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:09,330
aligns well with the open source and

00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:11,599
then lastly from that is who actually

00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:13,919
does the testing right so traditionally

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,630
and being allowed I'm saying this

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,849
traditionally in black it was always in

00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,870
a single lab whereas we've tried to move

00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:21,030
to a process where it can actually

00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:25,770
involve the entire community being able

00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:29,900
to submit the results into that Pro Team

00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:32,099
Blue I think care from the juice made

00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:34,620
the buzz in you right that's going to

00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:36,600
lose three seconds

00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,430
from the GSMA point of view looking at a

00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,870
bit of the history you know the best

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:42,150
words that are coming out that I just

00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:45,660
love our collaboration and consistency

00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:47,970
and GSA has always really driven the

00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:51,540
operators to be interoperable to drive

00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:53,520
scale okay so if we have consistent

00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:56,370
profiles we call it profiles in our

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,070
language in the operating community if

00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:01,350
we have consistent profiles that you are

00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:04,530
actually known it reduces the number of

00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:06,510
test cases that have to be done on the

00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,190
boxes or on the systems or the software

00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,870
or the stacks or the distros that you're

00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,580
actually putting out there it reduces

00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:13,470
the number of Castaic case studies

00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,720
because they become learnt and they

00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,669
become well understood and people can

00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,650
drive through that very quickly that can

00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:21,150
only happen through collaboration if

00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,770
you're actually doing it in a silo

00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,630
you're doing it for yourself you're not

00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,070
doing it for others and that is what

00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,229
we're trying to bring together with CNT

00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:31,770
tea is an actually understanding of that

00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:33,479
knowledge to make sure the consistency

00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:36,930
is going to drive less testing that has

00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,820
to be done let's go let's actually let

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:43,919
one more person buzz in for this

00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:46,050
question yeah just add to that one of

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,380
the things that's important to add to

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:53,490
what my colleague said earlier is that

00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:55,080
is that not only do the specs explain

00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,600
what needs to be tested but they can

00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,330
actually be implemented by the vendors

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,540
so it's important that the community

00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:06,480
includes not just the operators but also

00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,610
the vendors and they do it in a way that

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,360
you know we can we can test what needs

00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:14,550
to be tested and then make it work I

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,730
want to I want to add to that operators

00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:19,470
and testers operators and the vendors

00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,730
and the entire community has to

00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:27,060
participate it fails if we don't do that

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:30,870
that is essential right okay so let's go

00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:33,330
out to survey says first answer that we

00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,339
heard was one of the important aspects

00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:39,180
of doing an open source compliance

00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:41,490
program is that it aligns with sort of

00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:44,100
open community processes and that the

00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:46,690
governance of the program is open and

00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,090
the test labs themselves are open

00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,010
answer to about the importance of the

00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:54,550
repeatability and the way to take

00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:57,190
learnings from that answer 3 somehow

00:09:54,550 --> 00:10:03,400
split magically between team blue and

00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:05,080
red is that it is about sort of the

00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,070
involvement of the vendor community

00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:15,400
alongside the operator communities

00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:17,410
survey says answer one survey is still

00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:25,780
saying I want more coffee all right

00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:31,630
survey says answer to the team answer

00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:34,090
three all right honestly I think those

00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:36,730
are all right answers and they all

00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:38,200
actually dovetail into each other if you

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:40,210
might notice I just worked in the word

00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,600
dovetail which is the name of one of our

00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:45,340
compliance projects in OPN Fe but

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,860
actually they do dovetail in together

00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,900
that the way that we look at things from

00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:53,110
a compliance perspective in open-source

00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:55,180
is for it to be a more open process that

00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,890
we want everyone working together that

00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:59,050
we want to take the learnings public

00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:01,480
that we want testing to be able to be

00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:03,430
done in a variety of ways but that we

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,500
also want to get consistency and

00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:09,810
interoperability and take things from

00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:12,940
there all right so question three

00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:16,120
panelists I think this one I hope this

00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:18,580
one is a bit provocative so we've been

00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,440
hearing a lot about cloud native and I

00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:23,980
think there's a recognition that cloud

00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:27,010
native is an incredibly important thing

00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,540
that we you know sort of both in terms

00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:30,550
of the technology but more in terms of

00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:34,030
the process around things like CI CD

00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:36,940
DevOps etc so if we are thinking about

00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:38,860
networks is actually being moving to

00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,630
something like DevOps and CI CD

00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,400
constantly changing that the

00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:44,860
applications are going to be constantly

00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,900
updating whether those small changes

00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,600
constantly into production which I know

00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:53,230
is still a lot of times a goal for many

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,630
of us in telecom so if we think about CI

00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,880
CD if we think about cloud native if we

00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:59,320
think about DevOps as important drivers

00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:03,280
for the future of

00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:05,770
industry is a batch based compliance

00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:08,590
program actually sort of the right thing

00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:10,330
for us to be focusing on you know

00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,890
there's a certain assumption of

00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:14,080
stability and version control and

00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:18,730
version numbers perhaps built into that

00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:21,880
so third question is is a compliance

00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:26,020
program incompatible with or compatible

00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:29,050
with and if so how with CI CD and agile

00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:33,430
and you know revolutionary cloud native

00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:36,280
networks Tom I should have guessed that

00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:38,950
actually it would be Red Hat it's

00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,810
critical given the the nature of how

00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,670
people do business today and software I

00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,640
mean we saw several presentations with

00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:48,280
stacks of various components and testing

00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:51,700
that integration is paramount to the

00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:55,120
thing working and and and and so the CI

00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:56,800
CD pipeline is actually a way that you

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,740
can do that in a distributed way with

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,930
different vendors contributing also

00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,670
integrating ovp tests for example in

00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:05,800
that whole thing so it's it's really

00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:09,370
critical to the other thing being

00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:11,620
successful I think I'll still love her

00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,930
any time of I actually think it's a part

00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,820
of the CICE process right and so like

00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:18,340
there there's always going to be a

00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:21,060
driving force to actually move the

00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:23,320
software through that badging program

00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,450
creating the value that that has there

00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,600
from the industry into the customers as

00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:29,920
part of going into that CI CD process

00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,680
and stuff like that and if you look at

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,600
like that combined with the NFB I layers

00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,360
and what you're trying to come out of

00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,310
that's where we're aiming yeah actually

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,140
I'm going to because I think there was

00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:43,810
something interesting there so as the

00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:46,990
host I get to arbitrarily change the

00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:48,880
rules on stage let's let's actually give

00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,140
you another team read another minute on

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,620
the clock to talk about this particular

00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:55,900
right so you got to start from somewhere

00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,100
right like it you've got a day zero

00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,050
thing that needs to come out so if

00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,510
you've got a badge that you're using to

00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:04,390
kind of set some bar on that initially

00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:06,280
you're getting to kind of a base state

00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:08,740
that you know what it is and where it's

00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,680
going to start from and then from there

00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,579
you start running your CI CD processes

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,679
internally

00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:17,170
and relying on the upstream stop be

00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:18,819
doing similar and again back to a

00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,019
community thing contribute back to the

00:14:18,819 --> 00:14:22,689
community so that those upstream

00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:24,309
processes start to align with like your

00:14:22,689 --> 00:14:26,199
needs and make me for the community

00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:28,629
processes are fulfilling their roles too

00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:31,239
and then as you're pulling in new

00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:34,239
devices new vnfs if those are badged and

00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:35,860
those have you know some level of

00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:39,730
testing coming into it before they come

00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:42,759
into your space then that even better

00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:44,499
suits your environment initially to run

00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:45,759
on top of something else that was bad so

00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:51,939
it's kind of building that complete

00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:58,660
ecosystem all the way and even gotten to

00:14:51,939 --> 00:15:01,360
the end of his buzzer bass okay you have

00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:04,839
now stolen the question so all the

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,879
question so I would argue that the cloud

00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:10,269
native is going to make everything that

00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:13,179
much more difficult so the reality of

00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:16,179
the work of of the operators position is

00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:19,209
operators have become integrators it's

00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:21,790
not what we officially do for a living

00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:25,089
but that is what we do to support what

00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:26,769
we do for a living and the not that I'm

00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:28,179
against testing I'm not at all of course

00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:31,239
against testing

00:15:28,179 --> 00:15:33,129
I love testing but I think that all the

00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:36,339
cloud native stuff that's coming is just

00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:40,029
going to make testing just super hard so

00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:42,249
that's the challenge you're stealing

00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:46,749
from your own teammate I love this give

00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:50,259
people buzzers and look what happened to

00:15:46,749 --> 00:15:51,790
challenge I'm used to I think I think

00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:54,399
there's a definite once you've got your

00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:56,439
infrastructure sorted out and you're

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,329
developing on top of that then you know

00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:59,860
the repetitiveness becomes easier but

00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:02,709
it's a massive cultural change for

00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:06,730
operators who really basically do

00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:08,679
Murphy's Law thank you you can reset the

00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:11,169
clock you can have some more time you

00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:12,819
deploy something and you don't touch it

00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:19,119
because you don't want it to break at

00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:21,279
all which is just not DevOps and that

00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:22,869
brought it up he basically says you

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,149
build your capability that you actually

00:16:22,869 --> 00:16:25,820
got and then you're you're developing on

00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:27,800
top of

00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,150
and that will bring X period that will

00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,890
bring customer experience I'll bring

00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,660
other value benefits that you can see

00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:35,210
very quickly so I don't think we should

00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:38,240
be afraid of doing deployments and

00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:40,090
patches and upgrades every day you've

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,200
just got to have a confidence in

00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:43,340
frustrated in your infrastructure that

00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,460
it's going to work it's going to be

00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:48,800
there yeah I was gonna say that just to

00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:52,270
add to that you can't agree then it's a

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:55,280
feud I have to agree it's a reality

00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:57,080
fluidity the fluidity of the integration

00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,390
and what you're just talking about the

00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:03,500
again the many pieces parts and the

00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:06,040
evolution the constant evolution the the

00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,510
quote earlier you know embrace it or die

00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:11,300
right I mean that's the reality and the

00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:14,180
cloud native makes that like you were

00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:16,220
saying the it invites even more of that

00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,680
and so unless we can embrace it with a

00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:21,980
consistent CI pipeline and testing

00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:23,510
strategy it's gonna be difficult making

00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:27,110
that work just because it's hard doesn't

00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:29,990
mean you can skip it right so actually

00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:33,800
I'm done I'm actually intrigued sort of

00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:35,390
by what you said Beth because on the one

00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,070
hand so you're saying sort of the

00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:39,620
introduction of cloud native is going to

00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:41,810
make things more challenging from a test

00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:44,120
and integration perspective on the other

00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:46,160
hand if I talked to sort of a cloud

00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,110
native developer they actually will say

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,340
sort of the things like automation and

00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:53,930
CI CD and the you know building and

00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,930
system testing maybe and from the

00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:58,400
beginning should make things easier

00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:01,930
maybe we could get some disagreement

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:05,480
once again is the panel debates you know

00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:07,730
do well actually I'm just going to you

00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,770
can still use the buzzer but but Tom I

00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:11,360
mean do you agree with Beth that going

00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,640
cloud native will make it more

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,780
challenging I I do I mean I don't I

00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,120
don't think we're gonna go back to a

00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:19,610
world of manual testing you know I mean

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,370
the the the presentations today what

00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:25,130
we're seeing in the industry and again

00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:26,540
it's it's getting more more complicated

00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:29,090
but it's but it's getting more

00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:31,840
complicated for a reason and again

00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:34,910
because it's hard doesn't mean we can't

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,640
can't test it and make it work right but

00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:39,710
it requires that we do that

00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:43,730
team team blue everybody had something

00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:45,950
so in controversy which is that at the

00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:48,020
end of the day it's about the operations

00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:51,280
because that's what we live and die on

00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:54,380
and if we don't have that cellphone work

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,120
100% of time we're in trouble those are

00:18:54,380 --> 00:19:00,170
men right all right we have five nine

00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:02,120
six 9s la's and you know our operations

00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:04,940
people freaked out over this stuff

00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:08,179
because they they want it to be so

00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:10,669
reliable they want to know that it's

00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:11,750
gonna work so this is this is coming

00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:15,470
down to the difference I think between

00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:17,330
like test and production versus a CI CD

00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:19,429
pipeline that's actually testing before

00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:23,500
deployment though right and how do you

00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:23,500
do those best practices that do both

00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:27,830
anything from our from our other

00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,330
panelists see I'm getting nice as this

00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:32,510
is going on and getting everyone a

00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:36,140
chance to speak yeah I mean we've seen

00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:38,270
this as software brings flexibility into

00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,040
networks okay and that can get a

00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:41,540
complete double-edged sword and we're

00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,520
discussing this all the same but it was

00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:46,190
the same when we brought vault Ian volte

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,950
is a highly configurable software

00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:51,290
application on a device and in a network

00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:53,360
effectively and and and the very

00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:55,370
different variants we got around the

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,530
world is phenomenal and I've spent the

00:19:55,370 --> 00:20:00,290
last three years sorting out all those

00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:02,360
differences that's consistency if we can

00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:03,890
get to a consistent this is the

00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,169
consistent infrastructure we've got to

00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,910
provide then the other experience

00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:09,290
applications on top are going to come

00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,880
and the value is going to come at the

00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:13,370
end of the day but that consistency is

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,080
so important so to get the base core

00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:17,120
infrastructure I get the tastes and

00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:20,000
procedures for that right and then

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,410
heart's content go for it you know on

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,230
the software on the service and software

00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:26,690
layer you know fun one final question

00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:29,990
and this one we are going to do properly

00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:33,169
families feud style what do you think is

00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:36,169
the most important priority for the sort

00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:38,120
of next thing to do for us as a

00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:42,080
community in our compliance and

00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:44,240
verification program right we are going

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,710
to do the timer this time so the most

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,320
important thing in compliance and

00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:49,940
testing is testing the real things so

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,200
this this is the biggest challenge

00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:55,220
upstream right now my

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:58,360
our the the vnfs and the CNF in ovp

00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:01,970
testing and so on are not the production

00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:03,830
vnfs and CNF and to your point if you

00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:06,799
really want to solidly test that thing

00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:09,110
before it goes to production to meet all

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,960
of your your specs we need to do that

00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:14,090
otherwise we have to do it back in the

00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,850
lab you know a private lab or whatnot

00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:20,330
so doing that upstream that's that's a

00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:22,820
key ingredient I would add you knew I'm

00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:29,120
gonna steal you steal until the time so

00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:31,309
I have lived the the vendor who you know

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,700
we were in production the vendor hadn't

00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:37,220
done their job and we had to take it

00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,899
into the lab and say no guys what you

00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:42,049
told us was wrong

00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:47,750
and that you know that put egg on our

00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:50,779
face with our car right so I just add

00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:53,630
just to add tag on your face what I mean

00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:56,419
like I think that the biggest next steps

00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:59,090
is to get the community resources in

00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:01,750
place to do exactly that to actually be

00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:03,980
able to test these real things on

00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:06,740
commonly identified infrastructure

00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:08,990
commonly identified you know stacks you

00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,850
know and and we've all said that that's

00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:12,830
the whole point of like what is

00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,210
OpenStack what is Opie NFV what are the

00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,350
integration projects and the testing

00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:17,210
projects that we're doing there but

00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:19,340
we're not yet doing that fully as a

00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,929
community right otherwise we wouldn't be

00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,850
putting the efforts into something like

00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:25,190
CNT tea and stuff like that so let's

00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:27,860
take that let's actually then you know

00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:29,630
build the reference architecture build

00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,700
the reference implementation to actually

00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:33,980
stand that up and then give that as a

00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,570
community resource to then bring in the

00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:37,850
rest of the parts and the pieces to that

00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:40,610
pipeline to actually make that happen

00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:42,169
and we can tick all the boxes at the

00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,850
same time that we talked about at the

00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:46,039
beginning of this in terms of like how

00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:47,690
do you do the open programs of allowing

00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:50,029
that to feed back to like a badging

00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:52,840
program so that when Verizon or AT&T or

00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:55,429
others bring in something they're loud

00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:59,029
alright Team Blue any last rebuttal or

00:22:55,429 --> 00:23:01,549
addition to that just for Beth you know

00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:03,680
I've spent 20 years in in operators

00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:05,809
mainly in Asia

00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,400
when something goes wrong it's the

00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:10,610
operators name that's out there in the

00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:12,320
press yeah and they suffer badly that is

00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:15,110
that is the real reason everyone gets

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,450
very touchy about the performance that

00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:19,520
is actually delivered I think we need to

00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:22,490
collab we've got to collaborate we've

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:27,260
got to set the right expectations those

00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:29,840
expectations will lead to success and my

00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:32,660
last statement is we need more suppliers

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,220
in the industry yes we have got a

00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,110
drought or supplies we've got some

00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:39,559
brilliant suppliers out there don't get

00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:42,470
me wrong but we need more diversity in

00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:45,020
our supply chain let me let me add to

00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:47,420
that we have a whole bunch of partners

00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:49,790
and vendors that we work with who aren't

00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:52,309
participating in this in these tests at

00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:55,220
all yeah that was my point that's a

00:23:52,309 --> 00:24:02,300
significant problem for us all right

00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:04,610
so all right survey says now I'm trying

00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:07,910
to remember what everyone said that's

00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:09,890
the real thing test the real thing more

00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:14,690
resources into the community to build

00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:17,570
the tests more vendors more vendors so

00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:21,290
related to resources and performance

00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:25,840
testing so survey says answer one come

00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:25,840
on come on come on yes yes

00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,160
survey says answer two

00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:41,480
survey says answer three by the way

00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:53,240
she's the customer so really the right

00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:57,260
answer is always that one okay so ending

00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:59,240
on a slightly more collaborative and

00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:01,460
serious note I hope that you have had

00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,500
fun with our format we wanted to shake

00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:06,049
things up get a little bit of back and

00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,640
forth I hope that you have enjoyed the

00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:09,919
way that we've set up the gameshow I

00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:13,210
have ideas for next year I think next

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,210
year I want to play the weakest link

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:21,200
maybe not but you know we're sitting up

00:25:19,429 --> 00:25:23,299
here dividing and teams and buzzing in

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,770
IO because it's you know because it's

00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:27,230
fun because we want to express different

00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:29,120
opinions and we want to debate but the

00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:31,280
the reality is that we do all

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,200
collaborate with each other I work with

00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,870
all the people on this stage every day

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,570
we are all really in the same boat as an

00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:40,640
ecosystem you know to make this

00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:43,610
successful really does require all of us

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,620
working as a community and so on that

00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:47,690
note we've got a little bit of time left

00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,520
so I'm going to give one minute on the

00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:52,610
clock for any last thoughts around

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:55,070
community collaboration and sort of

00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:57,860
success around this in open source and

00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:00,590
we'll start with Henry and one minute on

00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:03,590
the clock all us panels for one sort of

00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:06,799
final thought I think the activity we

00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:10,549
see in CT of course is bringing the

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:12,559
collaboration and the consistency

00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:15,530
together that we actually need in the

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,120
testing environment it is there's a lot

00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:19,669
of effort that has to be put down that's

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,530
completely we respect that but the

00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:25,790
benefits are known and they are actually

00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:27,770
are large we want to there is a wider

00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:30,140
community we have to reach it it's

00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:33,500
phenomenal how big that community is

00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:35,059
their vendors not turning up and and and

00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,850
everyone needs to be talking off the

00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:40,460
same message for this to actually work a

00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:43,040
bit of unity is good competition is

00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:45,410
always our problem okay it is the

00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,420
downfall that we actually have

00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:50,810
so let's see if we can just take that

00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:53,630
whilst we develop the testing and the

00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:55,820
conformance plans to get things right

00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:57,050
let's just put competition to the to the

00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,860
side a little bit and work

00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:04,490
collaboratively together

00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:08,020
alright you ended early well done it is

00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:08,020
so much fun to hear that buzzer isn't it

00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:16,580
so what I'd like to say is that there's

00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:19,670
there's a lot of as Henry mentioned

00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:21,620
there's a lot of competition that really

00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:25,190
isn't the competition you know Amy

00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:26,960
mentioned earlier yeah telecoms compete

00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:29,330
they don't compete about infrastructure

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,640
cuz nobody none of our customers give a

00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:34,820
crap about our infrastructure they just

00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:37,580
want it to work and and we want our

00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:40,900
vendors to make sure that it works for

00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:45,110
us because as Henry said it's our name

00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:46,670
on that and you know if it goes down who

00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:49,580
called you know who do they call they

00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:52,420
don't call Red Hat they call Verizon

00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:55,850
we're not in the press release you are I

00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:57,740
know it's exactly right so so you know

00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:59,120
we need to all work together to solve

00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:03,880
this problem because we're not going to

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:07,250
solve it separately it makes no sense

00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:12,290
all right let's reset the timer for mr.

00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:13,730
Lavoie so the buzzer is fun I'm gonna

00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,830
build a little bit on what Henry said

00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:17,810
which is is talking about kind of that

00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:20,060
competition and like can we create some

00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:21,770
processes an environment where we can

00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:23,180
kind of put that aside for a little bit

00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:25,130
and I'm thinking specifically around

00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:27,070
like the plugfest events and stuff that

00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:30,110
we have right in terms of like let's

00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:32,300
create create the community resources

00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:34,310
that we need to be able to enable this

00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:36,290
testing create the environment where

00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:39,710
that testing can actually take place and

00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:41,180
can take place where it we try to set

00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:42,590
aside or push away some of the

00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,450
competition for a little bit and

00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:46,700
actually work collaboratively to solve

00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:49,670
the problems and stuff to actually build

00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:52,220
this and pull in that those that best

00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:54,020
practice that lesson learned contribute

00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:56,330
back to it and then push that back up to

00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:59,030
the community resource pool ie the open

00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:00,710
source programs the ovp programs and the

00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:02,390
that that testing is structured such

00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:04,130
that we're actually kind of building

00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:05,930
that complete picture that then the

00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:08,150
DevOps team and everybody can pull

00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:10,010
internally to their processes at the

00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:13,820
operator and stuff like it's being done

00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:19,570
at Red Hot and similar right all right

00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:21,920
finally mr. Nutter steal the buzzer

00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:23,870
beware if he shows up in any of your

00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:26,360
sessions later in the week these will be

00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:27,830
great for the next conference going yeah

00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,620
for me it's really simple there's

00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:32,540
there's really three ingredients to this

00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:36,530
recipe right is we're talking about

00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:38,870
collaboration consistency and using the

00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:42,230
real things and and those three things

00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:45,260
combined I think will get us you know

00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:47,270
the cake we're trying to make and and

00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,800
and that's the kind of the theme that

00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:50,930
runs through everything we've been

00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:55,130
talking about today so for me it's is

00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:56,870
really simple all right with that I'm

00:29:55,130 --> 00:30:00,860
going to now declare myself

00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:04,850
survey says so survey says all of y'all

00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:07,880
are awesome and great sports we have a

00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:10,430
challenge ahead of us but I believe in

00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:14,690
the power of community and ecosystem to

00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:16,430
do it and Thank You audience for waking
