so thank you for joining us at the

00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,950
second open networking summit in Europe

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,800
as you know NS has been going on for

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,179
almost a decade now but this is the

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,130
second time we are doing it in Europe

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:20,090
and before I even get started I want to

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:23,580
sort of sank the events team for this

00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:29,310
amazing venue so can we get a big round

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:31,470
of applause for the events team I mean

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:35,610
we do conferences all the time but this

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:38,250
is you know amazing and even better it

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:42,090
is symbolic right if you have been to

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:45,090
one of the tutorial rooms there's a

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:48,750
there's a skeletal skeleton of a whale

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:52,140
hanging from the ceiling and it reminds

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:55,320
me of proprietary technologies right so

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,899
very very apt and here we are open

00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,539
networking summit so before we get

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,910
started and I give you my sort of share

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,450
some views here some housekeeping

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,799
announcements obviously first of all we

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,369
want to thank all of our sponsors

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:14,220
diamond sponsor Ericsson and of course

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:16,799
platinum Suns sponsors CN CF Huawei and

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,960
open tap and then I want to thank the

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,140
program committee this their their job

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,150
is really hard if you have if some of

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,350
you are here if you're not you know

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,350
familiar with how they do it

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:31,740
CFPs get submitted they look at it and

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,930
then figure out the best content that's

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,799
possible for you guys now I'm also

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:41,060
pleased to report this time we organized

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:46,950
the content in sort of five tracks

00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:50,430
you know IOT and edge a IML 5g and

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:54,090
networking ops cloud native network

00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:56,880
enterprise IT etc and so they had a

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,500
tough job but again can we get a big

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,729
round of applause for the program

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,729
committee thank you

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:08,649
now if you don't like some of the

00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:10,420
sessions it's them okay but that's not

00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:13,090
gonna happen I can try I can guarantee

00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:14,770
you that the other thing is there's a

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,380
schedule on the go so you have your

00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:19,980
batch there's you know just scan the QR

00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:23,140
code and you will get that right away

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,370
also as you can see some of the

00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,140
conference rooms so there are five

00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:29,770
conference tracks and two unconference

00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,750
tracks some of them are half of them are

00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:35,230
on this floor which is I think they call

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,760
it the first floor and then the others

00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,670
are on the ground floor right below us

00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,860
so you can see all that and then the

00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,930
networking app so for those of you who

00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:47,260
want to connect with others here you go

00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:49,870
it's very easy to join I have heard a

00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,910
lot of good feedback from from the

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:56,590
attendees on this one so please do it

00:02:51,910 --> 00:03:00,160
and then of course the the free stuff

00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:03,489
right so your batch gets you into the

00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:06,340
zoo during lunch hours for free and

00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:10,450
that's what we love right the networking

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:12,250
folks love free so please do that please

00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:16,239
take advantage of that I believe it's

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:17,920
all three days we can get access and and

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,720
then of course there's the coffee and

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,230
breaks in the technical showcase

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:29,549
downstairs so with that let me go ahead

00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:32,350
and sort of start with my few thoughts

00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:34,570
so I thought let's let's look at the

00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,100
last one year and then look at five

00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:38,700
years and then look at the next five

00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:42,209
years and kind of what has happened

00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:45,850
significantly that has revolutionized

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:48,820
the open industry and I could capture it

00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:52,750
in one sentence which is community

00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:55,180
collaboration to commercialization so

00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,400
the question is what next and how do i

00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,840
frame the whole thing and so what I

00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,239
thought would do is I'd share some

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,299
thoughts on sort of the journey till

00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,980
date ah where the next three years are

00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:09,040
going and make some old predictions for

00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:11,620
2025 now keep in mind for the press out

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,230
here I'm going to sprinkle some of

00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,100
course cool news and some hot news right

00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,230
in here as

00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,840
press releases come out and I'll point

00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:22,750
out obviously on what those things are

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,930
so let's start with the journey journey

00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:29,080
has been very very fast in just the last

00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:31,030
five years there were projects that got

00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,800
created projects mood to products

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,480
products mood to profit community

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:39,730
collaboration mood to commercialization

00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:43,720
right what got us there open disruptive

00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:45,970
technology virtualization technology

00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,130
disaggregation technology automation

00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,350
technology and cloud native technologies

00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:52,360
these you know if there was no

00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:55,810
technology we would not be here so let's

00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,690
kind of baseline that but with the Sdn

00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:01,960
nfe with the Manoa and orchestration and

00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:06,030
with containerization right the these

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:08,560
are the building blocks of the open

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:12,010
community and we're really excited to

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:15,610
host you know a lot of these projects

00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:17,770
here but let me walk you through how we

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:21,550
think about and how the community thinks

00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,990
about the lifecycle so this diagram some

00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,510
of you may have seen it in some of the

00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,880
Linux Foundation fraud conferences but

00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:31,030
it's a very simple visual that says

00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,040
first comes projects then come products

00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:35,350
then comes deployments then come profits

00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:39,100
profits get reinvested in projects and

00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:42,190
the cycle keeps repeating a successful

00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,120
open source project requires a full

00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,070
lifecycle

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,510
we have had projects that go through the

00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:49,630
whole thing and then they're shelled and

00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:51,550
that's okay right it didn't create

00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,410
enough value projects do you need to

00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:58,690
create value so let's talk about the

00:05:53,410 --> 00:06:01,630
projects well we have majority of the

00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:04,660
projects in networking that are hosted

00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:06,640
by the Linux Foundation obviously for us

00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,560
it's really a stack diagram the data

00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,980
plane projects at the bottom with the

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,780
NASA at next control plane next man oh

00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:16,150
and then analytics right so these are

00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:18,130
all the projects that we have hosted or

00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:20,800
are in the process of hosting and are

00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:24,550
hosted by our partner communities around

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,860
us which we collaborate with right so

00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,770
that's the project so now the question

00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:32,460
is what's new well

00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:35,880
what's new is we are announcing that opx

00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:38,759
which is a project open switch is now

00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:41,460
part of Linux Foundation networking

00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:44,250
umbrella right so this is the seed code

00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:48,479
came from Dell and we are really excited

00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:51,870
that you know Dell technologies now has

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,970
has decided to move this under lfn lfn

00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,800
community has accepted it it's going

00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,590
through the induction it's it's an

00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,590
amazing sort of disaggregation nice

00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,630
white box open networking software that

00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:05,340
people can take advantage of and we're

00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:10,409
really excited to have this project as

00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:14,159
part of of elephant okay while we were

00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:17,099
doing the projects we also decided that

00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:20,009
our friend in in this journey together

00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:23,069
is the standards community right five

00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:25,020
years ago you would have said oh it is

00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:27,419
it standards that we are going to follow

00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,639
or is it open-source standards which is

00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:31,530
bid which becomes a de-facto and we

00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,539
change that mindset and we are really

00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:35,550
happy about that because you know you

00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:38,219
got pretty much some of the largest of

00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:41,610
the organization's all collaborating

00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:44,909
formal agreement very closely aligned

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:46,469
and very consistent api's and models

00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:47,610
right and this is important because at

00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:49,320
the end of the day you don't want to

00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,719
implement two different fragmented

00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,190
solutions so very excited about the

00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:54,349
harmonization that we have been talking

00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:59,190
about okay

00:07:54,349 --> 00:08:01,020
and so projects then move to products

00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:03,930
and this is where the journey gets

00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:06,569
exciting how do you get a commercial

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:08,699
ecosystem develop around open source and

00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:10,830
how do you make sure that there's

00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:13,080
business value for the members and

00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:15,840
non-members to take advantage and then

00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,909
start putting commercial offering for it

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:23,009
alright so let's see some proof here

00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:25,819
right a whole set of commercial projects

00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:29,159
and this is just one project around onap

00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:31,349
you got pretty much the largest of the

00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:32,250
large vendors the medium-size vendor

00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:34,169
startups

00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:38,699
you've got system integrators in there

00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:41,610
so arson there silicon companies huge

00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:43,100
global ecosystem all of a sudden with

00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,200
the latest release in

00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,210
that are now part of this commercial

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,520
ecosystem either they are supporting it

00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:52,120
or distributing it or customizing it or

00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,800
building their products around it and

00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,710
for the developers you will recognize

00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,350
the one circle or the three concentric

00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:02,990
circles in the middle this is diversity

00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:05,870
right so the first release of own amp

00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:08,030
inside that's the smallest circle had

00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:11,000
maybe five ten companies contributing

00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:13,940
but as the releases get more and more

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,920
the size of contribution from different

00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,830
companies increases the color of the

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,530
pide of the circle difference this is a

00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:25,120
sign of a good open source project right

00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:27,350
high diversity equal contribution and

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,420
you know clearly that doesn't mean the

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,190
the size of or the contribution from the

00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:33,320
largest of the large keeps decreasing

00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:34,910
it's just everybody else is contributing

00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,670
a lot more so this brings up the

00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:39,820
commercial ecosystem very important

00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,770
because that's kind of the products

00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,340
another example from Linux Foundation is

00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,630
db/decade

00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,030
right this is the data plane

00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:49,160
acceleration project and it's kind of

00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:51,770
distributed by commercial vendors it's

00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,570
consumed downstream by a whole lot of

00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:55,220
open source projects and it's in

00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,710
production in some of the largest clouds

00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:00,230
and and some of the service providers

00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:02,930
again you can see the flow of how a

00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:06,530
project makes it into production right

00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:09,230
and so how do you get it to production

00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:12,020
and this is the hard part this is the

00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:14,960
boring part I hate to say there is no

00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:17,480
silver bullet here okay it's just hard

00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,280
work you know we call it the plumbing

00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,920
layer we call it whatever but how do you

00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:26,690
do it well you do it with a whole set of

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:29,660
proven tactics that include blueprints

00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:33,590
so these are use cases that actually

00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:35,270
have code that is implemented in a

00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:38,450
reference architecture and a reference

00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:40,040
model you have solutions that are built

00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:42,950
end-to-end hardware and software

00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,810
included obviously you have use cases

00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:47,210
that are important to the community and

00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:49,970
then very very important is you have a

00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:51,830
more formal compliance and verification

00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:53,420
program so under lfn we have something

00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:56,720
called a VP which I'll talk about in a

00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:58,550
bit these programs are needed to excel

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,760
the deployment and then you have

00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:04,300
training and you have documentation and

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,160
you have interrupts and plugfest right

00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:09,170
just just work there's no silver bullet

00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,540
you have to do all these things to get

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:14,720
from products to deployment and when you

00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:17,540
do it you see the success and that's

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,330
another example look at the deployments

00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:23,690
that have gone up right you know I won't

00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:26,690
read it out but AT&T China Mobile Orange

00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:29,630
China Telecom Verizon Bell what up on TT

00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:35,230
Turk Gio oh you can just read read the

00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:38,420
list from parks to production right

00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:40,760
almost 70% of the global mobile

00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:43,040
subscribers are participating in in open

00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,440
source projects so effectively in just

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,260
the last five years we've seen a dine

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:52,340
you know drastic shift from from just

00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:54,530
being you know a lab project to going

00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,970
into production and using open source

00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:58,370
technologies so we're really excited

00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:01,340
about that now obviously one small thing

00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:04,250
is operators that are participating in

00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:06,650
elif networking projects are doing six

00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:09,700
times better this is just based of

00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:13,430
public data in grabbing mobile shares

00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,570
market share in their region I don't

00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:18,800
know if it's causation or correlation

00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:23,150
you can decide okay but I'll take it

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:25,760
all right so this is good and then the

00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:29,950
last part which is profits very exciting

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:32,510
and how do you get to profits right and

00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:35,120
what how do the deals get done well

00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:38,690
the good news is in just the last

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,180
quarter all these things came up

00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:43,370
I could not fit it in in one slide right

00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:46,640
and our marketing guys could not also so

00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:50,630
we'll just leave it like this lots of

00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:52,850
deals lots of deals because the up and

00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:54,620
and the deals are very simple it's like

00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:58,220
the operator or the end user would say

00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:01,010
ah I want to build it on open source who

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:03,530
is participating okay I feel comfortable

00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:06,080
because they support my strategy because

00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:09,200
I want innovation I want control I want

00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,190
you know faster deployments so let's

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,350
just do it all right

00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:15,920
and that's kind of what what we have

00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:18,680
seen in in the commercial deals so the

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:22,940
news then which we put it on the wire

00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:24,740
last week in preparation of ons is LF

00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:27,650
networking it enters the commercial

00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,680
phase projects are now doing going

00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:32,900
through the commercialization both with

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:36,020
ecosystem and commercial vendors and

00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:37,100
end-user deployments and obviously the

00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:41,000
community keeps growing

00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:42,710
we welcome globe telecom one of the

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,720
largest operators in Philippines right

00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:49,060
80 million Plus subscribers starlight

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:51,590
etc again we're excited about just a key

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:54,650
key momentum that OH

00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:56,420
LF networking is continuing and then of

00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:58,280
course what's the most important thing

00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,930
that we are focusing on deployment and

00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,850
within deployment what's the most

00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:03,110
important compliance and verification

00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:05,660
because you're gonna cut down the

00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:11,810
interoperability time so today we are

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:14,390
announcing that o we P oops sorry there

00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:17,930
you go or we P are the compliance and

00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:21,620
verification program which is partnering

00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:26,570
with GSM a and C entity is issuing the

00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:28,910
first spec of common n FBI profiles

00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:31,850
right so this is our one you know we

00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:35,330
announced this program at ons na in

00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:38,360
April and very quickly the reference

00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:42,080
models are the profiles through GSM a

00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:44,720
are being published today okay and this

00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,730
is again one of the pieces of the

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,590
overall compliance program because the

00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:52,220
rest of it comes from you know the whims

00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:55,910
OpenStack own app from a mana

00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:58,400
perspective and vnfs onboarding from

00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:01,750
from that and OPN fe is going to sort of

00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:04,850
do the test tooling and automation to

00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:06,740
comply and and get the vnf sun boarded

00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:09,950
very quickly we're seeing tremendous

00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:12,140
momentum on this and you know we are

00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:16,220
even going to have a webinar on this

00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:17,600
through SDX central to explain what the

00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,970
details are and how you can participate

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,370
but go ahead and and kind of look at it

00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:23,839
as well so this is really exciting piece

00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,809
of work

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:29,660
and that's where we are so where do we

00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:32,899
go now right there are three things edge

00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:35,509
access and cloud native and I'm not

00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:38,600
going to go through all of these because

00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:41,359
you will have keynote presentations from

00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:45,709
all of this and let's start off with

00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:47,809
edge where's the edges right so we have

00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:49,730
this age-old question what do you define

00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:53,059
edge as and what's edge computing and

00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:57,709
what's not and the good news is with a

00:15:53,059 --> 00:16:01,009
project called glossary we have taken a

00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:04,779
very proactive approach to define edge

00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:07,689
as having three characteristics

00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:10,160
proximity of compute and storage

00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:13,429
responsiveness so five to 20

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,139
milliseconds of latency and mobility for

00:16:13,429 --> 00:16:16,970
connected cars and things like that

00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:20,029
right so an application that requires

00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:23,509
all three is an agile edge application

00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:26,929
and and and that framework is is is four

00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:29,720
edge so if you extrapolate that not all

00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:32,329
IOT is edge you know you can't have a

00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,189
censored waking up every week and then

00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:36,369
dumping data into a centralized public

00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:40,549
cloud that's not an edge application

00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:43,279
simultaneously not all edge is IOT right

00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:45,529
it could be a telecom edge it could be a

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,049
cloud edge Enterprise edge or an IOT

00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:51,439
edge and our goal here at LF edge is to

00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:54,259
unify this across many many of these

00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:56,359
verticals and the primary verticals that

00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:59,259
are interested in this is obviously

00:16:56,359 --> 00:17:04,010
manufacturing oil gas retail commerce

00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:05,689
homes automotive etc so really exciting

00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:07,100
things happening here on the edge and

00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:09,679
under the LF edge and if you're not

00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,809
already you know a partner member

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,329
community supporter please go look at it

00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:17,389
right and so what's the announcement the

00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:20,779
announcement is that we have two new

00:17:17,389 --> 00:17:24,949
projects that are being inducted - LF

00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:29,029
edge there beetle and fledge they are

00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:30,950
frameworks that help you you know get

00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:34,760
into the cloud edge so this one came

00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:37,490
from from Baidu and a beetle and then LF

00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,970
edge which is a which is an application

00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,270
framework

00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:43,490
for the industrial IOT that one is also

00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:46,280
going to be inducted and we have a new

00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:48,890
set of members obviously this keeps

00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:52,070
growing along with our existing projects

00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:53,780
like at Reno regex foundry etc so good

00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:55,789
progress here the press release is going

00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:58,250
to be out right after this keynote so

00:17:55,789 --> 00:18:00,440
we're excited to welcome these two new

00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:03,650
projects okay

00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,070
and then one takeaway for you on the

00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:07,280
edge

00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:08,000
you thought cloud revolution was big and

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,240
you missed it

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,580
edge is going to be four times the size

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:16,190
okay and it's gonna hit four trillion an

00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:19,630
economy so if you're not going to

00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:25,700
participate in edge all good luck right

00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:28,370
but let's move on so access Iran isn't

00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,830
going through a significant change here

00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:33,440
okay and we have a whole keynote from

00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:38,140
orange on on this but what I want to do

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:41,600
is I want to sort of say that Iran is

00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:43,010
now software or ran disaggregation is

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,590
leading to a whole bunch of things in

00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:49,250
software and we are hosting the software

00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:51,289
community for doing this and we're

00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,179
starting to see a lot of progress being

00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:55,610
made not just from the Orang Alliance

00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:57,710
which is defining the specs but from the

00:18:55,610 --> 00:19:01,700
software community that is developing

00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:05,000
the software to the industry consortiums

00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,770
on creating test beds for testing the

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,230
RAM okay so we're really excited to

00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:11,600
partner with with the ecosystem here but

00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:13,789
that's your next big thing that is going

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,220
through the change and you will hear

00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:18,230
more about this keynote and then finally

00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,400
on cloud native everybody has heard it

00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,350
some of you may have gone through

00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:25,400
tutorial Dan's going to be here talking

00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:27,049
about it as a keynote here but the thing

00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,870
that is important for the telecom

00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:32,059
industry is we're living in a world of

00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:35,090
hybrid virtual machines and containers

00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:37,700
right as as vnfs

00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:39,409
go through CNF s-- right there is some

00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,360
of them needs to be read and some of

00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:43,730
them are migration there's a lot of work

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,000
that's being done by both CN CF

00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:49,250
kubernetes NLF networking community and

00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,710
we are going to collaborate here to make

00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,990
sure that we have a good

00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:56,240
set of Understanding on what the

00:19:53,990 --> 00:20:00,320
employment is what the migration is so

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:03,080
clearly big-ticket item here and you're

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,390
gonna hear a lot more about this so when

00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,669
we bring it all together it's a very

00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:12,860
simple open source world right you have

00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:16,220
edge open open access you come in you

00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:19,549
get to open edge you go into the core

00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:21,620
and you have a whole bunch of projects

00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:24,500
that are dedicated to do their functions

00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:28,460
and then the standards organization like

00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:30,279
Mac or I I see collaborate to make sure

00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:33,440
that whatever spec comes in is

00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:36,380
implemented properly okay so that's the

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:39,980
whole picture I want to leave you with

00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:41,380
sort of three predictions for 2025 as we

00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:45,679
walk through the whole journey

00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:48,770
the first one is sorry it's more of the

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:51,830
same okay so we we tend to do this you

00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:54,470
know 6 g 7 g speeds feeds devices sulfur

00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:56,510
ization we're on a pretty good roll here

00:20:54,470 --> 00:21:00,500
as an industry and I think it'll

00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:02,929
continue the second big prediction is

00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:05,840
edge computer overtakes cloud compute

00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:08,210
okay and this is where I believe that

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,059
telcos have an advantage they have an

00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:13,070
advantage of location okay

00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:15,049
that's your smart central office that's

00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:17,419
your radio base station where you can

00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:19,370
actually put compute and storage and run

00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:22,580
a software stack on it with zero-touch

00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:25,429
automation right huge progress there and

00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:27,950
I believe that we will see public cloud

00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:30,020
 playing catch-up on this I'm sure

00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:31,820
they're going to you know come up with a

00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:35,779
very innovative strategy but at least

00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:38,299
the initial initial feedback is that

00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:40,789
this is going big and then of course and

00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:42,830
and by the way I can stand behind these

00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:44,990
predictions but the third one I can

00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:48,679
definitely stand behind it's guaranteed

00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:53,659
to happen we'll still be working on

00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:57,049
next-gen networking okay so kit that's

00:21:53,659 --> 00:22:00,770
the key takeaway all right so with that

00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:05,150
I think I I have one more thing and that

00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:08,180
is we're going to move

00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:11,600
and change Open Networking subs summit

00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:12,950
to now o NES or we able to expand the

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,070
scope of it it's gonna be open

00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:19,100
networking and edged summit okay

00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:22,340
starting next year in April in North

00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:24,320
America in LA it's going to you know

00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,510
we've seen so much excitement and

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,210
enthusiasm that you know we've decided

00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:29,900
to do this so please spread the word

00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:32,750
around

00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:34,580
it's a NES I know people like

00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,850
pronouncing at different ways but it is

00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:41,420
o NES I'm gonna repeat it three times

00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:46,520
and then in the fall we will have a NES

00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:48,860
in Europe and here this right here okay

00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,260
so we're gonna have the same venue we

00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:53,770
love it so much that we're gonna keep it

00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:57,470
here alright so with that I would say

00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:59,500
enjoy learn meet your peers take

00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:01,910
advantage of you know some of the

00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:05,330
smartest people that have developed this

00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:07,020
technology and with that I'm gonna thank

00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:12,960
you

00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:12,960
